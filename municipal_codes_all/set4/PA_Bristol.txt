PREFACE
The Township of Bristol has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change
common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the
time of the establishment of the Township, subsequent growth of the community, together with
the complexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the
proper function and government of the Township. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal
history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and
consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection
of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more
than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and
logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as
these in mind that the Township Council ordered the following codification of the Township's
legislation.
Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation (ordinances and certain
resolutions) of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Township Council of the
Township of Bristol, including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary
by the Township Council in the course of the codification.
Division of Code
The Code is divided into parts. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all Township legislation
of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of government, that
establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the
municipal government and its departments. Part II, General Legislation, contains all other Township
legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties
for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do not.
Histories
At the end of the Scheme (list of section titles) in each chapter is located the legislative history
for that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was
derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number,
resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing
parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of each part or
article is indicated in the text, under its title. Amendments to individual sections or subsections
are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.

BRISTOL CODE
General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General
References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's Notes are
used in the text to provide supplementary information and cross-references to related provisions
in other chapters.
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of
the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions
are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this publication is reserved
for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include.
Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation, indicating its inclusion in the publication
or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement
to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this publication will be used by persons
without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate
a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The Index will be
supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added.
Instructions for Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or additions, should be
adopted as amendments to the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively
altered should not be renumbered.
Adding new sections. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at
the end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing
sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between §§ 65-5 and 65-6 should be designated
§ 65-5.1).
Adding new chapters. New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in
the appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation),
utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word
for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles,
Abandoned" under "V" in the Table of Contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement
devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under
"A" in the Table of Contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should
11 06 -15 - 2005
PREFACE
be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 193 and 194 should be designated
Chapter 193A).
Adding new articles. New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g.,
adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to
be included between Articles VII and VIII should be designated Article VIIA). The section numbers
would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article VIIA contains six sections and existing
Article VII ends with § 205-34 and Article VIII begins with § 205-35, Article VIIA should contain
§§ 205-34.1 through 205-34.6).
Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation or
amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible
after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old
pages removed, in accordance with the Instruction Page which accompanies each supplement.
Acknowledgment
The assistance of the Township officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The codification
of the legislation of the Township of Bristol reflects an appreciation of the needs of a progressive
and expanding community. As in many other municipalities, officials are faced with
fundamental changes involving nearly every facet of community life. Problems increase in number
and complexity and range in importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning.
It is the profound conviction of General Code Publishers Corp. that this publication will
contribute significantly to the efficient administration of local government. As Samuel Johnson
observed, "The law is the last result of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the
benefit of the public."

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Tools for Finding Information–In addition to the municipality’s legislation, this publication
contains tools to help locate information: table of contents, index, chapter outlines (schemes), and a
disposition list.
Chapters–Chapters are generally discrete pieces of legislation but can also be made up of several
individual pieces on a related topic. In that case, the individual pieces are arranged into articles or parts
within the chapter. If you are familiar with a former number or title, look for it chronologically in the
disposition list.
Reserved Chapters–In the numbering of chapters, space has been provided for the convenient
insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. Help in selecting an appropriate number for a new chapter
is available from the editor. See also the “Instructions for Amending the Code” in the Preface.
Section Numbering–A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed. Each section of
every item of legislation is assigned a number, which indicates both the number of the chapter in which
the item of legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the fourth
section of Chapter 6 is § 6-4.
Scheme–The scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are
carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the
chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision of
reference, the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.
Page Numbers–A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an
autonomous unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and
the numeral “1.” Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 6:1. By the use of this system, it is possible to add or to
change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages.

§ 1-2. Effect of Code on previous provisions.
The provisions of this Code, insofar as they are substantively the same as those of the

shall be entitled to a lump-sum payment of the DROP account balance, and the participant’s
survivor(s), shall receive the applicable benefit in the event of the death of a retired officer
or while killed in service, whichever is applicable.
G. The monthly pension benefit calculation and limitation on pension accrual. After the
commencement of the DROP participation period and the effective date of the DROP notice,
the officer shall no longer earn or accrue additional years of service for pension calculation
purposes under the plan. No benefit increases that may occur after DROP participant’s
commencement date, including bargained pension enhancements, mandated pension
enhancements through arbitration or pension enhancements mandated by law, will apply
to the DROP participant and shall not increase the DROP participant’s frozen pension
under the plan, as calculated on the commencement date of the DROP participation period
as stated in the DROP notice. From the period beginning on the commencement date and
ending on the member’s resignation date, the participant’s monthly pension payment shall
not be paid to him or her but shall instead be transferred into the participant’s DROP
account. The average monthly compensation of the participant for pension calculation
purposes shall remain, as it existed on the commencement date as stated in the DROP
notice. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the
calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the plan. The pension benefit
payable to the member shall increase only as a result of cost of living adjustments that may
be applicable and in effect under the plan on the retiring officer’s last day of employment
with the Township prior to entering the DROP and becoming a DROP participant.
H. Sick leave cash out. A member who elects to become a DROP participant may cash out up
to 360 hours of sick leave immediately prior to DROP entry for inclusion in pensionable
salary.
I. Maximum participation. The maximum period of participation in the DROP program is 48
months. On the participant’s resignation date, as stated in the DROP notice, his or her
employment with the Township (and DROP participation period) shall terminate
automatically.
J. DROP pension payments. Upon the commencement date of the member’s entry into the
DROP program, a DROP participant’s service and average monthly compensation (as each
is defined under the plan) will be determined and his or her pension payment will be
calculated as if he or she retired and ceased employment with the employer on the effective
date of such officer’s DROP participation period as stated in the DROP notice. The pension
32:12 12 - 18 - 2014
§ 32-23A PENSIONS § 32-23A
benefit payable to the member shall increase only as a result of any applicable cost of living
adjustments in effect on the effective date of the member’s participation in the DROP or by
applicable cost of living adjustments granted thereafter. The monthly pension payments
that would have been made on and after the commencement date and prior to the DROP
participant’s resignation date shall be credited to the participant’s DROP account under the
plan.
K. Accumulation of the DROP account. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been
payable had the police officer elected to cease employment and receive a normal retirement
benefit shall, upon the police officer commencing participation in DROP, remain in the plan
but shall accumulate to the sole benefit of that officer until distribution to the officer or the
beneficiary. The DROP participant’s accrued benefit accumulation under the DROP shall
be calculated annually and provided to the DROP participant. The assigned rate of return
on the participant’s DROP account shall be the actual rate earned by pension plan trust
fund but such amount shall not be less than 0% nor more than 4.5%.
L. Distribution options. Commensurate with DROP program participation, a member must
make an election on forms designated by the Township of the payout option(s) desired upon
termination of the DROP period. This election may be changed at any time before
termination but such elections must be consistent with the options available under
applicable law, 53 P.S. § 895.1114 (d).
M. Beneficiary designation. Commensurate with DROP program participation, a member must
make an election, on forms designated by the Township, of the beneficiary or beneficiaries
they intend to receive the balance of the member’s DROP account in the event of the
member’s death before such balance has been distributed.
N. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP plan shall be consistent with the provisions
covering the deferred retirement option plan set forth in any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and shall be binding upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP
participants who have balances in their DROP accounts. The DROP plan may only be
amended by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of the Township
and the association and ratified or approved by the appropriate body of each party, not by
any oral agreement or past practice.
O. Interpretation of provisions. This document shall be interpreted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and applicable Federal law. An officer’s election to
participate in the DROP program shall in no way be construed as a limitation on the
Township’s right to suspend or terminate an officer for just cause or to grant the officer an
honorable discharge based upon a permanent disability that renders him or her unable to
perform his or her police duties. Nothing provided hereunder shall be construed as a change
to the parties’ practice of calculating pensionable compensation. Except for the ability to
establish a DROP account and participate in the DROP, nothing herein is intended to create
new pension benefits of any kind which did not exist as of or prior to January 1, 2013.
Nothing provided hereunder shall guarantee any officer or DROP participant a specific term
of employment. All DROP participants shall be subject to the same terms and conditions of
employment (except those relating to benefits under the plan and retiree benefits), rules and
regulations and disciplinary procedures as other officers and members who are not DROP
participants.
P. Costs of DROP. The plan will pay any costs of the Township and the plan as it relates to the
administration of the DROP program or DROP accounts.
32:13 12 - 18 - 2014
§ 32-23A BRISTOL CODE § 32-28
Q. Compliance with a future law. The Township and the association and all current and future
DROP participants (as a condition of participating in the DROP) recognize that the
provisions of the DROP plan shall be severable and if any of its provisions shall be held to
be unconstitutional or illegal the validity of any of the remaining provisions of the ordinance
shall not be affected thereby. It is expressly declared as the intent of the Township that the
DROP plan would have been adopted had such unconstitutional or illegal provision or
provisions not been included herein. In the event that the DROP plan, or any part thereof,
is declared invalid or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, the police officers shall
have the right to bargain in accordance with Act 111 over the impact of the change in this
benefit. To the extent an issue regarding this DROP is not addressed above, this DROP shall
be interpreted in compliance with 53 P.S. § 895.1101 et seq.

§ 34-20. Construal; administration.
The following rules and regulations are not meant to conflict with Bristol Township
Directives, the union contracts or published and approved departmental regulations and
procedures. The aforementioned directives, contracts and regulations shall prevail over these
rules and regulations in the event of conflict. However, the following shall be considered the
basic rules and regulations governing the conduct of those in the employ of the Township of
Bristol. Discipline under these rules will be adminiStered through the appropriate department
head, subject to the direction and approval of the Managing Director.
34:13 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 34-21 BRISTOL CODE § 34-22
§ 34-21. Changes; notice; responsibility of employee; master copy; questions.
A. As the Township continues to improve benefits or update its policies, changes in the
Township of Bristol rules and regulations may be required. Employees will be informed
by written notification of all revisions. However, the Township cannot assume the
responsibility of updating an employee's personal copy of the employee rules and
regulations, and it should not be referred to as a legal document as the employee rules
and regulations are not an employment contract. For the employee's convenience, a
master copy will be available from each department head or the Managing Director's
office.
B. If an employee has any questions concerning these policies, he or she should talk to his
or her supervisor or department head.
§ 34-22. General policies and procedures.
A. Regular working hours shall consist of shifts as prescribed by the union contracts, the
Executive or departmental policy as set from time to time. Starting time will be
determined by the department head. Each department shall establish starting, lunch and
quitting time for the respective groups of employees.
B. All equipment, tools, etc., are interchangeable between departments and divisions of the
various departments at the discretion of their department heads. All personnel are
interchangeable amongst the various departments in accordance with existing laws.
C. If for any reason overtime is necessary, permission for such overtime must be obtained
through the department head, who will be guided by directives issued by the Managing
Director except in cases of emergency.
D. Certain limited services are provided on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Work on these
days shall be as assigned by the department head.
E. Special working hours and shifts may be assigned to personnel from time to time to meet
the need of the Township's responsibility to the people.
F. All releases of information which may become public must be cleared with the
appropriate department head and the Managing Director before such information is
released, and those releasing such information must have authority delegated to them, in
writing, by the appropriate department head. An employee must obtain permission from
the appropriate department head before filling speaking engagements which involve the
discussion of department business in writing. The release of incorrect information or
misrepresentation of fact may subject the employee to disciplinary action.
G. Information relative to matters of general interest to Bristol Township employees, such as
sickness, accidents and injuries, vacations, retirements, etc., should be obtained from the
Managing Director's office. Further information regarding sick leave reporting and other
policies will be published and distributed to supervision. All requests for information
shall be in writing.
34:14 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 34-22 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 34-22
H. Employees shall thoroughly familiarize themselves with all rules and regulations
pertinent to Bristol Township employees, and in case of doubt, refer inquiries to their
immediate supervisor, respective union or the Managing Director's office.
I. No vacation or compensatory time may be taken without prior approval of the
department head after consultation with the Managing Director.
J. All absences not previously arranged for should be reported to the Bristol Township
Police Department no later than one hour before normal starting time of the shift
involved. Failure to report such an absence without good cause will constitute an
unexcused absence.
K. Retirement. An employee over the age of 70 years shall be separated from Township
employment unless, before his/her 71st birthday, he/she requests and is granted an
extension of service by the Managing Director. An extension of service to any employee
over the age of 70 years shall be made solely by the Managing Director at his/her
discretion, taking into account, among other things, the requirements and financial
condition of the Township and the skill and ability of the employee.
L. Medical leave of absences.
(1) The Township reserves the right to replace an employee on medical leave of
absence with another employee. When the person on leave is ready to return to
work, he/she must contact the Managing Director one month before the expected
time of return. In addition, a physician's written statement approving the return to
work must be submitted. If the employee fails to follow this procedure, he/she will
be considered to have voluntarily terminated his/her employment.
(2) An employee returning from medical leave of absence is not guaranteed that he/she
will return to his/her old job or position. The Township will attempt to reinstate
the employee to his/her previous position, if available, or a similar position that is
available. If the same or similar position is not available, the returning employee
will be assigned to an available position which, in the Managing Director's
opinion, the employee can perform competently. If no position is available, the
employee will be entitled to the next available position which the Township
believes the employee can perform competently.
M. The right is reserved to amend or add to these rules and regulations at any time, at the
discretion of the Managing Director, in order to keep abreast of situations as they change
from time to time. In such cases, the employee union and the Council and Executive will
be advised of the changes prior to implementation. Should the Council and Executive
consider it appropriate to approve such changes, they will be submitted in the form of a
resolution.

any business, service or professional for the purpose of directing the public to patronize a
business, service or professional.

L. All departments and services rendered come under close scrutiny of the public.

industriously at all times. The opinions of people are formed by the manner in which all

§ 34-25. Alcoholism policy.
A. Policy statement.
34:18 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 34-25 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 34-25
(1) Bristol Township recognizes alcoholism as a disease which is treatable.
(2) For the purpose of this policy, alcoholism exists when an employee's consumption
of any alcoholic beverage begins to interfere with job performance.
(3) Bristol Township is not concerned with social or moderate drinking, but does have
a definite concern and responsibility when an employee's alcoholism or drinking
begins to impact on job performance.
(4) The social stigma often associated with alcoholism is inappropriate and is an
impediment to effective treatment. Bristol Township expects that this policy will
encourage self-referral of employees who suspect that they may have alcoholism or
a drinking problem.
(5) This policy is intended to assure that no employee with alcoholism or a drinking
problem will have his or her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized
by a request for help.
(6) The individual's rights to confidentiality and privacy are recognized. The pertinent
information and records of employees with alcoholism will be preserved in the
same manner as all other medical records.
(7) Supervisors should not attempt to diagnose alcoholism. Supervisor-initiated referral
for diagnosis and treatment should be based strictly on unsatisfactory or
deteriorating job performance resulting from app&ent medical or behavioral
problems, whatever their nature.
(8) Employees with alcoholism will receive the same careful consideration and
opportunities for treatment that are presently extended to employees with any other
illness.
(9) It will be the responsibility of the employee to comply with the referral for
diagnosis and to cooperate with the prescribed treatment. An employee's refusal to
accept diagnosis or treatment, or failure to respond to treatment, will be handled in
the same manner as for all other illnesses when job performance continues to be
adversely affected.
(10) Implementation of this policy will not require or result in any special regulation,
privileges or exemptions from the standard administrative practices applicable to
job performance requirements.
B. Purpose and intent of policy. This policy statement reflects Bristol Township's position
on alcoholism. It is further intended to negate informal practices that may exist in
connection with alcoholism, especially those that lead to the cover-up and protection of
the alcoholic. It puts a responsibility on all levels of management to be alert to
unsatisfactory or still acceptable but deteriorating job performance and to follow the
program whenever this occurs.
34:19 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 34-26 BRISTOL CODE § 34-26
§ 34-26. Safety policy.
A. The safety and health of each employee and citizen who comes in contact with the
Township's property, equipment or operation are of vital concern to the Township of
Bristol's elected officials. As public servants dedicated to the well-being of our citizenry,
each of us must pursue the highest standards in our assigned activities. The Township of
Bristol hereby establishes a policy of accident and illness prevention based on awareness
and total participation. This policy obligates the Township with the responsibility of:
(1) Providing safe, healthful working conditions and equipment.
(2) Complying with the standards prescribed by applicable state and local laws.
(3) Conducting operations and services to enhance the safety and health of employees,
residents and visitors.
B. Since the well-being of persons involved in the protection of our physical resources is as
important as the activities or work performed, the Township hereby sets as its goal the
maintenance of a healthy and accident-free environment. The requirements for such a
program shall be based on common sense, accepted practice and the standards required
by federal, state and local authorities.
C. The management responsibility for this policy follows the line authority from the Bristol
Township Council and the Managing Director and then to the department heads,
supervisors and line employees.
D. The following procedures are in effect:
(1) The Managing Director, along with the Safety Council, will develop policies.
(2) The Managing Director, with the consent of the Executive, will appoint a Safety
Council advisory to himself to assist in implementing the Township's safety
program.
(3) The Executive will appoint a Safety Coordinator, as an action agent, to guide the
accident prevention effort.
(4) Necessary directives will be promulgated to make certain that all employees are
aware of this policy, with provisions for regular meetings, training and disciplinary
action as required.

sexually oriented business for the personal safety of patrons and employees and to reduce
the incidence of vandalism and criminal conduct. The lighting shall be shown on the
required sketch or diagram of the premises.
C. The premises within which the adult business is located shall provide sufficient
sound-absorbing insulation so that noise generated inside the premises shall not be
audible anywhere on any adjacent property or public right-of-way or within any other

posted in prominent places in and near the video booths.
K. The floors, seats, walls and other interior portions of all video booths shall be maintained
clean and free from waste and bodily secretions. Presence of human excrement, urine,

adult-oriented establishment.
L. All areas of the adult premises shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures of
sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are permitted access at an

of the alarm user. Should improvements in the system be indicated as a result of the
study or review, the alarm user, at the discretion of the Office of Licenses, Zoning and
Inspections or the Office of the Fire Marshal, must make said improvements. Should the

Zoning and Inspections or the Office of the Fire Marshal as an improvement to reduce
faulty alarms, there shall be a sixty-day moratorium on any penalties for faulty alarms,
and any faulty alarms during that period shall not be counted or considered in applying
the above penalties. This exception shall apply to both public and private alarm users.

funds exclusively to purchase, restore or repair fire-fighting or safety equipment.
[Amended 5-14-1991 by Ord. No. 91-8]
B. To facilitate the keeping of accurate records for the collection of fines and disbursal of
said funds, Fire Departments shall forward to the Chief of Police on a weekly basis a

Statutory Authorization
§ 68-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Council of the Township of Bristol does hereby order as follows.
ARTICLE II
General Provisions
§ 68-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
§ 68-3 BUILDING PERMITS AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT § 68-6
68:3 05-22-2020
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents,
by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 68-3. Applicability.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Township of Bristol unless
a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 68-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions
are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this chapter, the more
restrictive shall apply.
§ 68-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter shall be declared invalid
for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which
shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are hereby
declared to be severable.
§ 68-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that
land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township of Bristol or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions
of this chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain Administrator
shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the performance of any act it
requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may require; provided, however,
that such notice or order shall be deemed to have been properly served upon such
owner or agent when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other method
authorized or required by the laws of this state;
(5) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions
of this chapter.
B. Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or provisions of
this chapter or who fails or refuses to comply with any notice, order of direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality shall be guilty of a summary
offense and upon conviction shall pay a fine to Bristol Township, of not less than $25.00 nor
more than $600.00 plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties all other actions
are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this chapter. The
imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter shall not
excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons shall be required
to correct or remedy such violations and noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development
initiated or any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated,
in noncompliance with this chapter, may be declared by the Council to be a public

§ 68-18. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of Bristol Township classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the flood
insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated March 16,
2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent
revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study; and
B. Any community identified flood hazard areas.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are hereby
adopted by Bristol Township and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 68-19. Description and special requirements of identified floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which
represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order
to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot
at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, or other acceptable means, performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
§ 68-19 BUILDING PERMITS AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT § 68-19
68:11 05-22-2020
in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless
written consent is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection regional
office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the

restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent or more of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred “substantial damage” or “repetitive loss” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local
code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC) — The statewide building code adopted by the Pennsylvania
General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all municipalities whether administered
by the municipality, a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and
the International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard applicable with the
state floodplain construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made specifically
to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VARIANCE — A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation.

Pursuant to the power and authority granted to the franchising authority under the Cable Act
of 1992, its certification by the FCC for regulating rates for the basic service tier, and rates for
the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic service tier, and other charges
which may be regulated by the franchising authority pursuant to the regulations adopted by

power over the rates charged or to be charged to a subscriber for the basic service tier, and for
the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic service tier applicable to those
subscribers of the cable operator(s).
75-4. Rate applications.
A. Initial procedures.
(1) The cable operator(s) shall give notice to its subscribers within 90 days (or three
billing cycles) of the effective date of the rules adopted by the franchising
authority, and all new subscribers at the time of installation, of the availability of
the basic service tier.
75:3 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 BRISTOL CODE § 75-4
(2) Each cable operator shall submit a rate application to the franchising authority for
approval of that cable operator's current rates for the basic service tier and for
approval of its rates for the equipment and installation necessary to receive the
basic service tier, and for approval of any proposed rate increase.
(a) The rate application for approval of current rates for the basic service tier and
the rates for the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic
service tier shall be filed within 30 days of notice from the franchising
authority to the cable operator(s) that the franchising authority has been
certified by the FCC and has adopted the regulations required by the FCC for
rate regulation.
(b) The rate application for any proposed increase in rates for the basic service
tier or for the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic
service tier, other than an annual rate adjustment, shall be filed a minimum of
30 days before the effective date of the proposed increase.
(c) A cable operator that submits for review an annual rate adjustment for the
basic service tier and associated equipment costs shall do so no later than 90
days from the effective date of the proposed rates.
(d) Included in a rate application shall be such information as is set forth in the

basic service tier, and/or in evaluating any proposed rate increase of those
same items.
(0 If the current rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier, or any proposed rate
increase exceeds the maximum permitted rates, the cable operator(s) may
submit a cost-of-service rate application in conformity with FCC rules. Only
the cable operator(s) may decide whether to submit a cost-of-service rate
application.
(3) The cable operator shall give written notice to its subscribers that a rate application
has been filed at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any proposed rate
increase. In the case of an annual rate adjustment rate application, the cable
operator may give subscribers notice of the proposed rate changes at the time a
cable operator files its rates with the franchising authority. Such notice should state
that the proposed rate change is subject to approval by the franchising authority. If
the cable operator is only permitted a smaller increase than was provided for in the
notice, the cable operator must provide an explanation to subscribers on the bill in
which the rate adjustment is implemented. If the cable operator is not permitted to
implement any of the rate increase that was provided for in the notice, the cable
operator must provide an explanation to subscribers within 60 days of the date of
75:4 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 CABLE TELEVISION § 75-4
the franchising authority's opinion. Said notice shall provide the name and address
of the franchising authority before whom the rate application is pending.
(4) The cable operator(s) bears the burden of proof that its current rates or any
proposed rate increase complies with the statutes of the United States and the
regulations of the FCC.
(5) Within 10 days of receipt of a rate application, the franchising authority shall
provide notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the
franchising authority, which notice shall contain at a minimum:
(a) The rate application has been received from the cable operator(s);
(b) The manner in which interested parties may review and/or obtain copies of
the rate application;
(c) The effective date of the proposed rate increase, if that is the subject of the
rate application;
(d) The manner in which interested parties may offer their comments regarding
the rate application;
(e) The date all comments must be received by the franchising authority; and
(f) The date on which the franchising authority must act on the rate application
or the rate application shall have become effective without action.

adjustment, the franchising authority shall:
(a) Review the rate application and documentation submitted by the cable

authority shall have 90 days from the date of the filing to:
[1] Review the rate application and documentation submitted by the cable
operator(s);
[2] Compare the current rates or the proposed rate increase submitted by
the cable operator(s) with the maximum permitted rates or with such
75:5 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 BRISTOL CODE § 75-4
other applicable standards as have been adopted and/or approved by the
FCC.
[3] Consider any public input on the rate application which may have been
provided; and
[4] Approve, disapprove or seek additional time to consider the rate
application.
(b) However, if the franchising authority or its designee concludes that the cable
operator has submitted a facially incomplete filing, the franchising authority's
deadline for issuing an opinion, the date on which rates may go into effect if
no opinion is issued, and the period for which refunds are payable will be
tolled while the franchising authority is waiting for this information, provided
that, in order to toll these effective dates, the franchising authority or its
designee notifies the cable operator of the incomplete filing within 45 days of
the date the filing is made.
(8) Approval of rate application.
(a) If the franchising authority shall fail to either approve, disapprove or seek
additional time to consider the rate application, other than an annual rate
adjustment, within said 30 days, the rate application shall be deemed
approved on the 30th day after submission.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, in the
event the cable operator files an annual rate adjustment, if the franchising
authority has taken no action within the ninety-day review period, then the
proposed rates may go into effect at the end of the review period, subject to a
prospective rate reduction and refund if the franchising authority
subsequently issues an opinion disapproving any portion of such rates;
provided, however, that in order to order a prospective rate reduction and
refund, if the cable operator who made the filing inquires as to whether the
franchising authority intends to issue an opinion after the initial review
period, the franchising authority or its designee must notify the cable operator
of its intent in this regard within 15 days of the cable operator's inquiry. If a
proposed rate goes into effect before the franchising authority issues its
opinion, the franchising authority shall have 12 months from the date the
cable operator filed for the rate adjustment to issue its opinion. In the event
that the franchising authority does not act within this twelve-month period, it
may not at a later date order a refund or a prospective rate reduction with
respect to that rate filing.
B. Request for additional time.
(1) Rate application. If the franchising authority is unable to determine from the rate
application, including any supporting documentation submitted by the cable
operator(s), whether the current rates for the basic service tier and/or for the
equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic service tier and/or the
proposed rate increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising
75:6 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 CABLE TELEVISION § 75-4
authority may, in cases not involving an annual rate adjustment or cost-of-service
showings, take an additional 90 days to consider the rate application.
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the same upon the
cable operator(s) indicating that additional time is required to consider the
rate application. The order shall be issued prior to the expiration of the 30
days during which the franchising authority may consider the rate
application. Within seven days of issuance of such order, the franchising
authority shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the
jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice shall contain a
summary of the order, including the additional time requested, and the reason
for requesting such additional time.
(b) The cable operator may submit such additional information as it believes will
cure any deficiencies in the rate application during the additional time.
(c) The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to furnish
additional specified information, including proprietary information, when the
current rate or proposed rate increase is in excess of the maximum permitted
rate. When the current rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate,
the franchising authority may only require furnishing of documentation that
the rate is within the maximum permitted rate. Any proprietary information
furnished to the franchising authority shall be retained as confidential in
conformity with regulations adopted by the FCC in this regard, a copy of
which regulations are on file with and available for review upon request to
the franchising authority.
(d) If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the expiration of the
additional time, the current rates or proposed rate increase shall become
effective, subject to any later refund order adopted by the franchising
authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchising authority, in order
to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order, direct the cable
operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of
the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
(2) Cost-of-service rate application. If the cable operator(s) has submitted a
cost-of-service rate application and the franchising authority is unable to determine
whether the current rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier and/or the proposed rate
increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising authority may
take an additional 150 days to consider the cost-of-service rate application.
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the same upon the
cable operator(s) indicating that additional time is required to consider the
rate application because it is a cost-of-service rate application. The order
shall be issued prior to the expiration of the 30 days during which the
franchising authority may consider the rate application. Within seven days of
issuance of such order, the franchising authority shall publish notice in a
newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the franchising
75:7 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 BRISTOL CODE § 75-4
authority, which notice shall contain a summary of the order, including the
additional time requested, and the reason for requesting such additional time.
(b) The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to furnish
additional specified information, including proprietary information, when the
current rate or proposed rate increase is in excess of the maximum permitted
rate. When the current rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate,
the franchising authority may only require furnishing of documentation that
the rate is within the maximum permitted rate. Any proprietary information
furnished to the franchising authority shall be retained as confidential in
conformity with regulations adopted by the FCC in this regard, a copy of
which regulations are on file with and available for review upon request to
the franchising authority.
(c) If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the expiration of the
additional time, the current rates or proposed rate increase shall become
effective, subject to any later refund order adopted by the franchising
authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchising authority, in order
to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order, direct the cable
operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of
the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
C. Decision of the franchising authority.
(1) The franchising authority shall issue a written opinion when:
(a) The rate application is not approved, in whole or in part, by the franchising
authority;
(b) The rate application is approved by the franchising authority over the
objection(s) of any interested party.
(2) The franchising authority may but is not required to issue a written opinion when
the rate application is approved and there have been no objections filed.
(3) Within seven days of issuance of an opinion, the franchising authority shall
provide notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the
franchising authority, which notice shall contain at a minimum that:
(a) The franchising authority has reached a decision on the rate application, and
announcing that decision;
(b) The manner in which interested parties may review and/or obtain copies of
the opinion;
(c) The right of interested parties to take an appeal from the opinion of the
franchising authority; and

(4) Notice of the opinion of the franchising authority shall be provided to the cable
operator(s) by mail within seven days of issuance.
75:8 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 CABLE TELEVISION § 75-4
D. Disapproval of the rate application.
(1) Rate reduction.
(a) Current rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an opinion disapproving
the current rates of the cable operator(s) for the basic service tier or for rates
for the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic service tier,
the franchising authority may order a reduction in the current rates for the
basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation necessary to
receive the basic service tier. The prospective rate adjustment may be set at:
[1] A level consistent with the FCC adopted maximum permitted rates;
[2] Another rate, based on review of a cost-of-service rate application; or
[3] Another rate consistent with FCC rules.
(b) Proposed rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an opinion
disapproving of any proposed rate increase, the franchising authority may:
[1] Prescribe a reasonable rate to be charged by the cable operator(s)
instead of the proposed rate. The prescribed rate may not be lower than
the maximum permitted rate unless a cost-of-service rate application has
been submitted by the cable operator(s) and the franchising authority
determines that the cost-of-service analysis justifies a lower rate; or
[2] Advise the cable operator(s) of a rate level to which it would not object
if a modified rate application were resubmitted.
(2) Refunds. The franchising authority may order a refund if:
(a) The cable operator failed to comply with a rate decision by the franchising
authority. The refund period may be retroactive to the effective date of the
rate order issued by the franchising authority.
(b) The franchising authority determines in its initial review of the current rates
that they exceed the maximum permitted rates and are unsupported by a
cost-of-service rate application. In such instance the refund period may be
retroactive to September 1, 1993, or one year prior to the date on which the
cable operator(s) implement(s) the prospective rate adjustment, whichever is
shorter.
(c) The franchising authority: [1] has issued an order permitting it to take an
additional 90 or 150 days to consider a rate application; and [2] has directed
the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by
reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid; but
[3] failed to issue an opinion during that time period, causing the rates to
become provisionally effective, and the franchising authority later finds all or
a portion of the rates to be unreasonable. In such instance, the refund period
may be retroactive to the date of the order and ending on the date on which
75:9 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 75-4 BRISTOL CODE § 75-6
the cable operator(s) implements the prospective rate reduction, or one year,
whichever is shorter.
(3) Before any refund order shall become effective, the franchising authority must
send notice to the cable operator(s), and provide said cable operator(s) a maximum
of 30 days to submit additional information to the franchising authority as to why
the refund should not be ordered. At the end of said period, the franchising
authority shall either confirm, amend or rescind said refund order.
(4) Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the
Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments.
(5) If any proposed rate increase has gone into effect due to inaction of the franchising
authority or the failure of the franchising authority to issue an order stating a need
for additional time, the franchising authority has no right to order a refund.
(6) Any violation of any order issued hereunder shall be considered a violation of this
article.
§ 75-5. Enforcement.
A. Cumulative remedies. Where this article provides alternative penalties or remedies, they
shall be cumulative, and the imposition of one penalty or remedy shall not prevent the
franchising authority from invoking any other penalty or remedy provided herein.
B. In addition to all other rights and remedies provided herein, the franchising authority
shall have all rights and remedies afforded under the franchise agreement.
C. Unless otherwise provided, any person convicted of violating any provision of this
article, including any order issued or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, shall,
upon conviction, be fined not more than $600 and costs for each offense, and in default
of payment thereof may be imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day of a
continuing violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
§ 75-6. Ratemaking appeals.
Appeals of all ratemaking decisions by the franchising authority may be taken to the FCC by
the cable operator(s), subscribers, or other interested parties.
A. Appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date of public release of the franchising
authority's opinion.
B. Opposition to an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the filing of the appeal and
must be served on the party appealing.

Nighttime Curfew
[Adopted 10-20-1992 by Ord. No. 92-17]
§ 87-1. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Curfew Ordinance."
§ 87-2. Purpose and findings.
A. This article prescribes, in accordance with prevailing community standards, regulations
for the conduct of minors on streets at night, effectively enforced, taught in the homes,
internalized and adhered to for generations, all for the good of minors, for the furtherance
of family responsibility and for the public good, safety and welfare.
B. The Township Council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need and has been,
over the years, a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be
updated and amplified in the light of Bristol's local situation and facts. The curfew hours
declared by this article take into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime and
for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity.
87:1 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-2 BRISTOL CODE § 87-3
C. Bristol is a stable family community. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of
children is the norm; legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a
demonstrated effectiveness over the years; as parental control increases, the likelihood of
juvenile delinquency decreases; and there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew
for minors, which has achieved and will continue to achieve, under local conditions, the
purposes hereinbefore stated.
§ 87-3. Definitions and word usage.
A. For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations
shall have the meanings given herein:
MINOR — Any person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing often herein
employed, any person 17 or fewer years of age.
PARENT — Any person having legal custody of a minor:
(1) As a natural or adoptive parent;
(2) As a legal guardian;
(3) As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
(4) As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court.
REMAIN — To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets,
including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or
more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for
ordinary or serious purposes, such as mere passage or going home. To implement
that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are
expressly defined in § 87-5. More and more exceptions become available with
increasing years as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is
intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain" found constitutional in
Baker v. Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauph. 17(1912).
STREET — A way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian
travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited
to the cartway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved,
and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street.
The term "street" also applies, for curfew purposes, to ways the public is privileged
to use over private property so long as the owner permits, including sidewalks and
grass plots similarly open at the time to public use, and to parking areas of any
type (residential, municipal or commercial) open to public use or from such street
or any type of street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what it is called or
formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise, or whether it is
maintained by the Township and irrespective of whether it is open to the use of the
public as a matter of right.
87:2 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-3 CURFEW § 87-5
TIME OF NIGHT — Based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern
standard time or Eastern daylight saving time, generally observed at that hour by
the public in the Township, prima facie the time then observed in the Township
administrative offices and police station.
TOWNSHIP — The Township of Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
YEAR OF AGE — Continues from one birthday, such as the 17th, to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear that 17 or
fewer years of age is hereby treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of
age," the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of
persons into the mistaken thought that eighteen-year-olds might be involved.
Similarly, for example, 11 or fewer years of age means "under 12 years of age."
B. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words in the plural number include the singular, and words in the singular number
include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
§ 87-4. Curfew for minors established.
It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or fewer years of age (under 18) to be or remain in or
upon the streets within the Township of Bristol at night during the period ending at 6:00 a.m.
and beginning:
A. At 10:00 p.m. for minors 11 or fewer years of age.
B. At 10:30 p.m. for minors 12 or 13 years of age.
C. At 11:00 p.m. for minors 14 or more years of age.
§ 87-5. Exceptions.
A. In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a street within the Township during the
nocturnal hours for which § 87-4 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation
(and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their fellow citizens) shall not,
however, be considered in violation of this article:
(1) When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
(2) When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said
parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and
purpose within a specified area.
(3) When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right
of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first
delivering to the Managing Director a written communication, signed by such
minor and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of such minor, with their home
address and telephone number, specifying when, where and in what manner said
minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when this article is otherwise
87:3 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-5 BRISTOL CODE § 87-5
applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in
such communication.
(4) In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has
communicated to the Township police station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity, relating to specified streets at a designated time for a
described purpose, including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication or of the police record thereof duly certified by the Chief of Police
to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the
names and address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
(5) When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides or on the
sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the
police officer.
(6) When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of the
termination of) a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary
association of which prior notice, indicating the place and probable time of
termination, has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by
the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station,
thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional situations) conduct on the part of
minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat
conflicting interests.
(7) When authorized by special permit from the Managing Director, carried on the
person of the minor thus authorized, as follows: When necessary nighttime
activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this
article, then recourse may be had to the Managing Director either for a regulation
as provided in Subsection A(8) or for a special permit, as the circumstances
warrant. Upon the Managing Director's finding of necessity for the use of the
streets to the extent warranted by a written application (as judicially approved in
People v. Walton, 161 P. 2d 498, 502 - 503, Cal. App. 1945), signed by a minor
and by a parent of such minor, if feasible, stating the name, age and address of
such minor; the name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof; the
height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of
such minor; the necessity which requires such minor to remain upon the streets
during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; and the street or route and the
beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour, the
Managing Director may grant a permit, in writing, for the use by such minor of
such streets at such hours as, in the Managing Director's opinion, may reasonably
be necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone or other effective
communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously,
either to the Managing Director or, if unavailable, to the police officer authorized
by the Managing Director to act on his behalf in an emergency at the police
station.
(8) When authorized by regulation issued by the Managing Director in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime
activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special
87:4 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-5 CURFEW § 87-6
permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Managing Director permitting use of
the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
through news media and through other agencies, such as the schools, and shall
define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time
involved, not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of
such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably
necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article.
(9) When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar
month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more than 45 days
previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly identifying the minor, the
addresses of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of
employment.
(10) When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This contemplates
normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona fide interstate
movement through Bristol. This also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending
in Bristol.
(11) When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Managing Director shall have
determined, by formal rule first reported to the Township Council spread upon its
minutes and so reported in the press, finding the facts as to the extent (minimal) of
juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule, currently, in the best
interest of said minors and of the Township, then the Managing Director, by such
formal rule, covering a period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof,
not exceeding one year from the date thereof, may take appropriate action
excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or area or all minors (as
the current facts may warrant) 17 years of age at the date or attaining 17 years of
age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect.
B. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as provisions for
notification, is severable, as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized; and additional,
also severable, exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors
enrolled respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by
the Township Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of
student government associations; school personnel; citizens; associations; ward, precinct
and neighborhood spokesmen; parents; officers; and persons in authority concerned
positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
87-6. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by
inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any street within the Township
under circumstances not constituting an exception to or otherwise beyond the scope of this
article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is
intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community
standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
87:5 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-6 BRISTOL CODE § 87-8
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
minor.
§ 87-7. Police procedures.
A. A policeman of the Township, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on
the streets in prima facie violation of this article, normally shall take the minor to the
Township police station, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such
minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment,
under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the
Sergeant there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform
enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the
best of facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing
evidence, such as a birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his best judgment in determining age.
B. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide,
inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate
circumstances, for example, a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address
may readily be ascertained or are known.
C. In any event, such policeman shall, within 24 hours, file a written report with the Chief
of Police or shall participate, to the extent of the information for which he is responsible,
in the preparation, by himself and the Sergeant involved in such case, and in the filing of
such report within 24 hours.
D. When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor and the
appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of
such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the minor, then the
minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance
with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on behalf of a
parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or
arrival of a parent.
E. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall, by certified mail,
send to a parent written notice of said violation, with a warning that any subsequent
violation will result in full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of parental
responsibility and of applicable penalties.
§ 87-8. Violations and penalties.
Prevailing community standards and the real internalization thereof or interpersonal sanctions
therefor that, in practice, count for much, as to when minors should be off the streets,
reflected in this article, are hereby undergirded with the following legal sanctions:
A. If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 87-7 of a first violation by a minor, a parent
violates § 87-6 (in connection with a second violation by said minor), this shall be treated
87:6 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-8 CURFEW § 87-10
as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a parent shall be fined
$25, and for each subsequent offense by a parent, the fine shall be increased by an
additional $25 (e.g., $50 for the second, $75 for the third offense). The District Justice,
upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of
prosecution and, upon refusal to pay such fine and costs, to be imprisoned in the jail of
Bucks County for a period not exceeding 30 days.
B. Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this article more than three times
shall be reported by the Managing Director to a society or organization whose purpose it
is to take charge of incorrigibles and delinquents, and proceedings shall then be taken,
under the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 et seq., before the Juvenile Court for the
treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
C. A like procedure before the juvenile authorities shall be followed in any case where the
imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be effective or where, for any other
reason, the provisions of this article cannot be made effective by the imposing of
penalties under this section.
87-9. Construal of provisions.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this article. If any provision,
including, inter alia, any exception, part, phrase or term or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance, is held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall
not be affected thereby, and the validity of this article in any and all other respects shall not
be affected thereby. From excess of caution, the Managing Director is authorized to give
advisory opinions, in writing or immediately reduced to writing, which shall be binding and
shall be adhered to by the police until the chapter is amended in such respect, interpreting
terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions shall be in response
to good faith, signed letters, addressed to him at the Township's administration building,
questioning as ambiguous, as having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked or as otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to proposed
conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to
presenting to any court a question in any of said three categories. The Township Council does
not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. It is intended that
this article be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given. The Township
Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or
the Constitution of the United States of America.
§ 87-10. Continuing evaluation.
The Township Council will continue its evaluation and updating of this article.
A. Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to the Township Council
through effective channels all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the
notices of school and other activities, the Managing Director's special permits and the
Managing Director's regulations hereinbefore authorized, and the Managing Director's
87:7 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 87-10 BRISTOL CODE § 87-11
advisory opinions, for consideration by the appropriate committee and by the Township
Council in further updating and continuing evaluation of this article.
B. For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these legal aspects of the
basic purposes hereof, the Managing Director and relevant committees of the Township
Council, through their respective Chairmen, in coordinated efforts, shall work with
existing and may organize voluntary groups and shall stimulate volunteer leadership in
programs of research and of action dealing constructively, on neighborhood and local
bases, with juvenile delinquency and the prevention, control or containment thereof in all
its ramifications and with practicable steps toward the good life and a better life for
minors 17 or fewer years of age and with the working of this article community-wide
and in individual cases, as one much-needed legal tool toward that end as well as for
continuing present protection of minors and of other persons and of property and other
interests important to the welfare of the people of the Township of Bristol.

entity to change, grade or in any way alter any land, property or real estate located in Bristol

The Managing Director or such official’s designee is hereby appointed as the designated officer
who is authorized to carry out all responsibilities and duties stated herein.
§ 106-23. Restriction on payment for casualty losses.
A. No insurance company, association of exchange (hereinafter “insuring agent”) doing
business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire
damage to a structure located within the Township of Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania
(“Municipality”) where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
106:10 12 - 19 - 2013
§ 106-23 FIRE PREVENTION § 106-24
policies exceeds $7,500, unless the named insured or insuring agent is furnished by the
Manager Director of the Municipality with a certificate pursuant to § 508(b) of the
Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended by Act 98 of 1992 and Act 93 of 1994
(collectively the “Act”) and unless there is compliance with the procedures set forth in §
508(c) and 508(d) of the Act.
B. Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against the
property (“municipal claim”), or there are expenses which the Municipality has incurred as
costs for removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property
(collectively “municipal expenses”) the Managing Director of the Township shall immediately
render a bill for such work, if not already done. Upon written request of the named
insured or insuring agent specifying the description of the property, the name and address
of the insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim, the
Managing Director of the Township shall furnish a certificate within 14 days after the
request of the insurer either:
(1) Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal expenses against the
property.
(2) Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses, accompanied by a bill for
such amounts.
Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed delinquent for this purpose
if a lien could have been filed for such claims under applicable law. Upon receipt of a
certificate and bill pursuant to Subsections A and B of this section, the insuring agent shall
transfer to the Managing Director of the Township an amount from the insurance proceeds
sufficient to pay said sums prior to making payment to the named insured, subject to the
provisions of § 106-24.
§ 106-24. Establishment of escrow.
Where pursuant to § 106-23 the Managing Director issues a certificate indicating that there are
no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against real property or the
Managing Director issues a certificate and bill for such charges and the bill is paid directly by
the insuring agent from the insurance proceeds, the insuring agent shall pay the claim of the
named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed to by the named insured and the
insuring agent equals or exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies
covering the building or other structure, the following procedures must be followed:
A. The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the designated officer of
the Municipality in the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000, and for each fraction of that
amount, of a claim, this section to be applied such that if the claim is $15,000 or less, the
amount transferred to the Municipality shall be $2,000.
B. If at the time of a loss report, the named insured has submitted a contractor’s signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure in
an amount less than the amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the
insuring agent shall transfer to the Municipality from the insurance proceeds the amount
specified in the estimate. If there is more than one insuring agent, the transfer of proceeds
shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges insuring the
building or other structure.
106:11 12 - 19 - 2013
§ 106-24 BRISTOL CODE § 106-25
C. After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs
of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, and the designated officer
shall return the amount of the funds transferred to the Municipality in excess of the
estimate to the named insured, if the Municipality has not commenced to remove, repair or
secure the building or other structure.
D. Upon receipt of the proceeds under this section, the Municipality shall do the following:
(1) The Managing Director shall place the proceeds in the separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or
structure which are incurred by the Municipality. Such costs shall include, without
limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Municipality
in connection with such removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceedings
related thereto.
(2) It is the obligation of the insuring agent when transferring the proceeds to provide the
Municipality with the name and address of the named insured. Upon receipt of the
transferred funds and the name and address of the named insured, the designated
officer shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received
by the Municipality and notify the named insured that the procedures under this
subsection shall be followed.
(3) When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been
completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of the Municipality
and the required proof of such completion received by the designated officer, and if the
Municipality has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall
be returned to the named insured. If the Municipality has incurred costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund and if excess funds remain, the Municipality shall transfer the remaining funds
to the named insured.
(4) To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the Municipality pursuant to
this section, and not returned to the named insured, such interest shall belong to the
Municipality. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest
earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the
proceeds are returned.
E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the Municipality to recover
any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
Municipality and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the
transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.
§ 106-25. Regulations.
The Council for the Township of Bristol may adopt procedures and regulations to implement Act
98 of 1992, as amended, and this Article and may fix reasonable fees to be charged for municipal

Justice, stating by affidavit that he has been refused entry and that he has reason to
believe based upon complaint that a violation of this chapter exists or that, pursuant to
the authority under this section, he is conducting an inspection, examination or survey at
this time because of a lapse of time since the last official inspection, examination or
survey or because of the condition of the area in which is located the particular property
to be inspected, examined or surveyed, provided that nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the entry of the Building Official or his duly authorized
representatives at any time when an actual emergency exists which may involve potential
danger to life or severe property damage.

Curfew — See Ch. 87. Graffiti — See Ch. 110.
127-1. Purposes and findings.
A. The Township Council finds that there is a very real local need to regulate loitering and
other disorderly practices and that there will be a significant factor in minimizing
loitering and other disorderly practices within the Township and should continue to be
updated and amplified in light of Bristol Township's local situation and facts.
B. Bristol Township is a stable family community. Individual responsibility for peaceful and
lawful activity is the norm; legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a
demonstrated effectiveness over the years; as individual responsibility increases, the
likelihood of loitering and disorderly practices decreases; and there is a need for a
prohibition against loitering and disorderly practices which will achieve and will continue
to achieve the public good, safety and welfare.
§ 127-2. Prohibited acts; definitions.
A. Loitering. A person is guilty of loitering if he, alone or with other persons, gathers for an
unlawful or malicious purpose upon any public property or public right-of-way or around
a dwelling, house or any other place used wholly or in part for living or dwelling
purposes belonging to or occupied by another. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, loitering for purposes of this chapter specifically includes any of
the following:
(1) Sleeping in a public place or on public property not intended for such purpose and
without emergency;
(2) Gambling on any public property; or
(3) The gathering or congregation of two or more persons without a permit where such
permit is lawfully required by another chapter of this Code, state statute or federal
law.
127:1 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 127-2 BRISTOL CODE § 127-4
B. Disorderly conduct. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause a
public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he does
any of the following:
(1) Encourages, aids, abets or engages in fighting or threatening or in violent or
tumultuous behavior;
(2) Makes unreasonable or unseemly noise so as to disturb peaceable residents;
(3) Uses obscene language or makes an obscene gesture; or
(4) Creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no
legitimate purpose of the actor.
C. Public. As used in this section, the word "public" means affecting or likely to affect
persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access; among the
places included are highways, transport facilities, schools, prisons, apartment houses,
places of business or amusement, any neighborhood or any premises which are open to
the public.
§ 127-3. Violations and penalties.
A. Any person who shall violate § 127-2A of this chapter or who shall aid, assist, encourage
or abet any other person or persons in the commission of any of the acts prohibited by
this chapter shall be guilty of a summary offense and, upon conviction thereof, may be
required to pay a fine of up to $300 and, in default of payment of such fine and costs as
may be imposed, shall be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of time not to exceed
30 days, provided that in any prosecutions upon any act prohibited by this chapter which
can also be prosecuted under any provision of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the penalty shall not exceed that sum provided for under the state statute.
B. Citations issued under this chapter shall specify the section and the time, date and place
of the offense and sufficiently describe the offending conduct.
§ 127-4. Summary offense.
An offense under this chapter is a summary offense if the actor causes substantial harm or
serious inconvenience or if he persists in loitering or disorderly conduct as those terms are
defined herein after reasonable warning or request to desist.

§ 154-1. Legislative findings.
The General Assembly finds that in municipalities throughout the commonwealth many owners
of properties are using such properties in violation of the zoning ordinances and regulations of
such municipalities and are maintaining such properties in violation of housing, building, safety
and fire ordinances and regulations and are offering such properties for sale without revealing
such illegal use or the receipt of notice of the existence of the nature of violations until they have
entered into agreements of sale or have consummated the purchase.
§ 154-2. Responsibilities of seller.
A. In order to prevent undue hardships and losses imposed on such innocent purchasers by
owners who have failed to reveal the illegal use of the property being conveyed or who have
made misrepresentations in that regard, all sellers of property or their agents shall be
required to advise the purchaser of the legal use of such property and to deliver to the
purchaser not later than at the settlement held for such property a use registration permit
showing the legal use and zoning classification for such property.
B. In order to prevent undue hardship and losses imposed on an innocent purchaser by an
owner who has failed to disclose to a prospective purchaser of property that a notice has
been received that such property is in violation of any and all Township ordinances or
regulations, all sellers of property or their agents shall be required to advise purchasers of
any notice received by the owners of any violation of any housing, building, safety or fire
ordinance or regulation with respect to the property to be sold. [Amended 10-20-1992 by

and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting
period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
§ 160-56 of this article.
B. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
C. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in
§ 160-70.4 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
§ 160-69. Reports of changed conditions.

discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug
load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the
Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
160:37 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-70 BRISTOL CODE § 160-70.4
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in
Subsection A above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
§ 160-70.1. Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
§ 160-70.2. Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting.

within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling
and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days
after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
Superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least once a month or if the Superintendent
samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling.
§ 160-70.3. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater
discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with
procedures approved by the EPA.
§ 160-70.4. Sample collection.
A. Except as indicated in Subsection B below, the user must collect wastewater samples
using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event that flow
proportional sampling is unfeasible, the Superintendent may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates
that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge
limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile
organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain and make available for
inspection and copying all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses;
the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Bristol Township
Authority or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.
§ 160-70.7. Right of entry; inspection and sampling.
The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether
the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with
its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Superintendent
will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
B. The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require the
installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the
user's operations.

§ 160-70.7 BRISTOL CODE § 160-70.10
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the user's premises shall be
a violation of this article.
§ 160-70.8. Search warrants.
If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part
thereof and is able to demonstrate structure or property or any part thereof and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the Bristol Township Authority designed to verify compliance with this article or any
permit or order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of
the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Court
of Common Pleas of Bucks County.
§ 160-70.9. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information
should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40
CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
§ 160-70.10. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the
municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66% or
more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily
maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount.
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33% or more
of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month
period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit
160:40 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-70.10 SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL § 160-70.12
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH).
C. Any other discharge violation that the Superintendent believes has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering
the health of POTW personnel or the general public.
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to
the environment or has resulted in the Superintendent's exercise of his emergency
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone
contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting
construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance.
F. Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including
baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with Categorical Pretreatment
Standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules.
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
H. Any other violation(s) which the Superintendent determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
§ 160-70.11. Notification of violation.
When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision
of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within 20 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Superintendent to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a notice of violation.
160-70.12. Consent orders.
The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct
the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall
have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 160-70.14
and 160-70.15 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

160-70.13. Show-cause hearing.
The Superintendent may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any provision
of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the Superintendent and show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may
be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show-cause hearing shall not be a
bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
160-70.14. Compliance orders.
When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision
of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified
time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and • management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against
or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
160-70.15. Cease-and-desist orders.
A. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements.
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatening violation, including halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking
any other action against the user.

A. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine such user in an
amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an
additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a
rate of 1% per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Superintendent to
reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 20 days of being
notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Superintendent may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event that the user's appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The
Superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such
as notices and orders, to the fine and also deduct said costs from fine payments to be
returned as a result of successful appeal.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking
any other action against the user.
160-70.17. Emergency suspensions.
A. The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to
the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with
the operation of the POTW or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
(1) Any user notified or a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream or endangerment
to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
§ 160-70.18 of this article are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
160:43 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-70.17 BRISTOL CODE § 160-70.20
occurrences, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any show-cause or
termination hearing under § 160-70.13 or 160-70.18 of this article.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this section.
160-70.18. Termination of discharge.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 160-63 of this article, any user who violates the
following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge.
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume,
constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring or sampling.
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 160-44 through 160-48 of this article.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under § 160-70.13 of this article why the proposed action
should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to or
a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
160-70.19. Injunctive relief.
When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision
of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Court of Common
Pleas of Bucks County, through the Bristol Township Authority's attorney, for the issuance of
a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit order or other requirement imposed by this
article on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
160-70.20. Civil penalties.
A. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be liable to the Bristol Township Authority for a maximum civil
penalty of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term
160:44 06 -15 - 2005
§ 160-70.20 SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL § 160-70.22
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
B. The Bristol Township Authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Bristol Township Authority.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including but not limited to the extent of harm caused by the violation,
the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any
other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any
other action against a user.
§ 160-70.21. Criminal prosecution; violations and penalties.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a summary offense, punishable by a fine
of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90
days, or both.
B. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which
causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a summary
offense and be subject to a penalty of at least $5,000 or be subject to imprisonment for
not more than 180 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of
action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.

more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 120 days, or
both.
§ 160-70.22. Remedies to be nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any,
all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Bristol Township Authority's
Enforcement Response Plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any
user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

§ 160-70.23 BRISTOL CODE § 160-70.26
§ 160-70.23. Performance bonds.
The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Bristol Township Authority, in a sum
not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
§ 160-70.24. Liability insurance.
The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 160-70.25. Informant rewards.
The Bristol Township Authority may pay up to $100 for information leading to the discovery
of noncompliance by a user. In the event that the information provided results in a civil
penalty or an administrative fine levied against the user, the Bristol Township authority may
disperse up to 5% of the collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a single reward
payment may not exceed $1,000.
§ 160-70.26. Variances.
A. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in these regulations, a special variance or
amendment may be issued whereby a waste of unusual character or strength may be
accepted, when in the opinion of the Bristol Township Authority, unusual or
extraordinary circumstances compel special terms or special conditions. As a separate
and additional requirement, such variance or amendment will be issued only when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, it would not have any deleterious effect on the system by
causing interference with or disruption in the treatment works or violation of NPDES
permit or state water quality criteria or standards. In no case shall a discharge be
approved which would exceed the limits established by a National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard.
B. A user seeking a variance or amendment shall petition the Bristol Township Authority in
writing and provide documentation of the exceptional circumstances which the user
believes would justify a variance or amendment. If a variance or amendment is approved
by the Bristol Township Authority, the user shall pay a surcharge in addition to the
applicable volume charges. Said surcharge shall be established by the Bristol Township
Authority for each variance or amendment granted.

(2) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which
will pass through the system inadequately treated into receiving waters or the
atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
(3) Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the
system.
(4) Provide for equitable distribution of the cost for the implementation of the
Authority's industrial pretreatment program.
C. This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal
wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nonresidential users and
through enforcement of general requirements for the other nonresidential users;
160:47 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-71 BRISTOL CODE § 160-74

operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all users of a
POTW, whether or not the user is subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
or any other federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user or
significant user may not contribute the following substances to the POTW:
(1) Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are or may
be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or
explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the
POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at
the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than
5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the
meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: gasoline, kerosene,
naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides,
chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other
substance which is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.
(2) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or
other interferences with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, such
as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than 1/2 inch in any
dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings,
entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble
dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops,
wastepaper, wood, plastic, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
(3) Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or greater than 9.0, unless the POTW is
specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structure,
equipment and/or personnel of the POTW.
(4) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants which, either singly or by interaction
with other pollutants, are in sufficient quantity to injure or interfere with any
wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans and animals, create a
toxic effect in the receiving waters or the POTW or exceed the limitations set forth
160:53 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-75 BRISTOL CODE § 160-75
in a Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but
not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
(5) Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to
life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair.
(6) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the
POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation or
reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use
or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the
Act or any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the sludge management
method being used.
Any substance which will pass through and as a result cause the POTW to violate
its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards.
Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process,
such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the
POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a
temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40° C. (104° F.),
unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature.
(10) Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a
flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which causes interference to the POTW. In
no case shall a waste load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or qualities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than five
times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal
operation, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Authority.
(11) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Authority in compliance
with applicable state or federal regulations.
(12) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance.
(13) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, cooling water, unpolluted industrial
or nonresidential process water. The discharge of cooling water from
air-conditioning units with cooling towers or recirculating systems or from
air-conditioning units using flow-through or unrecirculating systems is prohibited.
The sanitary sewers are not designed to handle the cooling water volumes

B. When the Authority determines that a user or significant user is contributing to the
POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the Authority shall advise the user of the impact of the
contribution on the POTW and develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
C. Grease, oil or sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Authority,
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in
such amounts as to cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the
operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients, except such interceptors shall not be required for private living
quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Authority and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for
the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which are subject to review by the
Authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the
owner's (owners') personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal
firms.
160-76. Effect of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Upon promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard under Section 307 of the
Clean Water Act for a particular industrial subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under the Authority's rates, rules and regulations for
sources in that subcategory, shall supersede the limitations imposed by the Authority. The
Authority shall notify all affected significant users of the applicable reporting requirements
under 40 CFR 403.12.
160-77. Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Where the Authority's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants
limited by Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the Authority may apply to the
approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the reduction in the amount of a pollutant or
alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or
harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken
when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2). The Authority
may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the
approval authority is obtained.
§ 160-78. Specific pollutant limitations.
The Authority reserves the right to impose specific pollutant limitations in its rates, rules and
regulations.

The Authority reserves the right to establish in its rates, rules and regulations more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater treatment system if deemed
necessary and appropriate to comply with the objectives presented in § 160-71 of this article.
§ 160-81. Prohibited treatments to achieve compliance.
No user or significant user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the Authority or state.
160-82. Accidental discharges.
A. Each user or significant user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Authority for review and
shall be approved by the Authority before construction of the facility. All existing users
and significant users shall complete such a plan when designated by the Authority. No
user or significant user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective
date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until the
accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the Authority. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user or significant
user from the responsibility to modify its facility, as necessary, to meet the requirements
of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user or
significant user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume
and corrective actions.
B. Written report. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user or significant
user shall submit to the Authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user or significant user to mitigate and
prevent any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW or aquatic life or any other damages to person or property. Such
report shall not relieve the user or significant user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. This written report
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user or significant user.
160:56 06 - 15 - 2005

applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if
160:61 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 160-93 BRISTOL CODE § 160-94
not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user and certified to by a
qualified professional.
160-94. Periodic reports.
A. Any user subject to a pretreatment standard after the compliance date of such
pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily
flow allowed in the wastewater discharge permit. If sampling by the user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation,
except if the POTW performs sampling at least once per month at the user's facility or if
the POTW performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time the user receives the results of this sampling.
At the discretion of the Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high and
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Authority may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted. This report shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the user.
B. The Authority may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by Subsection A of
this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in
the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis
of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and
mass where requested by the Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited
by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as
prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard or by the Authority. All analyses shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established by 40 CFR 136 and amendments
thereto or with any other test procedures approved by EPA. Sampling shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. (Comment: Where 40 CFR 136
does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by EPA.)

A. The Authority shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of building
sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the Authority may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in
the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate.
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all ties in a safe and proper operating condition at the
expense of the user.

permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agencies without restriction unless the user specifically requests and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection to the
public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for
uses related to this article, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or
any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.
C. Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall be transmitted to any
governmental agency immediately when requested, but not to the general public unless a
ten-day notification is given to the user by the Authority.
§ 160-99. Suspension of service or permit.
A. The Authority may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater
discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Authority, in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
B. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the
wastewater discharge permits shall immediately stop or eliminate the wastewater
discharge to the POTW. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with

173:3 05-22-2020
public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and
redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the
natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat and
elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including reasonable regulation
of development and activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the
Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Through project design, impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized to maintain the natural
hydrologic regime, and sustain high water quality, groundwater recharge, stream base flow,
and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage
stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project design, minimizing impervious surfaces
and sprawl, avoiding sensitive areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and considering
topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully
addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
H. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution
of waters of the Commonwealth by the municipality.

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management
§ 173-9. Requirements applicable to all stormwater management systems.
A. All regulated activities in Delaware River South Watershed that do not fall under the exemption
criteria shown in § 173-21 shall submit a drainage plan consistent with the Delaware River South
Watershed stormwater management plan to the municipality for review. This criteria shall apply
to the total proposed development even if development is to take place in stages. Impervious
cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new streets
and sidewalks. Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be
impervious for the exemption criteria.
B. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit unimpeded flow along natural
watercourses, except as modified by stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent
with this chapter.
C. The drainage plan must be designed consistent with the sequencing provisions of § 173-10 to
ensure maintenance of the natural hydrologic regime and to promote groundwater recharge and
protect groundwater and surface water quality and quantity. The drainage plan designer must proceed
sequentially in accordance with this article.
D. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent property shall not be
altered without permission of the affected property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
E. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria
in the general direction of existing discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained
as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed
to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the applicant must document
that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated dis§
173-9 BRISTOL CODE § 173-9
05-22-2020 173:18
charge, or otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result
from the concentrated discharge.
F. Whenever a watercourse is located within a development site, it shall remain open in its natural
state and location and should not be piped, impeded, or altered (except for road crossings). It is
the responsibility of the developer to stabilize existing eroded stream/channel banks.
G. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage easements shall be provided
conforming to the line of such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation,
the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater
within any portion of the easement.
H. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainageways on the site cannot
adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming substantially
to the line and grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be
subject to approval by the municipality and the DEP through the joint permit application process,
or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, through the general permit process.
I. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that would be located in or adjacent
to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall be subject to approval by DEP through the
joint permit application process, or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, the general permit process.
When there is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of the
applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands; otherwise
approval to work in the area must be obtained from DEP.
J. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that would be located on or discharge
into state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (PennDOT).
K. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through seepage beds, infiltration
trenches, etc., are required to reduce the size or eliminate the need for detention facilities.
L. Roof drains must not be discharged to streets or roadside ditches or connected to sanitary or
storm sewers. Overland flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater shall be promoted where
advantageous to do so. Only when it is more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm
sewers shall it be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the municipality.
M. All stormwater runoff shall be pretreated for water quality prior to discharge to surface or groundwater
as required by § 173-11.
N. All regulated activities within the municipality shall be designed, implemented, operated and
maintained to meet the purposes of this chapter, through these two elements:
(1) Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance activities (e.g., during construction),
and
§ 173-10 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-10
173:19 05-22-2020
(2) Water quality protection measures after completion of earth disturbance activities (i.e.,
after construction), including operations and maintenance.
O. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall commence until the
requirements of this chapter are met.
P. Post-construction water quality protection shall be addressed as required by § 173-14.
§ 173-10. Nonstructural project design (sequencing to minimize stormwater impacts).
A. The design of all regulated activities shall include the following steps in sequence to minimize
stormwater impacts.
(1) The applicant is required to find practicable alternatives to the surface discharge of stormwater,
the creation of impervious surfaces and the degradation of waters of the Commonwealth,
and must maintain as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of the site.
(2) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being done after taking into
consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes
and other municipal requirements.
(3) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are presumed to have less
adverse impact on quantity and quality of waters of the Commonwealth unless otherwise
demonstrated.
B. The applicant shall demonstrate that they designed the regulated activities in the following
sequence to minimize the increases in stormwater runoff and impacts to water quality:
(1) Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM), showing environmentally
sensitive areas including, but not limited to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands,
hydric soils, vernal pools, floodplains, stream buffer zones, hydrologic soil groups A, B, C,
and D, any existing recharge areas and any other requirements outlined in the municipal
subdivision and land development ordinance. Establish stream buffer according to recommended
criteria or applicable ordinances.
(2) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas identified in subsection B(1) of this
section and minimizing total site earth disturbance as much as possible. The ratio of disturbed
area to the entire site area and measures taken to minimize earth disturbance shall
be included in the ERSAM.
(3) Identify site specific existing conditions, drainage areas, discharge points, recharge areas,
and hydrologic soil groups A and B.
(4) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives (see Appendix B, Table B-6).
(a) Minimize earth disturbance;
§ 173-11 BRISTOL CODE § 173-11
05-22-2020 173:20
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces;
(c) Break up large impervious surfaces.
(5) Satisfy water quality objective (§ 173-11).
(6) Satisfy groundwater recharge (infiltration) objective (§ 173-12) and provide for stormwater
treatment prior to infiltration.
(7) Satisfy streambank erosion protection objective (§ 173-13).
(8) Determine what management district the site falls into (Appendix D) and conduct a predevelopment
runoff analysis.
(9) Prepare final project design to maintain predevelopment drainage areas and discharge
points, to minimize earth disturbance and impervious surfaces, and to reduce runoff to the
maximum extent possible, the use of surface or point discharges.
(10) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final design and to meet the
release rate and in turn the overbank flow and extreme event requirements (§ 173-14).
(11) Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to discharge, as part of detention,
bioretention, direct discharge or other structural control.
§ 173-11. Water quality.
A. In addition to the performance standards and design criteria requirements of this article, the applicant
shall comply with the following water quality requirements of this article:
Adequate storage and treatment facilities will be provided to capture and treat stormwater runoff
from developed or disturbed areas. The recharge volume computed under § 173-12 may be a
component of the water quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both components in a
single facility. If the recharge volume is less than the water quality volume, the remaining water
quality volume may be captured and treated by methods other than recharge/infiltration BMPs.
The required water quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity needed to capture and to treat a
portion of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the site produced from 90 percent of the
average annual rainfall (P).
To achieve this goal, the following criterion is established:
The following calculation formula is to be used to determine the water quality storage volume,
(WQv), in acre-feet of storage for the Delaware River South Watershed:
Equation: 173-11.1
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12
WQv = Water Quality Volume (acre-feet)
§ 173-11 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-11
173:21 05-22-2020
The P value for the five PennDOT rainfall regions is shown in Figure 2-B in Appendix 2 and as
shown in Appendix Table 5-B. Since the Delaware River South is in PennDOT Region 5, the P
value to be utilized to meet this requirement is 2.04 inches.
B. Design of BMPs used for water quality control shall be in accordance with design specifications
outlined in the Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas or
other applicable manuals. The following factors shall be considered when evaluating the suitability
of BMPs used to control water quality at a given development site:
(1) Total contributing drainage area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(8) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(9) Streambank erosion.
(10) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality problems.
(11) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(12) The nature of the pollutant being removed.
(13) Maintenance requirements.
(14) Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
(15) Recreational value.
(16) Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
P = Rainfall amount equal to 90 percent of events producing this rainfall (in.)
A = Area of the project contributing to the water quality BMP (acres)
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is the percent of the area that is impervious surface
(impervious area/A*100)
§ 173-12 BRISTOL CODE § 173-12
05-22-2020 173:22
C. To accomplish the above, the applicant shall submit original and innovative designs to the municipality
for review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives through a
combination of BMPs (best management practices).
§ 173-12. Groundwater recharge (infiltration).
A. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
Regulated activities will be required to recharge (infiltrate) a portion of the runoff created by the
development as part of an overall stormwater management plan designed for the site. The volume
of runoff to be recharged shall be determined from subsections A(2)(a) or (b) of this section,
depending upon demonstrated site conditions.
(1) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based
on suitability of soils and site conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and the limiting
zone.
(b) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater
load and drain completely as determined by field tests conducted by the applicant’s
design professional.
(c) The recharge facility shall be capable of completely infiltrating the recharge volume
within four days (96 hours).
(d) Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(e) The requirements for recharge are applied to all disturbed areas, even if they are ultimately
to be an undeveloped land use such as grass, since studies have found that
compaction of the soils during disturbance reduces their infiltrative capacity.
(2) The recharge volume (Re) shall be computed by first obtaining the infiltration requirement
using methods in either subsections A(2)(a) or (b) of this section, then multiplying by the
total proposed impervious area. The overall required recharge volume for a site is computed
by multiplying total impervious area by the infiltration requirement.
(a) NRCS Curve Number Equation.
The following criteria shall apply.
The NRCS runoff shall be utilized to calculate infiltration requirements (P) in
inches.
§ 173-12 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-12
173:23 05-22-2020
Equation: 173-12.1
For zero runoff: P = I (Infiltration) = (200 / CN) - 2
This equation can be displayed graphically in, and the infiltration requirement can
also be determined from, Figure 173-12-1.
The recharge volume (Rev) required would therefore be computed as:
Equation: 173-12.2
Rev = I * impervious area (SF) / 12 = Cubic Feet (CF)
(b) Annual Recharge Water Budget Approach. It has been determined that infiltrating
one-half inch of runoff from the impervious areas will aid in maintaining the hydrologic
regime of the watershed. If the goals of subsection A(2)(a) of this section cannot
be achieved, then one-half inch of rainfall shall be infiltrated from all impervious
areas, up to an existing site conditions curve number of 81. Above a curve number
of 81, Equation 173-12.1 or the curve in Figure 173-12-1 should be used to determine
the infiltration requirement.
Where: I = 0.5 inches
The recharge volume (Rev) required would therefore be computed as:
Rev = I * percent impervious area (SF) / 12 = (CF)
The recharge values derived from these methods are the minimum volumes the
applicant must control through an infiltration/recharge BMP facility. However, if a
site has areas of soils where additional volume of infiltration can be achieved, the
applicant is encouraged to recharge as much of the stormwater runoff from the site
as possible.
Where: P = I = infiltration requirement (inches)
CN = SCS(NRCS) curve number of the existing conditions
contributing to the recharge facility
§ 173-12 BRISTOL CODE § 173-12
05-22-2020 173:24
Figure 173-12-1. Infiltration Requirement Based Upon NRCS Curve Number.
B. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the suitability of
recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified applicant and, at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability.
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade features within the watershed
to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices.
(2) Provide field tests, such as double ring infiltration tests at the level of the proposed infiltration
surface, to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required storm volume based on field determined
capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface.
(4) Where the recharge volume requirement cannot be physically accomplished due to the
results of the field soils testing, supporting documentation and justification shall be supplied
to the municipality with the drainage plan.
(5) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant’s design professional, it must
be demonstrated to the municipality that the soils are conducive to infiltration on the lots
identified.
C. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in geologically susceptible
areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or
chloride would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the
groundwater. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in source water
protection areas. The qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration/recharge facility and perform a hydrogeologic justi§
173-13 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-14
173:25 05-22-2020
fication study if necessary. The infiltration requirement in high quality/exceptional value waters
shall be subject to the DEP’s 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 antidegradation regulations. The municipality
may require the installation of an impermeable liner in BMP and/or detention basins where
the possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may
be required by the municipality.
D. The municipality shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against groundwater contamination
for uses which may cause groundwater contamination, should there be a mishap or spill.
E. Recharge/infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative or traditional
BMPs, stormwater control facilities, and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
§ 173-13. Streambank erosion requirements.
In addition to the water quality volume, to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream
streambank erosion, the requirement is to design a BMP to detain the postdevelopment two-year, 24-
hour design storm to the predevelopment one-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution. Additionally,
provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure) so that
the postdevelopment one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a
point where the maximum volume of water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility).
Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the
invert of the facility). The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of clogging and
sedimentation. Orifices smaller than three-inch diameter are not recommended. However, if the design
engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are protected from clogging by use of trash racks,
etc., smaller orifices may be permitted.
In “no detention” areas (District C) only, the objective is not to attenuate the larger storms. This can be
accomplished by configuration of the outlet structure not to control the larger storms, or by a bypass or
channel to divert only the two-year flood into the basin or divert flows in excess of the two-year storm
away from the basin.
§ 173-14. Stormwater management districts.
A. Delaware River South Watershed has been divided into stormwater management districts as
shown on the Watershed Map in Appendix D. In addition to the requirements specified below,
the water quality (§ 173-11), groundwater recharge (§ 173-12), and streambank erosion
(§ 173-13) requirements shall be implemented.
§ 173-14 BRISTOL CODE § 173-14
05-22-2020 173:26
Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Delaware River South Watershed are
shown below. Development sites located in each of the A, B, or C Districts must control postdevelopment
runoff rates to predevelopment runoff rates for the design storms as follows:
* In District C, development sites which can discharge directly to the Delaware River South main channel
or major tributaries or indirectly to the main channel through an existing stormwater drainage system
(i.e., storm sewer or tributary) may do so without control of postdevelopment peak rate of runoff
greater than the five-year storm. Sites in District C will still have to comply with the groundwater
recharge criteria, the water quality criteria, and streambank erosion criteria. If the postdevelopment runoff
is intended to be conveyed by an existing stormwater drainage system to the main channel, assurance
must be provided that such system has adequate capacity to convey the flows greater than the twoyear
predevelopment peak flow or will be provided with improvements to furnish the required capacity.
When adequate capacity in the downstream system does not exist and will not be provided through
improvements, the postdevelopment peak rate of runoff must be controlled to the predevelopment peak
rate as required in District A provisions (i.e., 10-year postdevelopment flows to 10-year predevelopment
flows) for the specified design storms.

§ 173-15 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-15
173:27 05-22-2020
§ 173-15. Stormwater management district implementation provisions (performance standards).
A. General. Postdevelopment peak rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall meet the peak
release rates of runoff prior to development for the design storms specified on the stormwater
management district watershed map (Appendix D) and § 173-10.
B. District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an
official stormwater district map that is available for inspection at the municipal office. A copy of
the map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix D. The exact location of the stormwater management
district boundaries, as they apply to a given development site, shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours (or most accurate data required)
provided as part of the drainage plan.
C. Sites Located in More Than One District. For a proposed development site located within two or
more stormwater management district category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea
shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea as indicated in § 173-10. The
calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage
area by subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas
recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100
percent release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release
rate.
D. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not subject to
release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
E. Site Areas. Where the area of a site being impacted by a proposed development activity differs
significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management
measures shall be subject to the management district criteria; unimpacted or undisturbed
areas that do flow into or are bypassing the stormwater management facilities would not be subject
to the management district criteria.
F. “No Harm” Option. For any proposed development site not located in a provisional direct discharge
district, the applicant has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no
detention) if the applicant can prove that “no harm” would be caused by discharging at a higher
runoff rate than that specified by the plan. The no harm option is used when a applicant can prove
that the postdevelopment hydrographs can match predevelopment hydrographs, or if it can be
proved that the postdevelopment conditions will not cause increases in peaks at all points downstream.
Proof of no harm would have to be shown based upon the following downstream impact
evaluation which shall include a downstream hydraulic capacity analysis consistent with subsection
G of this section to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists. The land applicant shall
submit to the municipality this evaluation of the impacts due to increased downstream stormwater
flows in the watershed.
(1) The downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations
necessary to determine the impact of hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed
§ 173-15 BRISTOL CODE § 173-15
05-22-2020 173:28
development upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted streamflow, or any
stream channel section, established with the concurrence of the municipality.
(2) The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow diminishes due to
additional flow from tributaries and/or stream attenuation.
(3) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms
(two-, five-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year) shall be the values from the calibrated model for
the Delaware River South Watershed. These flow values can be obtained from the watershed
plan.
(4) Applicant-proposed runoff controls that would generate increased peak flow rates at storm
drainage problem areas would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no-harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem
areas consistent with subsection H of this section.
(5) Financial considerations shall not constitute grounds for granting a no-harm exemption.
(6) Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to implement the no-harm option
which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge
control would not create any harm downstream.
(7) Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the applicant as part of the drainage plan
submission per Article IV.
G. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any downstream capacity hydraulic analysis conducted
in accordance with this chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy
for accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated
with a one-and-one-half-year return period event within their banks at velocities
consistent with protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be
based upon criteria included in the Department of Environmental Protection’s Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey increased 25-year return
period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows
from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with the Department of Environmental
Protection’s 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and, at minimum,
pass the increased 25-year return period runoff.
H. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study area, it may be more costeffective
to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an
individual control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional
runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective applicants. The design of any
§ 173-16 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 173-16
173:29 05-22-2020
regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed.
The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis using
the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed
areas. “Hydrologic model” refers to the calibrated model as developed for the stormwater management
plan. It is a requirement that, even if regional basins are proposed for the water quantity
control, the water quality, streambank erosion and recharge criteria be accomplished on site, or as
close to the source of the runoff as possible.
§ 173-16. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
A. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
B. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to store runoff and requiring
a berm or earthen embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be designed to provide
an emergency spillway to handle flow up to and including the 100-year postdevelopment conditions.
The height of embankment must be set as to provide a minimum one foot of freeboard
above the maximum pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the 100-year postdevelopment
inflow. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit
under 25 Pa. Code, Environmental Protection, Chapter 105, Dam Safety and Waterway Management,
the facility shall be designed in accordance with 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 and meet the
regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be required to pass
storms larger than the 100-year event.
C. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream enclosures),
and any work involving wetlands as directed in 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 regulations (as
amended or replaced from time to time by DEP), shall be designed in accordance with 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 105 and will require a permit from DEP. Any other drainage conveyance facility
that does not fall under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 regulations must be able to convey, without
damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the 25-year design storm with a minimum
one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway. Roadway
crossings located within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a
100-year design storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point
along the top of the roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as defined in 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105 regulations may require a permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility located
within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit
submission requirements.
D. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105 regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or roadway,
runoff from the 10-year design storm. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater management
facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design flow to or from
that structure. Roadway crossings located within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey
runoff from a 100-year design storm. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way
must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit submission requirements.

E. Storm sewers must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff from a 100-year design storm
without surcharging inlets, where appropriate.
F. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels, and at all points of discharge.
G. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate sound engineering principles
and practices. The municipality shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that would
result in the creation, exacerbation, or continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition
within the watershed.
§ 173-17. Calculation methodology.
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the rational method or a
soil-cover-complex methodology.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use a generally accepted calculation technique that is
based on the NRCS soil-cover-complex method. Table 173-17-1 summarizes acceptable computation
methods. It is assumed that all methods will be selected by the applicant based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
The municipality may allow the use of the rational method to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres. The rational method is recommended for drainage
areas under 100 acres.
B. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms according to the region for
which they are located as presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B. If a hydrologic computer model
such as HEC-1 or HEC-HMS is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of
rainfall shall be 24 hours. The SCS “S” curve shown in Figure B-1, Appendix B, shall be used for
the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination, undeveloped land shall be considered
as “meadow” in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve
number or rational “C” value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table B-2 or B-3 in Appendix B. For areas
of prior mining disturbance (i.e., strip mining, mine spoil areas, etc.), the designer must first identify
in which mining affect area the site is located, using the management district map in Appendix
D. The appropriate curve number or rational “C” value from Table B-2 or Table B-3 should
then be used.
D. All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall intensities consistent with appropriate
times-of-concentration for overland flow and return periods from the design storm curves from
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figures B-2 to B-3).
Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented in
Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced
from time to time by NRCS). Times-of-concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed
using Manning’s equation.

173:31 05-22-2020
E. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to be used in the soilcover-
complex method shall be obtained from Table B-2 in Appendix B.
F. Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use in the rational method
shall be obtained from Table B-3 in Appendix B.
G. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydraulic computations,
and to determine the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning’s
roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in Appendix B.
Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance
standards of this chapter using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
H. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance standards of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities
using the storage-indication method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size, the design
storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation
technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method
that produces a full hydrograph.

General Provisions
§ 174-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Neshaminy Creek Watershed Stormwater Management
Ordinance” (a.k.a. Neshaminy/Little Neshaminy Stormwater Management Ordinance).
§ 174-2 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 174-3
174:3 05-22-2020
§ 174-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases
the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and
redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the
natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and
elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals,
and pathogens.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including reasonable regulation
of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the
Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies
and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully
addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
§ 174-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare within the Neshaminy
Creek Watershed by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 174-2, through provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the
waters of this Commonwealth.
B. Minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flows.
C. Minimize impervious surfaces.
§ 174-4 BRISTOL CODE § 174-5
05-22-2020 174:4
D. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
E. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
F. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a minimum of structures and
relying on natural processes.
G. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of
surface and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
H. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
I. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
J. Provide standards to meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
requirements.
K. Address certain requirements of the municipal separate stormwater sewer system (MS4) NPDES
Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
L. Provide for proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater management facilities and best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented in the municipality.
§ 174-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff, surface, and groundwater
quality and quantity by the authority of:
A. Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.

§ 174-6. Exemptions.
A. Regulated activities that create impervious surfaces smaller than or equal to 1,000 square feet are
exempt from the peak rate control requirements and the SWM site plan preparation located in
Article IV unless the activity is found to be a significant contributor of pollution to the waters of
this Commonwealth.
B. Regulated activities that create impervious surfaces between 1,001 square feet up to and including
5,000 square feet are exempt only from the peak rate control requirements of this chapter.
(Refer to Appendix I which contains the small project SWM site plan for small regulated activities
creating impervious surface between 1,000 square feet up to and including 5,000 square feet.

practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas
structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is installed to
capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of
practices and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground
treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds,
permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured
devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.
BIORETENTION — A stormwater retention area that utilizes woody and herbaceous plants and soils
to remove pollutants before infiltration occurs.
BUFFER — The area of land immediately adjacent to any stream, measured perpendicular to and horizontally
from the top-of-bank on both sides of a stream (see TOP-OF-BANK).

§ 174-13. Permit requirements by other governmental entities.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility
to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance.
§ 174-14. Volume control.
Volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect stream channel morphology, maintain
groundwater recharge, and contribute to water quality improvements. Stormwater runoff volume control
methods are based on the net change in runoff volume for the two-year storm event.
Volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in subsection A of this section or
the simplified method in subsection B of this section. For regulated activities equal to or less than one
acre, this chapter establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations of the procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors. All regulated activities greater than one acre must
use the design storm method.
A. Design Storm Method (Any Regulated Activity). This method requires detailed modeling based
on site conditions. For modeling assumptions refer to § 174-16A.
(1) Postdevelopment total runoff should not be increased from predevelopment total runoff for
all storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
(2) The following applies in order to estimate the increased volume of runoff for the two-year
24-hour duration precipitation event:
To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site conditions (predevelopment)
and for the proposed developed site conditions (postdevelopment), it is recommended to
use the soil-cover-complex method as shown in this subsection. Table B-3 in Appendix B
is available to guide a qualified professional and/or an applicant to calculate the stormwater
runoff volume. The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired, or infiltrated
through structural or nonstructural means.
§ 174-14 BRISTOL CODE § 174-14
05-22-2020 174:22
Soil-Cover-Complex Method:
Step 1: Runoff (in.) = Q = (P - 0.2S)2 / (P + 0.8S) where
P = 2-year Rainfall (in.)
S = (1,000 / CN) - 10, the potential maximum retention (including initial abstraction,
Ia)
Step 2: Runoff Volume (Cubic Feet) = Q x Area x 1/12
Q = Runoff (in.)
Area = SWM Area (sq. ft.)
B. Simplified Method (regulated activities less than or equal to one acre):
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
Volume (cubic feet) = (2-inch runoff /12 inches) * impervious surface (sq. ft.)
(2) At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious surfaces shall be permanently
removed from the runoff flow; i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of
the Commonwealth. The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired or infiltrated
through structural or nonstructural means.
Volume (cubic feet) = (1-inch runoff /12 inches) * impervious surface (sq. ft.)
(3) Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the first half-inch of the permanently
removed runoff.
(4) No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious surfaces shall be released from
the site. The release time must be over 24 to 72 hours.
C. Stormwater Control Measures. The applicant must demonstrate how the required volume is controlled
through stormwater best management practices (BMPs) which shall provide the means
necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the total runoff volume.
(1) If natural resources exist on the site, the applicant who is required to submit a SWM site
plan shall determine the total acreage of protected area where no disturbance is proposed.
The acreage of the protected area should be subtracted from the total site area and not
included in the stormwater management site area acreage used in determining the volume
controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area =
{Total Site Area (for both pre- and postdevelopment conditions) - Protected Area}
§ 174-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 174-14
174:23 05-22-2020
Natural resource areas should be calculated based upon the municipality’s own natural
resource protection ordinance. If no ordinance exists, see Table B-2 in Appendix B for
guidance to assess the total protected area. For additional reference see Chapter 5, Section
5.4.1 of the PA BMP manual.
(2) Calculate the volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs. Table B-5 in Appendix
B is recommended as guidance.
(3) Volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs should be subtracted from the
required volume to determine the necessary structural BMPs.
(4) Calculate the volume controls provided through structural BMPs. Table B-6 in Appendix
B is recommended as guidance. See PA BMP Manual Chapter 6 for description of the
BMPs.
(5) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based
on the suitability of soils and site conditions (see Table B-6 in Appendix B for a list of
infiltration BMPs). Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
(a) A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the infiltration BMPs and
the top of bedrock or seasonally high water table.
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load and dewater
completely as determined by field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inches/hour (in/hr)
should be utilized and for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50 percent should be
applied for design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4 in/hr, the BMP design
should use 0.2 in/hr to insure safe infiltration rates after construction).
(c) All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely infiltrate runoff
volume within three days (72 hours) from the start of the design storm.
(6) Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the suitability of
infiltration facilities. All regulated activities are required to perform a detailed soils evaluation
by a qualified design professional which at minimum addresses soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration
BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade features within the
site to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations
of subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting
these tests.

(b) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic conductivity tests
(at the level of the proposed infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate
hydraulic conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(c) Design the infiltration structure based on field determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface and based on the safety factor of 50 percent.
(d) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be demonstrated to the municipality
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
(e) An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the possibility of
groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the municipality.
§ 174-15. Stormwater peak rate control and management districts.
Peak rate controls for large storms, up to the 100-year event, is essential in order to protect against
immediate downstream erosion and flooding. The following peak rate controls have been determined
through hydrologic modeling of the Neshaminy Creek Watershed.
A. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Neshaminy Creek Watershed for the
two-, five-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year design storms are shown in Table 174-15-1. Development
sites located in each of the management districts must control proposed development conditions
runoff rates to existing conditions runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with Table
174-15-1.

B. General. Proposed conditions rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the
peak release rates of runoff from existing conditions for the design storms specified on the stormwater
management district watershed map (Appendix D) and in this section.
C. District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on official
maps and are available for inspection at the municipal office and county planning offices. A
copy of the map at a reduced scale, and four other maps with zoomed-in extents are included in
Appendix D. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply
to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part of the SWM site plan.
D. Sites Located in More Than One District. For a proposed development site located within two or
more stormwater management district category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea
shall meet the management district criteria for the district in which the discharge is located.
E. Off-Site Areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates, developers do not have to
account for runoff draining into the subject development site from an off-site area. On-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.

F. Site Areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area subject to the management district
criteria. Nonimpacted areas or nonregulated activities bypassing the stormwater management
facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
G. Alternate Criteria for Redevelopment Sites. For redevelopment sites, one of the following minimum
design parameters shall be accomplished, whichever is most appropriate for the given site
conditions as determined by Bristol Township.
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Table 174-15-1 and subsections A through F of
this section; or
(2) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20 percent based upon a comparison
of existing impervious surface to proposed impervious surface.
§ 174-16. Calculation methodology.
A. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground cover used to determine
the existing conditions runoff volume and flow rate shall be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of “woods in good condition.” A site is classified
as wooded if a continuous canopy of trees exists over one-quarter acre.
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare earth, and fallow
ground shall be considered as “meadow in good condition,” unless the natural
ground cover generates a lower curve number (CN) or rational “C” value (i.e.,
woods) as listed in Tables B-4 or B-7 in Appendix B of this chapter.
(2) For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used to determine the existing
conditions runoff volume and flow rate for the developed portion of the site shall be based
upon actual land cover conditions. If the developed site contains impervious surfaces, 20
percent of the impervious surface area shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions.
B. Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a drainage area equal to or
greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation technique that is
based on the NRCS soil-cover-complex method. Table 174-16-1 summarizes acceptable computation
methods. The method selected by the design professional shall be based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site. The municipality may allow the
use of the rational method (Q = CIA) to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain
less than 200 acres.
Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (CFS)
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover
§ 174-16 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 174-16
174:27 05-22-2020
I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour
A = Drainage area, acres
C. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 rain data corresponding to the
Doylestown rain gage, seen in Table B-1 in Appendix B. The SCS Type II rainfall curve from
NOAA is found on Figure B-1 in Appendix B. This data may also be directly retrieved from the
NOAA Atlas 14 website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/pa_pfds.html. If a hydrologic computer
model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for stormwater runoff calculations,
then the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours.

standards of this chapter using the generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method of
the municipality.
J. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance standards of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities
using the storage-indication method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size, the design
storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation
technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method
that produces a full hydrograph.

§ 177-12 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-13
§ 177-12. Preventive remedies.
A. In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain appropriate
actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent unlawful
construction, to recover damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure
or premises. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or
transferor from such penalties or from the remedies provided herein.
B. The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further
improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted
from a subdivision of real property in violation of any ordinance adopted pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.14 This authority to
deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants: the owner
of record at the time of such violation; the vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the
time of such violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation; the current owner of record who acquired the
property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation; the vendee or lessee of the
current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation
without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge
of the violation. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the development of such
real property, the Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have
been applicable to the property at the time that the applicant acquired an interest in such
property.
§ 177-13. Enforcement.
A. Any persons, partnership, or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of any
subdivision or land development ordinance enacted under this act or prior enabling laws
shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by
the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor appeals the judgment in
a timely manner, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the District Justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating the ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event
there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following
the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.

two stages, preliminary and final, and may also include a sketch plan stage at the option
of the applicant. These stages may be necessary to provide the Planning Commission and
Council adequate opportunity to review each proposal and to ensure that their formal
recommendations are reflected in the final plan. The separate stages of approval include
the submission of an optional sketch plan, a preliminary plan, and a final plan. These
plans differ in their purpose and required level of detail. The table below indicates the
recommended and required plans for the different types of submissions.

has been filed. If the applicant agrees in writing to an extension of time, the ninety-day
period may be extended.

separate submission and the maximum ninety-day review period may be required for
each such plan.

tract shall be submitted initially. Preliminary approval of the plan must be obtained for
the entire proposed development. Final approval may be obtained phase by phase, but

numbered in the proposed order that they are to be developed. Such order of
development must be adhered to, and if changes are required, plans must be refiled and

be developed independently and stand on its own meeting all applicable Township
ordinances without other phases, including the street system and utilities.

Design Standards
177-32. Applicability.
A. The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be considered minimum standards
and requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. The following subdivision and land development principles, standards, and requirements
will be applied by the Planning Commission and Council in evaluating plans for
proposed subdivisions and land developments.
C. Whenever municipal or other applicable regulations impose more restrictive standards
and requirements than those outlined herein, such other regulations shall control.
§ 177-33. General design requirements.
A. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets, public lands, or
other proposed uses, so that remnants and landlocked areas shall not be created. No lot
177:29 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-33 BRISTOL CODE § 177-33
shall be subdivided under the provisions of this chapter if any of the parts thus created
shall not be usable under the provisions of the Bristol Township Zoning Ordinance.'
B. Reserve strips controlling access to lots, public rights-of-way, public lands or adjacent
private lands shall be prohibited unless their control is approved by Council. Council
may request inclusion of reserve strips to control access to major thoroughfares or
prohibit industrial or commercial access to residential streets.
C. In general, lot lines shall follow Township boundary lines rather than cross them.
D. Where trees, groves, waterways, scenic points, historic facilities, or other community
assets and landmarks are located within a proposed subdivision or land development,
every possible means to the fullest extent shall be provided to preserve these features.
E. Proposed subdivisions and land developments may be coordinated with existing nearby
neighborhoods both within and outside of the Township so that the community, as a
whole, may develop harmoniously. Joint reviews with neighboring municipalities may be
conducted at Council's discretion.
F. Subdivisions and land developments shall be properly designed in order to prevent the
necessity for excessive cut or fill. Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out
to come as close as possible to balancing cut and fill operations on-site.
G. Land subject to flooding or other hazards to life, health, or property, and land deemed to
be topographically unsuitable, shall not be platted for any use that may increase danger
to health, life or property, nor aggravate erosion or flood hazard. All such hazards must
be shown on the subdivision or land development plans.
H. Subdivisions and land developments shall be in strict conformity with the floodplain
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance, Building Code,18 and as specifically provided under
§ 177-56 of this chapter.
I. There shall be strict compliance with all of the provisions of this chapter unless
specifically waived by Council.
J. Where no public water supply is available to the subdivision or land development, the
Township shall require the developer to obtain from a licensed testing laboratory
certificates of approval for each lot as to the quality and adequacy of the water supply
proposed to be utilized by the developer. In all cases where the water supply is from a
well, the developer shall obtain from the Bucks County Health Department a certificate
indicating compliance with the applicable state and county health regulations and shall
submit such certificate to the Township.
K. Where sanitary sewers are inaccessible to a proposed subdivision or land development
and on-lot sewage is to be provided, plans shall not be approved without a feasibility
report from the Bucks County Health Department. No final plans may be recorded

highway plans as have been prepared, adopted, and/or filed as prescribed by law, and to
the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan. When ambiguity or conflict exists, Council
shall determine which shall apply.
C. The arrangement of streets in a subdivision or land development shall either provide for
the continuation of appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding
areas, or conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by Council to meet
a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or
conformance to existing streets impractical.
D. Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades,
satisfactory drainage, and suitable building sites.
E. Residential streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
F. Where a subdivision or development abuts or contains an existing or proposed
expressway, arterial or collector street, Council, with the advice of the Planning
Commission, may require either marginal access, reverse frontage with screen planting
along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of properties, to afford separation of through and local traffic and to reduce
the number of access points on major streets.
G. Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear
the names of the existing streets in the Township or within the zip code area. Street
names shall not be repeated or streets assigned names which may be confused with
names of existing streets, and all street names shall be subject to the approval of Council.

the right-of-way for the last 75 feet of their length. It shall be the developer's
responsibility to remove the temporary paving.
L. Private streets may be approved only if they are designed to meet Township street
standards and if there is safe and convenient access for emergency vehicles.
M. Council may, in the interest of highway safety, and the safety of the area residents and in
order to promote orderly community development, require the owner/developer of any
large commercial complex such as shopping centers, industrial parks or plants, housing
projects, apartment complexes, major educational or recreational facilities and other
significant traffic generators to have prepared a traffic study by a competent traffic
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to meet with a
representative of the Township Engineer's office and the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation to achieve a high level of design from the standpoint of traffic.
N. No plan which will require access to a highway under the jurisdiction of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) shall be finally approved unless
the plan contains a notice that a highway occupancy permit is required pursuant to
Section 420 of the Act of June 1, 1945 (P.L. 1242, No. 42819) known as the "State
Highway Law," before driveway access to a state highway is permitted. The plan shall be

§ 177-51 BRISTOL CODE § 177-52
University of Pennsylvania, September 1980. The report is contained in the Appendix of
this chapter.
D. Planting specifications and installation.
(1) Street trees and other required plants shall be of nursery stock grown under
climatic conditions comparable to those of Bristol Township. They shall be of
symmetrical growth, free of insects, pests, and disease, and be suitable for street
use and durable under the maintenance contemplated.
(2) All plants shall meet the minimum standards for health, form and root conditions
as outlined in the American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) Standards and shall
be hardy within the USDA Hardiness Zone 6.
(3) At the time of installation, the trunk diameter measured at a height of six inches
above the finished grade level shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches.
(4) Required landscaping and street trees shall be maintained permanently and any
plant material which does not survive shall be replaced within six months.
(5) A performance bond shall be posted with the Township in an amount equal to
100% of the estimated cost of the trees and plantings, to be released 18 months
after completion of the project and acceptance by the Township.
177-52. Tree protection.
A. General requirements.
(1) A tree protection zone (TPZ) must be constructed around any tree which is to be
retained. Where there is a group of trees or woodlands, the tree protection zone
shall be the aggregate of the protection zones for the individual trees.
(2) Grade changes and excavations shall not encroach upon the tree protection zone
(TPZ).
(3) No toxic materials shall be stored within 100 feet of a TPZ, including petroleum
based and/or derived products.
(4) The area within the TPZ shall not be built upon, nor shall any materials be stored
there either temporarily or permanently. Vehicles and equipment shall not be
parked in the TPZ.
(5) When tree stumps are located within 10 feet of the TPZ the stumps shall be
removed by means of a stump grinder to minimize the effect on surrounding root
systems.
(6) Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment
aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces the lateral movement of the roots
during excavation, which if done by other methods could damage the intertwined
roots of adjacent trees.
177:80 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-52 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-52
(7) Within four hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have been exposed
and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily with moist peat
moss, moist burlap or other moist biodegradable material to keep them from drying
out until permanent cover can be installed.
(8) Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not discharge into nor be located
within the TPZ.
B. The tree protection zone (TPZ). Prior to construction, the tree protection zone shall be
delineated by the following methods:
(1) The TPZ that is delineated on the site prior to construction shall conform to the
approved development plans.
(2) All trees scheduled to remain shall be marked; where groups of trees exist, only
the trees on the edge need to be marked.
(3) A forty-eight-inch-high wooden snow fence mounted on steel posts, located eight
feet on center, shall be placed along the boundary of the TPZ.
(4) In addition to the TPZ, trees may be left standing as protection between the trunks
of the trees to be retained and the limits of grading. When additional trees are used
as protection, the TPZ on the approved plan shall be marked in the field so that the
additional buffer area is delineated. When this method of protection is used, these
additional trees shall be removed at the time of completion of the project.
(5) When the wooden snow fence has been installed, it shall be inspected and
approved by the municipal arborist prior to commencing clearing and further
construction; the fencing along the TPZ shall be maintained until all
work/construction has been completed; any damages to the protective fencing shall
be replaced and repaired before further construction shall begin.
(6) Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a TPZ or into trees
that are to be retained.
(7) Any trees within the TPZ that die during the construction of a land development or
during the eighteen-month maintenance period, where applicable, shall be removed
by the developer and replaced with an approved canopy tree in a location
designated by Council.
C. Retaining walls.
(1) When the original grade can not be retained at the TPZ line, a retaining wall shall
be constructed outside of the TPZ.
(2) The retaining wall shall be designed to comply with the municipal standards for
retaining walls.
(3) In addition, the following methods shall be used to ensure the survival of the tree:
177:81 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-52 BRISTOL CODE § 177-52
(a) The top of the wall shall be four inches above the finished grade line.
(b) The wall shall be constructed of large stones, brick, building tile, concrete
blocks, or treated wood beams not less than six inches by six inches; a means
for drainage through the wall shall be provided so water will not accumulate
on either side of the wall; weep holes shall be required with any wall.
Proposed Grade
Fill
Existing Grad.
(c) Any severed roots as a result of excavation shall be trimmed so that their
edges are smooth and are cut back to a lateral root if exposed.
(d) A layer of clean stone (sized 3/4 to one inch) shall be placed one foot out
from the wall to aid in drainage.
D. Pruning methods. All final cuts shall be made sufficiently close to the trunk or parent
limb but without cutting into the branch collar or leaving a protruding stub, according to
the National Arborist Association standards. All necessary pruning cuts must be made to
prevent bark from being torn from the tree and to facilitate rapid healing. Flush cuts are
unacceptable.
E. Fertilization methods.
(1) All trees which have experienced any disturbance or have had damages to the roots
or branches shall be fertilized.
(2) Trees shall be fertilized in early fall (September-October) or mid-spring
(April-May). Fall applications are preferred.
(3) Fertilizer shall be broadcast over the soil surface in an area twice the size of the
TPZ at the rates given below in Subsection E(5). A minimum of 1,000 square feet
per tree will receive fertilization.
(4) Fertilizer grade shall have approximately three parts nitrogen to one part
phosphorus and potassium (3:1:1 ratio).
(5) Fertilizer shall be applied at a rate equivalent to one pound nitrogen per 1,000
square feet.
F. Trenching and tunneling.
(1) If there is no alternative but to locate a utility line through a TPZ, tunneling shall
be used instead of trenching, except where in the opinion of the municipal arborist,
177:82 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-52 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-53
survival of the tree would not be affected by either method. The municipal arborist
shall determine the most desirable location for the utility line.
(2) Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible, and tamped lightly to avoid air spaces.
177-53. Recreation areas and community facilities.
A. General. All residential subdivision or land development submissions to the Township
shall be required to provide for the public dedication or reservation of land suitable for
park and/or recreation use in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(1) A minimum of 1,500 square feet of suitable recreation land shall be provided per
dwelling unit within all residential subdivisions or land developments, unless the
developer agrees to a fee in lieu thereof as outlined in § 177-53C listed below.
(2) Recreation areas shall be readily accessible to all development residents; or, in the
case of recreation areas dedicated to the Township, shall be easily and safely
accessible to the general public. At least one side of the recreation area shall abut a
street for a minimum distance of 50 feet for access of emergency and maintenance
vehicles.
(3) The configuration of the recreation area must be suitable for active or passive
recreation by reason of its size, shape, location and topography. The required
minimum area shall not include narrow or irreguldr pieces of land which are
remnants from plotting and/or street and parking areas.
(4) The site or sites shall have suitable topography and soil conditions for use and
development as a recreation area.
(5) Recreation areas shall not be traversed by utility easements unless said utilities are
placed underground and no part of them or their supportive equipment protrudes
above ground level.
B. Dedication to the Township.
(1) In a case where the developer does not wish to retain the required recreation area
or open space, or it is not accepted by an approved conservation organization, such
area may be dedicated to the Township for public use.
(2) Before approving any site to be dedicated to the Township for recreational areas
and open space, Council shall seek the advice of the Township Park and
Recreation Board and the Township Planning Commission.
(3) Such area dedicated to the Township for public use shall be suitable for
recreational purposes or open space by reasons of size, shape, location,
topography, and access.
(4) If Council deems it to be in the public interest to accept in dedication land for
recreational purposes and open space purposes, such acceptance shall be by
adoption of a resolution or ordinance of Council and acceptance of a deed of
dedication from the developer, and in addition thereto the developer shall
177:83 06 -15 - 2005
§ 177-53 BRISTOL CODE § 177-54
contribute to the Township a sum of money to be determined by resolution of
Council. Said sum shall be deposited in a special maintenance account by the
Township and shall be used only for the purpose of developing and maintaining
dedicated land within the Township. In addition, where Council has deemed it to
be in the public interest to accept in dedication land for recreational purposes and
open space purposes, the developer shall contribute to the Township a sum of
money to be determined by resolution of Council. Said sum shall be deposited in a
special capital reserve account by the Township and shall be used only for the
purpose of acquisition of land or capital improvements for park and recreation
purposes.
(5) If Council deems it to be in the public interest to accept in dedication land for
drainage detention or retention purposes, such acceptance shall be by adoption of a
resolution or ordinance of Council and acceptance of a deed of dedication from the
developer, and in addition thereto, the developer shall contribute to the Township a
sum of money to be determined by resolution of Council. Said sum shall be
deposited in a special maintenance account by the Township and shall be used
only for the purpose of maintaining dedicated land within the Township.
C. Fee in lieu of dedication.
(1) Where Council agrees that because of the size, shape, location, access, topography
or other physical features of the land or any other need of the Township, that it is
impractical to dedicate land to the Township or set aside a recreation area or open
space area as required by this chapter, Council shall require a payment of a fee in
lieu of dedication of such land from the developer which shall be payable to the
Township prior to approval of each final section of the overall plan by Council.
Such fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of dwelling units in each
section by the fee per dwelling unit.
(2) The amount of the fee shall be determined by resolution of Council.
(3) All moneys paid to the Township pursuant to the park and recreation land
requirements shall be kept in a capital reserve fund. Moneys in such fund shall be
used only for the acquisition of land or capital improvements for park and
recreation purposes.

(2) Council, at its discretion, may require any subdivision or land development to be
accompanied by a transportation impact study; provided, however, that Council
notifies the applicant immediately following Council's first meeting to consider the
proposal. Such a notification shall specify the reason for the requirement, citing the
proposal's particular location or existing problems or type of use (e.g., generation
of heavy truck traffic). Council may, in its discretion, waive the requirement of a
transportation impact study when it determines that such a study is unnecessary.
D. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
LEVEL OF SERVICE — Level of service, as described in the 1985 Highway Capacity
Manual, indicates how well traffic moves on a particular highway facility or through a
specific intersection. There are six levels of servicing ranging from A through F. Level of
service A indicates generally free movement. Level of service E represents maximum
capacity of the facility. Level of service F indicates congestion. Level of service C is
considered the design level of service, representing a stable traffic flow and a relatively
satisfactory travel speed.
MAJOR INTERSECTION — Any intersection where traffic generated by the proposal
will have a significant impact on the operation of the intersection. Where doubt exists,
the transportation engineer shall seek guidance from the Township Engineer prior to the
submission of the traffic impact study.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION — Transportation service for the general public provided
by a common carrier of passengers generally on a regular route basis, by the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority or a private operator offering service
to the public.
STUDY AREA — This area will extend approximately 1/2 mile along the adjacent
roadway in both directions from all access points or to a major intersection along these
roadways. Where doubt exists, the transportation engineer shall seek guidance from the
Township Engineer prior to the submission of the traffic impact study.
177:90 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-57 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-57
TRIP GENERATION RATES — The total count of trips to and from a study site per
unit of land use as measured by parameters like dwelling units, acres, etc.
VOLUME/CAPACITY ANALYSIS — This procedure compares the volume of a
roadway or intersection approach to its capacity (maximum number of vehicles that can
pass in a given point during a given time period). The procedures described in the 1985
Highway Capacity Manual, Highway Transportation Research Board Special Report 209,
shall be followed.
WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLATION — This is a series of eight
warrants which detail the minimum traffic or pedestrian volumes or other criteria
necessary for the installation of a traffic signal. These warrants are contained in
PennDOT's Publication 201, Engineering and Traffic Studies, 1982.
E. General requirements and standards. A transportation impact study shall contain the
following information:
(1) General site description. The site description shall include the size, location,
proposed land uses, construction staging, and completion date of the proposed land
development. If the development is residential, types of dwelling units and number
of bedrooms shall also be included. A brief description of other major existing and
proposed land developments within the study area shall be provided. The general
site description shall also include probable socioeconomic characteristics of
potential site users to the extent that they may affect the transportation needs of the
site (e.g., number of senior citizens).
(2) Transportation facilities description.
(a) The description shall contain a full documentation of the proposed internal
and existing external transportation system. This description shall include
proposed internal vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation, all proposed
ingress and egress locations, all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way,
parking conditions, traffic channelizations, and any traffic signals or other
intersection control devices at all intersections within the site. The site design
shall be shown to maximize potential public transportation usage to and from
.the development, such as providing adequate turning radius at all access
points to allow a bus to enter the development. Bus shelter and sign locations
shall be designated where appropriate.
(b) The report shall describe the entire external roadway system within the study
area. Major intersections in the study area shall be identified and sketched.
All existing and proposed public transportation services and facilities within a
one-mile radius of the site shall also be documented. All future highway
improvements, including proposed construction and traffic signalization, shall
be noted. This information shall be obtained from the Delaware Valley
Regional Planning Commission's Regional Transportation Improvement
Program, as most recently updated. Any proposed roadway improvements
due to proposed surrounding developments shall be recorded.
(3) Existing traffic conditions.

§ 177-57 BRISTOL CODE § 177-57
(a) Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented for all
roadways and intersections in the study area. Existing traffic volumes for
average daily traffic, peak highway-hour(s) traffic, and peak
development-generated hour(s) traffic shall be recorded. Traffic counts
consisting of through traffic and turning movements at all intersections in the
study area shall be conducted, encompassing the peak highway and
development-generated hour(s), and documentation shall be included in the
report. A volume/capacity analysis based upon existing volumes shall be
performed during the peak highway hour(s) and the peak
development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in
the study area. Levels of service shall be determined for each location.
(b) This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway system to
serve the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or intersections experiencing
levels of service E or F shall be noted as congestion locations.
(4) Transportation impact of the development. Estimation of vehicular trips to result
from the proposal shall be completed for the average daily peak highway hour(s)
and peak development-generated hour(s). Vehicular trip generation rates to be used
for this calculation shall be obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers
Trip Generation, 6th Edition, 1997. These development-generated traffic
movements as estimated, and the reference source(s) and methodology followed
shall be documented. All turning movements shall be calculated. These generated
volumes shall be distributed to the study area and assigned to the existing
roadways and intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of all
assumptions used in the distribution and assignment phase shall be provided.
Traffic volumes shall be assigned to individual access points. Pedestrian volumes
shall also be calculated, if applicable. If school crossings are to be used, pedestrian
volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any characteristics of the site that will
cause particular trip generation problems shall be noted.
(5) Analysis of transportation impact.
(a) The total future traffic demand shall be calculated. This demand shall consist
of the combination of the existing traffic expanded to the completion year
(using an annual background traffic growth rate available from the Bucks
County Planning Commission), the development-generated traffic, and the
traffic generated by other proposed developments in the study area. A second
volume/capacity analysis shall be conducted using the total future demand
and the future roadway capacity. If staging of the proposed development is
anticipated, calculations for each stage of completion shall be made. This
analysis shall be performed during the peak highway hour(s) and peak
development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in
the study area. Volume/capacity calculations shall be completed for all major
intersections. It is usually at these locations that capacity is most restricted.
(b) All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined as to the
feasibility of installing traffic signals. This evaluation shall compare the
177:92 06 -15 - 2005
§ 177-57 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-57
projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants for traffic signal
installation.
(6) Conclusions and recommended improvements.
(a) Levels of service for all roadways and intersections shall be listed. All
roadways and/or intersections showing a level of service below C shall be
considered deficient, and specific recommendations for the elimination of
these problems shall be listed. This listing of recommended improvements
shall include, but not be limited to the following elements: internal
circulation design, site access location and design, external roadway and
intersection design and improvements, traffic signal installation and operation
including signal timing, and transit design improvements. All physical
roadway improvements shall be shown in sketches.
(b) Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also be addressed. A
listing of all actions to be undertaken to increase present public transportation
usage and improve service, if applicable, shall be included. An analysis based
on the guidelines contained in the Bucks County Public Transportation Study
"Phase I" Report shall be undertaken to indicate whether or not future public
transportation service should be provided to the development.
(c) The listing of recommended improvements for both roadways and transit
shall include, for each improvement, the • party responsible for the
improvement, the cost and funding of the improvement, and the completion
date for the improvement.
F. Time of submission.
(1) The Transportation Impact Study shall be submitted to the Township of Bristol and
the Bucks County Planning Commission with the preliminary plan application.
(Note: It would be advantageous to the applicant and the municipality to deal with
the transportation impact study at the sketch plan stage if the applicant chooses to
submit an optional sketch plan).
(2) Improvement plans shall not be submitted to PennDOT until the plans have been
reviewed by the Bristol Township Planning Commission and the Bucks County
Planning Commission and approved by Council. This submittal to PennDOT shall
be accompanied by the comments, if any, of the Township and the County
Planning Commission.
G. Implementation. The Bristol Township Planning Commission, the Bucks County
Planning Commission, the Bristol Township Engineer and Council shall review the
impact study to analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will occur due
to the subdivision or land development. Council may decide that certain improvements
on or adjacent to the site are mandatory for plan approval and may attach these
conditions to the approval. If the municipality concludes that additional improvements
are necessary, the developer shall have the opportunity to resubmit alternative
improvement designs for approval.

Completion of Required Improvements; Dedication; Contracts; Security
§ 177-79. Completion of required improvements.
When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, Council shall furnish the
developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent
upon the developer obtaining satisfactory financial security. The final plan or record plan shall
not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed.
§ 177-80. Acceptable security.
A. No plan shall receive final approval unless the streets shown have been improved to a
permanently passable condition, or improved as may be required by this chapter and any
walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary
sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may be required by this chapter have
been installed. In lieu of the completion of any improvements as may be required by this
chapter, the developer shall furnish to the Township financial security with such surety as
Council shall approve, in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements
or common amenities, including but not limited to roads, stormwater detention and/or
retention basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be required.
38. Editor's Note: See Ch. 205, Zoning.
177:99 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-80 BRISTOL CODE § 177-81
B. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the Township may
approve, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered
lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this
section.
C. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial
security, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct
such business within the commonwealth.
D. Such bond, or other financial security shall provide for, and secure to the public the
completion of any improvements which may be required on or before the date fixed in
the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the
improvements.
E. The amount of financial security to be posted for completion of the required
improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days
following the date scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the Township
may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion of
the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after either the original
date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said
adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post additional security in order
to assure that the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this section.
177-81. Amount of security.
A. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such
cost. The Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the
Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified
by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
B. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date of
posting of the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of
financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period
beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount not
exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on
177:100 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-81 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 177-83
or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above bidding
procedure.
§ 177-82. Completion in stages or phases.
A. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, Council may
authorize submission of final plans by section or stages of development subject to such
requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
B. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the
financial security may request Council to release, from time to time, such portions of the
financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to Council, and the Township shall
have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Township Engineer
to certify, in writing, to Council that such portion of the work upon the improvements
has been completed in accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification,
Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an
amount as estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if Council fails to act within the forty-five-day period,
Council shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. Council
may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by the Township
Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
C. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements
required as a condition for the final approval of a plan as set forth in this section, the
municipality shall not condition the issuance of building, grading, or other permits
relating to the construction of the improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or
land as depicted on the final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld
following: the improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public
roads to such building or buildings to a permanently passable condition, as well as the
completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the approved plan, either upon
the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary
for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
§ 177-83. Maintenance guaranty.
A. Where Council accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements following
completion, Council may require the posting of financial security to secure structural
integrity of the improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term not
to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security
shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this section with regard to installation
of such improvements, and the amount of this financial security shall not exceed 15% of
the actual cost of installation of the improvements.
177:101 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 177-83 BRISTOL CODE § 177-84
B. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or facilities related
thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of a public utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the Township,
financial security to ensure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise required by this
section.
§ 177-84. Release from improvement bond.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements,
the developer shall notify Council, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the improvements and shall send a copy to the Township Engineer. The
Township shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the improvements. The Township Engineer shall file
a report with Council, and shall mail a copy of the report to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Township Engineer of the authorization from the Township. This report shall indicate
approval or rejection of the improvements, and if the improvements, or any portion
thereof, shall not be approved by the Township Engineer, this report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Township shall notify the developer, within 15 days of receipt of the Township
Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail of their actions in response to
the Township Engineer's review of improvements.
C. If the Township or the Township Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation
provisions, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the developer
shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.
D. If any portion of the improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by Council,
the developer shall proceed to complete the improvements and, upon. completion, the
same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred for the inspection of such improvements. Such
reimbursement shall be based upon a schedule adopted by resolution and shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the
Township Engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in the
Township, and in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the Township
Engineer or consultant to the Township when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on applicants. In the event that the applicant disputes the amount of such
expense in connection with inspection of improvements, the procedure set forth in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as amended), Section 510(g),
Subsections (1) through (5),39 shall be adhered to.

§ 177-85. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been installed as
provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final plan, Council is hereby granted
the power to enforce any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security,
Council may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by
such security, and not for any municipal purpose.
§ 177-86. As-built plans.
After completion and municipal approval of subdivision or land development improvements
as shown on final plans, and before municipal acceptance of such improvements, the
developer shall submit to Council a corrected copy of said plans showing actual dimensions
and conditions of streets and all other improvements, certified by an engineer or surveyor to
be in accordance with actual construction. As-built plans for individual lots shall also be
provided to the Township.

A LANDSCAPE STRATEGY FOR DETENTION BASINS
Prepared For The Supervisors of
Lower Makefield Township, Pennsylvania

Introduction
In response to state legislation regulating runoff from sites undergoing construction, many developers
have constructed stormwater detention basins. These basins, ranging in size from a few thousand square
feet to several acres, are now a common sight in new housing developments where they constitute a
continuing maintenance problem.
Because of the extensive grading required to create a basin, the fmished site usually consists of exposed
subsoil in a disturbed condition. Berms surrounding the basins are subject to erosion. Cement aprons at
inlet and outlet pipes are an attempt to reduce washouts at these points as is the use of special paving
surfaces at emergency spillways.
In Lower Makefield Township, most completed detention basins have been seeded with grass and are
mowed every few weeks during the growing season, a fairly expensive solution to the maintenance
problem. Because of the soil conditions, grass establishment has been uneven, allowing for continued
erosion problems. Several basins have natural wet areas which cannot be mowed. One is actually a
retention basin with a permanent pond surrounded by a secondary basin. In all areas, periodic flooding is
a factor which must be considered, although inundation for more than a few hours is unusual.
We have approached the problem of developing a landscape design for a typical detention basin with the
following goals in mind:
1. The mature landscape should not have a negative effect on the hydrological function of the basin.
2. The landscaped basins should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the surrounding land
use.
3. The landscaped basins should require a minimum of maintenance once the original plantings have
become established.
The basic concept on which we have based our plan involves the creation of a mixed meadow of native
or naturalized grass species and compatible wild flowers. After an initial period of establishment, a single
annual mowing should be adequate to maintain the meadow. Where basins adjoin existing woodland or
hedgerows, we have suggested planting appropriate trees and shrubs in a naturalistic manner to blend in
177 Attachment 1:1 06-15-2005
BRISTOL CODE
with the surroundings. We also suggest the use of selected trees and shrubs at sites within the basins for
visual interest, shade, wildlife habitat and screening. Difficult areas such as steep slopes and stream and
pond edges have also been addressed.
This report includes lists of plants for each situation including nursery sources.
Basin Floors
In the detention basin floors, an established meadow of native and naturalized wildflowers and grasses
would provide a pleasing, low-maintenance landscape. Two types of meadow situations exist: basin
floors which are usually well-drained, but subject to occasional flooding, and permanently wet areas.
Each area requires somewhat different plant species, but there is considerable overlap.
A typical meadow mix includes wildflowers and prairie or meadow grasses. Clump-forming, as opposed
to mat-forming grasses should be used to allow space for the wildflowers to fill in, and because they are
more ornamental. Suggested wildflowers and grasses and their sources are listed in the appendix.
To save on seeding time and labor costs, and for areas too wet to work with equipment, we recommend
hydroseeding, the application of a slurry of seed and water to the soil. The slurry may also contain
fertilizer and wood fiber; then the technique is called hydromulching. The wood fiber helps to hold the
seed in place until germination occurs.
Because of the extensive grading involved in creating a detention basin, the floor usually consists of
subsoil, and a soil test by a reputable laboratory should be taken to determine the nutrient requirements.
The recommended amount of fertilizer which can be added to the seed/water slurry, should be a
conventional "fast release" form so it is available to the germinated seedlings. The preferable times for
meadow seeding are April 1 to May 1, and September 1 to October 1. A table of wildflower and grass
seeding rates is included in the appendix.
Meadow grasses and wildflowers require two years for good establishment. To discourage annual weeds
during the initial period, a quick, short-lived, relatively noncompetitive nurse crop such as wild Canadian
rye, Elvmus canadensis, is recommended. During the first two years, three mowings per year at a height
of eight inches may be necessary to discourage weedy invaders, while allowing the meadow plants to
establish themselves. After establishment, one annual mowing in either late fall or early spring should be
sufficient to maintain the meadow.
Wet Edges
In areas that remain wet all or most of the time, a mixture of woody and herbaceous swamp species is
appropriate. Pond banks and stream edges can be stabilized by such herbaceous plants as cattails, reed
canary grass, bulrushes, swamp rose mallow, purple loosestrife, or swamp smartweed, or woody species
such as bald cypress, blackgum, sweetgum, shadbush, river birch, red osier dogwood and winterberry
holly.
Playing Fields
Relatively level areas in or around the detention basin might be utilized as playing fields by the
neighboring children. Because of the nature of the basin, it would not be appropriate for highly organized
sports, but it would be suitable for activities like touch football, frisbee games and kite flying.
177 Attachment 1:2 06 -15 - 2005
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
In existing basins, these should be located on the higher end of the basin away from the drainage pipe.
New basins could be designed so the playing field is at a slightly higher elevation than the lowest point of
the basin. Through proper engineering, the playing field could be well drained most of the time, being
flooded only briefly by heavier rainstorms. In most cases, the field would again be usable three or four
days after being flooded.
The playing field surface should be evenly graded and covered with at least three inches of topsoil
stockpiled from the site before construction. Soil tests should be taken and the required amendments
added to ensure quick establishment of the turf, thereby preventing erosion. The seeding mix should
consist of a mixture of 25 pounds of Kentucky Fescue 31, plus five pounds of perennial ryegrass per acre.
Straw mulch or hydromulching is critical in preventing erosion and protecting the young grass seedlings.
Once established, the playing field will require mowing at two-and-one-half-inch height every two weeks
in the spring and every three weeks thereafter. Because of the mowing required, playing fields should
only be installed in neighborhoods where such a facility is needed, and where use justifies the periodic
mowing.
Wooded Areas
Where detention basins adjoin wooded areas, we suggest the planting of trees and shrubs selected to
blend in with the surroundings. These plantings might be used to extend a woodland edge down the bank
of a basin, or to continue an existing hedgerow part way around the basin. In such areas, plantings should
be of sufficient density to eliminate the need for mowing. In addition, scattered clusters of trees and
shrubs might be located within the basin for aesthetic interest, to create shaded areas, to provide wildlife
habitat, and for wind control or visual screening. Plants to be located within the basins should be selected
from the list of trees and shrubs tolerant of wet soils; those for planting on rims or banks should be
species tolerant of dry soil conditions (see appendix).
Deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted during the spring (late March to mid-May) or fall (early
October until the ground freezes). Tulip poplar, magnolias, and sweetgum are exceptions which should
only be planted in the spring. Evergreens are best moved in late summer or early fall (mid-August to late
September). The Township should encourage the contractor to wait for the proper season for planting,
but it may be advisable to require a performance bond to cover the work.
For this type of planting we recommend trees of one- to one-and-one-half-inch caliper, and shrubs in the
two- to three-foot size range. Balled and burlapped, nursery stock is generally preferred, however, with
careful handling, bare root plants may be very satisfactory and considerably less expensive. Bare root
nursery stock must be planted in the early spring while the trees are still dormant, or late in the season
after winter dormancy has set in.
A detail drawing is attached (see appendix), showing planting procedures for balled and burlapped stock.
Placement of the top of the root ball three to four inches above the original soil line is important to the
successful establishment of trees in wet areas. Heavy mulching will prevent excessive drying between
rains.
Slopes
Slopes require special attention due to the problem of erosion. Where slopes are gentle, a mixture of
meadow grasses and wildflowers as recommended for basin floors, is suggested. Wherever possible,
slopes should be limited to 15 percent grade. This not only decreases the erosion potential, but also
allows for periodic mowing.
177 Attachment 1:3 06 - 15 - 2005
BRISTOL CODE
Where slopes are steeper we suggest the use of herbaceous groundcovers such as crown vetch (Coronilla
varia), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), or tiger lilies (Hemorocallis fulva). If crown vetch or
birdsfoot trefoil are seeded, a nurse crop such as perennial rye will be necessary to provide cover while
the permanent plants become established.
Dense spreading shrubs are also suitable cover on steep slopes or where you wish to limit access, for
instance, around inlet and outlet pipes. Species for this purpose are identified by an asterisk on the list of
shrubs tolerant of dry soils included in the appendix. A heavy mulch should be used during the period of
establishment of shrub plantings.
Screen Plantings
With a landscape management plan for the entire detention basin area, complete perimeter screening of
the site may not be necessary or desirable. Presently, entire sites are often screened with a line of White
Pines around the basins. Though this is an effective buffer, rows of White Pine do not complement the
existing landscape, nor do they make the most of attractive open spaces which often adjoin the detention
basin. Furthermore, the use of only one species could lead to serious problems if a new insect or disease
should become prevalent.
Early in the design phase, the site should be reviewed to determine both the assets and liabilities of the
property. Unsightly views to be hidden, as well as good views to be preserved, should be identified.
Screen plantings should consist of clusters of evergreens interspersed with groupings of deciduous trees
and shrubs. Deciduous plants should be chosen to add flowers and ornamental diversity to the landscape,
as well as provide food and shelter for wildlife. Native plants or plants with a naturalistic appearance
should be used whenever possible.
Evergreens in a single cluster should all be the same species, but on any given site, several evergreen
species should be used to ensure that the entire stand is not eliminated by a single insect or disease
problem. Size of the clusters could vary from three to fifteen plants depending on the scale of the project.
These should usually be planted in staggered curvilinear fashion to match the form of the land. Large
evergreen trees like White Pine should not be planted closer than fifteen feet on center. If a high
percentage of immediate opacity is required, increase the depth of the planting.
Refer to the appendix for lists of evergreen and deciduous plants suitable for screening.

tax upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation during the fiscal year. Each

exemption certificate with the Tax Collector and with the person's employer affirming
that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all
sources within the political subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have attached to
it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the
Township for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the local services tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Tax Collector, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms
are readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with
a form at the time of hiring.
(1) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the local services tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the Tax
Collector that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar
year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within that
political subdivision in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person under
Subsection D(2).
(2) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the local
services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection
D(1), the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under Subsection D(1), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll
period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the
tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall
180:16 05 - 15 - 2008
§ 180-44 TAXATION § 180-45
be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the Township levying the tax

employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates,

exempting any employee from a local services tax.
§ 180-45. Collection through employer.

Township but who engage in business within the Township, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his/her employees engaged by him/her or
performing for him/her with the Township and making a return and payment thereof to
the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata share of the tax
for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata
share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by
dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro
rata share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll
period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a
payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation, except as provided in Paragraph D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the
school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than one
Township/Borough during each payroll period.

if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes
the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax
withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other employers of a change
in principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's
statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of
the number of townships/boroughs within which a person may be employed. The
Township shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the
withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of
180:17 05 - 15 - 2008
§ 180-45 BRISTOL CODE § 180-48
employment, the employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax
in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies
with the provisions of § 180-44D of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the end of
each quarter of a calendar year.
H. Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on forms
to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails to file the return and
pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages
or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this
article, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the
tax had been originally levied against the employer.
I. In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to determine the
number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter of each
such tax year.
§ 180-46. Direct payment by taxpayer.
Every taxpayer who is self-employed or whose tax for any other reason is not collected under
§ 180-45 of this article shall file a return on a form prescribed by the Tax Collector and shall
pay the tax directly to said Collector. Each such taxpayer who first becomes subject to the tax
after the effective date of this article and on or before March 31 of the then current tax year
shall file the return and pay the tax on or before April 30 of the current tax year, and each
such taxpayer who first becomes subject to the tax after March 31 of the current tax year shall
file the return and pay the tax on or before July 31 or October 31 of the current tax year or
January 31 of the following year, whichever of such payment dates first occurs at least 30
days after the taxpayer becomes subject to the tax.
§ 180-47. Applicability.
Both resident and nonresident taxpayers shall, by virtue of engaging in an occupation within
the Township of Bristol, be subject to the tax and the provisions of this article.
§ 180-48. Administration and enforcement.
The Tax Collector shall collect and receive the taxes, interests, fines and penalties imposed by
this article and shall maintain records showing the amounts received and the dates such
amounts were received. The Tax Collector shall prescribe and issue all forms necessary for
the administration of the tax and may adopt and enforce regulations relating to any matter
pertaining to the administration of this article. The Tax Collector and agents designated by
him may examine the records of any employer and/or supposed employer or of any taxpayer
in order to ascertain the tax due or verify the accuracy of any return. Every employer or
supposed employer and every taxpayer or supposed taxpayer shall give the Tax Collector and

§ 180-48 TAXATION § 180-51
any agent designated by him all means, facilities and opportunity for the examinations hereby
authorized.
§ 180-49. Collection by Tax Collector; interest and penalties; overpayment; refunds.
The Tax Collector shall collect, by suit or otherwise, all taxes, interests, costs, fines and
penalties due under this article and unpaid. If for any reason any tax is not paid when due,
interest at the rate of 6% per year on the amount of unpaid taxes and an additional penalty of
1/2 of 1% of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction of month during which
the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected. Whenever suit is brought for the
recovery of unpaid tax, the taxpayer shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection as
well as for interest and penalties. The Tax Collector may accept payment under protest of the
tax claimed by the Township of Bristol in any case where any person disputes the Township's
claim for the tax. If a court of competent jurisdiction thereafter decides that there has been
overpayment to the Tax Collector, the Tax Collector shall refund the amount of the
overpayment to the person who paid under protest. Any action instituted for such judicial
determination shall be instituted within two years of the last day of the period for which the
tax is disputed or claim made. All refunds shall be made in conformity with the procedure
prescribed by the court.
§ 180-50. Violations and penalties.
An employer or taxpayer who makes a false or untrue statement on any return required by this
article, or who refuses inspection of his records in his custody and control setting forth his
employees subject to this tax, or who fails or refuses to file a return required by this article, or
who violates any other provisions of this article, shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced
to pay a fine of not more than $600, plus costs of prosecution, and in default of payment of
such fine and costs, shall be imprisoned for a term not to exceed 30 days.

of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political
subdivision shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Council under the authority of that Act shall, during
the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be
1/2 of the rate and such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
Council; provided, however, that the Council and any other political subdivision which
impose such tax on the same person or transfer may agree that instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local
Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in effect at the time the
tax is due shall be added and collected.
§ 180-54. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities, agencies or political
subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax imposed by this article. The exemption
of such governmental bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from
liability for the tax.
180-55. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by § 180-51 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities, agencies or

transfer previously recorded but which does not extend or limit existing record
legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration of property

the parties take shares greater in value than their undivided interest, tax is due on
the excess.

husband and wife but who have since been divorced, provided that the property or
interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or
husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or spouse of a
brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a brother or sister, and

intestate succession from a personal representative of a decedent to the decedent's
devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an ordinary trust
where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if the transfer was made
directly from the grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such
beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of the trust
instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a beneficiary of
an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a successor

were his principal, no tax would be imposed under this article. Where the
document by which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set
forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of his
principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is the property of the

conditions upon which the permit has been issued are being or have been violated. The
Commission may, in its discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuing of the permit,
require the applicant to file a bond satisfactory to the Commission or to deposit securities
satisfactory to it to guarantee the compliance by the applicant with the terms and conditions
upon which the permit is issued.
§ 186-4. Enumeration of regulations.
The following regulations shall, from the adoption of this article, be the regulations of the
Bristol Township Shade Tree Commission and shall be enforced by the aforesaid

on a tree or tree guard; or to injure, misuse or remove any device placed to protect shade
trees, except in case of immediate necessity for protection of life or property.
B. No shade tree shall be planted on any public highway, street or road in Bristol Township

be planted. The Commission may refuse a permit to plant any species of tree which in its
opinion is not suited to the location.
C. No person shall fasten a horse or other animal to any shade tree or cause or permit a
horse or other animal to stand so that such horse or animal can injure any shade tree.

after the expiration of the date specified in said notice, cause such trimming to be done at
the expense of the owner and the entire cost thereof shall be a lien upon said premises

cement or other substance which shall impede the passage of water and air to the roots of
186:2 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 186-4 TREES § 186-6
any shade tree unless such person shall leave an open space of ground surrounding the
trunk of the tree, such space to be not less than four feet square.
F. In connection with any building operation or the performance of any work whatsoever in
the Township in the vicinity of any shade trees, before any such work shall be
commenced, guards shall be placed at all shade trees which may be affected by such
work so as to effectually prevent injury to them.
G. No person shall pour saltwater, oil or other materials at any place in such a manner that
injury may result to any shade tree.
H. No person shall, without first obtaining a permit therefor, attach any electric wire,
insulator or any device for the holding of an electric wire to any shade tree.
I. Every person having any wire or wires charged with electricity running through a public
highway shall securely fasten such wire or wires so they shall not come in contact with
any tree so as to injure the same.
J. Whenever in order to take down or prune any shade tree in the public highway or having
branches extending over the public highway, it shall be deemed necessary to remove any
wire or wires, every person having any such wire or wires running through a public
highway shall temporarily remove the same or cut off the flow of current therefrom

use of certain motorized vehicles in the nature of motorcycles, minibikes and mopeds (defined
as "motorcycles," "motor-driven cycles" and "motorized pedalcycles" in the Pennsylvania
Vehicle Code' ) upon certain private and public property constitutes a severe annoyance,
nuisance and hazard to persons and property; and whereas the operation of said vehicles on
the places other than public highways is not otherwise regulated by statute or ordinance it is
therefore deemed appropriate and necessary to establish the following regulations.

by the Township) and, at the request of the Township, shall be filled under its
direction and supervision; and any such facility not so abandoned and, if required
by the Township, filled, shall constitute a nuisance and such nuisance shall be
abated as provided by law at the expense of the owner of such property.

connection charge and tapping fee imposed by the Authority and any inspection fee
imposed by the Township.
C. No person other than the Township or its agents shall make or cause to be made the

connect to a service connection.
(2) Such person shall apply for and obtain a permit as required by this chapter.
(3) Such person shall have given the Township at least 24 hours' notice of the time
when such service line is to be connected and such connection made so that the

necessary testing.
D. All costs and expenses of construction of a service line and all costs and expenses of
connecting such service line to a service connection shall be borne by the owner of the
property to be connected; and such owner shall indemnify and save harmless the
Township and the Authority from all loss or damage that may be occasioned, directly or
indirectly, as a result of the construction of a service line or the connection of a service
line to a service connection.
E. Whenever the surface of any public street, sidewalk or cartway is disturbed by the
construction of a service line, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant for a
connection to obtain street opening permits from the Township or highway occupancy
permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Unless otherwise required,

§ 205-9. Statement of community goals and objectives.
The following statement of community goals and objectives is designed to guide growth and
development in Bristol Township. These goals and objectives are identified in the Bristol
Township Comprehensive Plan. This statement is in compliance with the requirements of
Section 606 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as amended).4
A. Land use policy.
(1) Attract new industry and create new tax ratables in the light industrial, office, and
retail service sectors of the Township's economic base through the development of
light industrial uses, planned industrial parks, planned office parks, and
consolidated areas of new retail development.
(2) Redevelop lands which were formerly utilized on a low-density basis for
manufacturing and transportation (airport property) and to reprogram the
reutilization of these sites as productive industrial and business parks.
(3) Reinforce the existing, clearly established residential neighborhoods within the
Township and to provide adequate services and support facilities for present and
future residents of these neighborhoods. The existing system of community
facilities serving the Township, which includes schools, parks, recreational
facilities, churches, and semipublic organizations, is proposed for retention and
limited expansion.
(4) Components of the Community Facilities Plan, which are lacking in the Township,
include a community center, municipally owned and controlled park lands at
strategic locations, adequate expansion for the Township Building, and a
municipally owned or controlled boat launch site on the Delaware River.
(5) Limit growth of strip commercial uses along major Township thoroughfares. The
consolidation of commercial uses at primary present locations is proposed for
continuance in a more clearly defined manner.
(6) The Proposed Land Use Plan designates a substantial amount of property located
in the vicinity of the Route 413-Bath Road and Durham Road intersection,

205:9 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-9 BRISTOL CODE § 205-9
encompassing both existing commercial activities and proposed commercial
redevelopment in the form of a new shopping center(s) reutilizing lands which are
presently zoned for retail use but underutilized.
(7) The protection of environmentally sensitive areas and remaining open space is a
primary goal of the Bristol Township Comprehensive Plan. The plan formally
designates environmentally sensitive areas with the intent of limiting developers to
respect this critical resource.
B. Residential land use.
(1) Goal: The basic residential land use goal is to provide and maintain a healthy, safe,
attractive, and stimulating environment in which all segments of the present and
future population may enjoy a complete life.
(2) Objectives:
(a) Provision of safe and convenient access to
recreational, and cultural activities.
(b) Protection of living areas from smoke, noise,
nuisances.
shopping, employment,
air pollution and other
(c) Provision of a variety of housing types in terms of price, location, structure
type, and tenure in suitable locations to meet the varying needs of all
families.
(d) Provision of adequate living space, especially in terms of open space.
(e) Maintenance of the older housing stock so as to prevent physical
deterioration of structures, prevent overcrowding of dwelling units and
prevent overall neighborhood decline.
(f) Protection of floodplain areas in residential and nonresidential development
and avoidance of development in areas of excessive slopes unless proper
consideration is given to the problems of development.
C. Commercial land use.
(1) Goal: The commercial land use goal is to encourage and strengthen a viable
amount of various types of well-located, well-designed commercial developments
with primary emphasis on safety, convenience and attractiveness.
(2) Objectives:
(a) Consolidation of older, declining ribbon commercial development into more
clustered centers of high-intensity use so as to reduce traffic hazards and
enhance convenience.
(b) Encouragement of the separation of commercial traffic from through traffic
by controlling ingress and egress points, and by requiring off-street parking
and loading facilities.
205:10 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-9 ZONING § 205-9
(c) Encouragement of the growth of those commercial uses which serve the
community, with special emphasis on the conversion of buildings to office
and professional service uses at appropriate locations.
D. Industrial land use.
(1) Goal: The basic industrial land use goal is to encourage and strengthen those
industries which are of greater benefit than harm to the community.
(2) Objectives:
(a) Separation of industrial and residential areas from each other so as to prevent
either from blighting the other.
(b) Strict control of undesirable influences of industry (smoke, odor, noise) so as
to prevent hazards to the public health and safety by such means as
performance zoning standards.
(c) Encouragement of the expansion of existing industry and the attraction of
new industry to the Township.
(d) Encouragement of the reutilization of former heavy industrial complexes and
their conversion to functional and attractive new industrial parks.
E. Circulation.
(1) Goal: To achieve a safe, efficient, rapid, and pleasant circulation system for both
necessary and pleasure trips incorporating a variety of modes, including vehicular,
bicycle, horseback, and pedestrian travel.
(2) Objectives:
(a) Review of all development proposals for appropriate vehicular access in
keeping with road classifications and access guidelines set up by the
Circulation Element of the Comprehensive Plan.
(b) Development of a plan for a network of recreational paths, accommodating
pedestrians and bicycles traversing Bristol Township, primarily following
floodplains, drainage areas, the Delaware Canal, and other defined open
space corridors.
(c) Encouragement of improvements to public transportation systems, including
SEPTA bus routes and improvements to commuter rail stations.
F. Recreation land use.
(1) Goal: The major recreation goal is to provide adequate parks and recreation
facilities for all age groups and interests.
(2) Objectives:
(a) Construction of a centrally located community center for use by all citizens
of all age groups in Bristol Township.

§ 205-109 ZONING § 205-109
required shall be determined by the type of use proposed and the adjacent uses or streets
surrounding the proposed development.
B. To determine the required buffer yard and planting schedule, a three-step procedure
should be followed:
(1) Step 1, Site Analysis and Determination of Buffer Yard Class: For each property
boundary, the applicant shall determine the adjacent land use. Land use
information shall be determined by an on-site survey. Table 1 specifies the buffer
yard class for each boundary.34 The applicant shall match the proposed land use
with the corresponding adjacent land use for each property boundary. The letter
indicates the buffer yard class.
(2) Step 2, Selection of the Planting Option for the Buffer Yard Class: After
determining the buffer yard class, the applicant shall select a planting option from
Table 2.35 For each buffer class, several planting options are available, one of
which the applicant shall select to meet the buffer yard requirement for each
boundary.
(3) Step 3, Selection of the Plant Materials From the Plant Materials List: For each
planting option, any of the plant materials outlined in Table 336 may be utilized.
Minimum plant size, given either in height or in caliper, is indicated on this table.
Council may permit other plant types if they are hardy to the area, are not subject
to blight or disease, and are of the same general character and growth habit as
those listed in Table 3. All plant material shall meet the standards of the American
Association of Nurserymen. The applicant shall not be required to provide a buffer
yard should existing planting, topography, or man-made structures be deemed
acceptable for screening purposes by Council or the Zoning Officer.
C. General requirements.
(1) Location of buffer yard.
(a) The buffer yard shall be measured from the property line or the near street
line where a street serves as the property line. Where the property of a
proposed use adjoins or abuts an existing paper street that has not been
officially dedicated, the buffer yard shall be measured from the proposed near
street line of the paper street.
(b) The buffer yard may overlap the required front, side or rear yards and, in
case of conflict, the larger yard requirements shall apply.
(c) The buffer yard may be part of the lot area assigned to a dwelling unit;
however, the portion of the lot area containing the buffer yard must be in
addition to the required minimum lot area. A deed restriction shall be placed
on the lot in accordance with § 205-141 of this chapter.
34. Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
35. Editor's Note: Table 2 is included at the end of this chapter.
36. Editor's Note: Table 3 is included at the end of this chapter.
205:147 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-109 BRISTOL CODE § 205-109
(d) No more than 30% of required open space area shall be located in the buffer
yard.
(2) All buffer yards shall be maintained and kept clean of all debris, rubbish, weeds
and tall grass.
(3) No structure, sign, manufacturing or processing activity, commercial activity,
parking, or storage or display of materials shall be permitted in the buffer yard.
(4) Existing buffer: All existing deciduous and coniferous trees larger than two inches
in caliper and/or six feet in height may be considered to contribute to the definition
of an existing buffer on the property. If the amount of existing plant material that
size or greater equals any of the planting requirements, the equivalent reduction of
required plant material may be taken. In all cases, existing plant material of the
above caliper and height shall be preserved in any buffer yard except where
clearance is required to insure adequate sight distance. Any removal shall, where
feasible, involve relocation rather than clearing.
(5) Plant materials shall be permanently maintained and any plant material which does
not live shall be replaced.
(6) Planting design: It is encouraged that plant materials in buffer yards be planted in
natural clusters that will give privacy but do not block views or vistas. The
exception shall be commercial or industrial uses bordering residential uses. Here a
dense, visual screen is required. Thus, plant material shall be at least four feet high
when planted and be of such species as will ultimately produce a screen at least
eight feet high.
(7) The plant material shall be so placed that at maturity it will be no closer than three
feet from any property or street line.
(8) A clear sight triangle shall be maintained at all street intersections and at all points
where private accessways intersect public streets in accordance with § 205-128.
(9) The screen planting shall be broken only at points of vehicular or pedestrian
access.
(10) Prior to the issuance of any building permit, complete plans showing the
arrangement of all buffer yards and the placement, species and size of all plant
materials to be placed in such buffer yard shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer
to ascertain that the plans are in conformance with the terms of this chapter.
(11) All berms incorporated into the design of landscape planting for required buffer
yards shall have slopes ratios of three horizontal to one vertical.
D. Special buffer yard requirements: The following requirements shall supersede the buffer
yard requirements of Table 1: Determination of Buffer Yard Class.
(1) Buffer yard requirements along expressway and arterial streets.
(a) Where a residential use is proposed adjacent to an expressway or arterial
street, a Class "C" buffer yard shall be provided.
205:148 06 -15 - 2005
§ 205-109 ZONING § 205-110
(b) No screen planting shall be required along expressway or arterial streets
provided that:
[1] The proposed use is nonresidential;
[2] No outdoor processing, manufacturing or commercial activity and no
outdoor storage or display of material shall be so located as to be
visible from the property across the expressway or arterial street; and
[3] The front of the building faces the expressway or arterial street.

Nuisance Standards
§ 205-110. Noise.
A. Terminology. All technical terminology not defined below shall be defined in accordance
with applicable publications of the American National Standard Institute (Acoustical
Terminology, ANSI, [S1.1-1960] (R1976) with its latest approved revisions.
AMBIENT SOUND — The all encompassing noise associated with a given environment
being a composite of sound from many sources near and far, excluding the sound source.
CONTINUOUS SOUND — Any sound which is steady state, fluctuating, or intermittent
with a recurrence greater than one time in any one hour interval.
IMPULSIVE SOUND — Sound of short duration, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay
and an occurrence of not more than one time in any one hour interval.
LAND USE — The actual real use of land and buildings regardless of the zoning or
other classification attributed to such land and buildings.
NORMAL RESIDENTIAL ACTIVITIES — Any sound which is generated as a result
of an owner or occupier of a residence exercising his normal and usual right to enjoy,
maintain, repair, or improve said residence or the real property upon which the residence
is located.
SOUND SOURCE — The noise source which is being evaluated to determine its
conformance with permissible sound levels.
B. Standards. For the purpose of measuring sound in accordance with the applicable
provisions of these regulations, test equipment, methods and procedures shall conform to
the standards as published by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI, Standard
Specification for Sound Level Meters, S1.4-1971 and ANSI S1.13-1983, "Standard
Methods for the Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels") with its latest revisions or may
be done manually as follows:
(1) Observe the ambient sound on a sound level meter for five seconds and record the
best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and
lowest indications.
205:149 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-110 BRISTOL CODE § 205-110
(2) Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to provide that observations be
made at the beginning and at the end of a fifteen-minute period and that there shall
be at least as many observations as there are decibels between the lowest low
indication and highest high indication.
(3) Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications.
This value is the ambient sound level.
(4) Observe a sound level meter for five seconds with the sound source operating and
record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest
and lowest indications.
(5) Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to provide that observations be
made at the beginning and at the end of a fifteen-minute period and that there shall
be at least as many observations as there are decibels between the lowest low
indication and highest high indication.
(6) Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications.
This is the sound level of the ambient sound plus the sound source (total sound
level).
(7) If the difference between the ambient sound and the sound source is 10 dBA or
greater, the measured sound level is an accurate measurement of the sound source.
This value should be compared to the permitted sound levels. in Table 1.37
(8) Due to the logarithmic nature of sound, if the difference between the ambient
sound level and the total sound level is less than 10 dBA, a correction factor shall
be applied. The correction factors are noted in the table below:
Total Sound Level Minus Ambient
Sound Level
Correction Factor to be Subtracted
from Total Sound Level
10 0
9 1
8 1
7 1
6 1
5 2
4 2
3 3
2 4
1 7
(9) The total sound level less the correction factor is compared to the permitted sound
levels in Table 1.

(1) No person shall operate or cause to be operated within the Township any source of
continuous sound in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the
limits set forth for the receiving land use when measured at or beyond the property
boundary of the receiving land use, during the times specified in Table 1.
(2) For any source of sound which emits an impulsive sound, the excursions of sound
pressure level shall not exceed 20 dBA over the maximum sound level limits set
forth in Table 1, provided that in no case shall they exceed 80 dBA, regardless of
time of day or right or receiving land use, using the "fast" meter characteristic of a
Type II meter, meeting the American National Standard Institute specifications
S1.4-1983.

ARTICLE XXIV
Parking and Loading Performance Standards
205-118. General regulations applicable to off-street parking facilities.
A. Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence at the date of adoption of this chapter
shall not be subject to the requirements of this section so long as the kind or extent of
use is not changed, provided that any parking facility now serving such structures or uses
shall not in the future be reduced below such requirements.
B. Change in requirements.
(1) Whenever there is an alteration of a structure or an expansion of a use which
increases the parking requirements according to the standards of § 205-120,
additional parking shall be provided for the alteration or expansion in accordance
with the requirements of that section.
(2) When there is a change of use which increases the parking requirements according
to the standards of § 205-120, the total amount of parking required for the new use
shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of that section.
C. Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any use that interferes with its
availability for the parking need it is required to serve.
D. Continuing obligation. All required facilities shall be provided and maintained so long as
the use exists which the facilities were designed to serve. Off-street parking facilities
shall not be reduced in total extent after their provision, except upon the approval of the
Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception and then only after proof that, by reason of
diminution in floor area, seating area, or change in other factors controlling the
regulation of the number of parking spaces, such reduction is in conformity with the
requirements of this chapter. Reasonable precautions shall be taken by the owner or
sponsor of a particular use to assure the availability of required facilities to the
employees or other persons whom the facilities are designed to serve. Such facilities shall
be designed and used in such a manner as to at no time constitute a nuisance, a hazard,
or an unreasonable impediment to traffic.
205:155 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-118 BRISTOL CODE § 205-119
E. Joint use. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a common parking lot if
the total space provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use
individually. However, the number of spaces required in a common parking facility may
be reduced below this total by special exception if it can be demonstrated to the Zoning
Hearing Board that the hours or days of peak parking needed for the uses are so different
that a lower total will provide adequately for all uses served by the facility.
F. Location of parking spaces. Required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the
same lot or premises with the principal use served. Where a nonresidential use cannot
meet this requirement, the required off-street parking may be located within 300 feet of
the premises to which they are appurtenant; however, pedestrian access from the parking
facility to the nonresidential use shall be provided.
G. Fractional measurements. If in determining the number of required off-street parking
spaces there results a fractional space, any fraction up to and including 0.5 shall be
disregarded and any fraction over 0.5 shall require one space.
H. Maintenance of parking areas. For parking areas of three or more vehicles, the area not
landscaped and so maintained, including driveways, shall be graded, surfaced with
asphalt or other suitable material, and drained to the satisfaction of the Township
Engineer to the extent necessary to prevent dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across
streets or adjoining property. All off-street parking spaces shall be marked so as to
indicate their location. Failure to keep parking areas in satisfactory condition (i.e., free
from holes or clearly delineated) shall be considered a violation this chapter.
205-119. Reduction of nonresidential parking requirements.
In order to prevent the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than is actually
required to serve the needs of nonresidential uses, the Township Council, after consulting with
the Planning Commission and Township Engineer, may permit a conditional reduction of
parking space if the following conditions are satisfied:
A. This conditional reduction of parking shall apply to Use C3 Office Park, Use D2 Large
Retail Store, and Use F3 Wholesale Business, Wholesale Storage or Warehousing.
Township Council may permit a conditional reduction of parking for other uses where it
deems appropriate.
B. The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land development plan, must designate
sufficient space to meet the parking requirements of this chapter. The plan shall also
illustrate the layout for the total number of parking spaces.
C. The conditional reduction shall provide for the establishment of not less than 80% of the
required number of parking spaces, as specified in this chapter. The plan shall also
illustrate the layout for the total number of parking spaces.
D. The land development plan shall indicate that the maximum impervious surface ratio will
be met if the total number of required parking spaces is provided.
E. The balance of the parking area conditionally reserved shall not include areas for
required buffer yards, setbacks, or areas which would otherwise be unsuitable for parking
205:156 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-119 ZONING § 205-120
spaces due to the physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of this
chapter. This parking area which is reserved shall be located and have characteristics so
as to provide amenable open space should it be determined the additional parking spaces
are not required. The developer shall provide a landscaping plan for the reserved area
with the land development plan.
F. The developer shall enter into a written agreement with Township Council that after 18
months following the issuing of the last occupancy permit, the additional parking spaces
shall be provided at the developer's or owner's expense should it be determined that the
required number of parking spaces are necessary to satisfy the need for the particular
land development. This agreement shall apply to any future owners of the property.
G. At the time of the above-stated agreement, the developer or owner shall post a
performance bond or other securities to cover the cost of installation of the remaining
parking spaces. Eighteen months after the issuance of the last occupancy permit
Township Council, with recommendations of the Township Engineer and the Planning
Commission, shall determine if the additional spaces shall be provided by the developer
or if the area shall remain as open space.
H. Land which has been determined and designated by Township Council to remain as open
space rather than as required parking shall not be used to provide parking spaces for any
additional or expansion but shall remain as open space.
205-120. Standards for off-street parking according to use.

included within the project site for which development approval is sought. Historic
structures or resources include the following. Any structure or resource that is:
(1) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained
by the Department of Interior) or determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
meeting the requirements and eligible for individual listing on the National
Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as

National Register Bulletin 16A, U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service,
1991.
C. Any building or structure that has been identified in accordance with Subsection A above
as having national, state, or local architectural or historic significance shall be preserved
unless the applicant can demonstrate that it is in irreparable condition. Where demolition
is determined to be acceptable, the redevelopment of the property shall be undertaken in
a manner which preserves the character, front yard setback, and design of the building
removed, notwithstanding the front yard setback that may apply within the applicable
zoning district. New or reconstructed buildings shall maintain the setback of the original
building and shall maintain the architectural style, scale, bulk, and design of the original
building.
D. If a subdivision or land development is proposed for the site of any structure identified in
accordance with Subsection A above as having national, state, or local architectural or
historic significance, the lot lines of the proposed subdivision or land development shall
be drawn so as to preserve the historic context of the building, including its outbuildings,
with adequate setbacks. Setbacks should be sufficient to protect visual boundaries and
edges around the historic resources. Council may permit the alteration of lot sizes or
setbacks on other proposed lots within the same development in order to allow adequate
land area or setbacks to preserve the historic character of the historic resources, without
increasing the overall permitted density of the site.
E. No building shall be demolished except in compliance with the Bristol Township
demolition permit requirements. A permit must be granted before demolition.
F. Site plan and demolition application.
(1) In addition to the applicable requirements under the Township Building and Fire
Codes,° any applicant seeking a permit to demolish an identified historic resource

unless the applicant provides a certified engineering report regarding structural stability
of the resource that would indicate threats to public safety.
H. Passive demolition or demolition by neglect of historic resources will not be used as an
excuse by an applicant as justification for an active demolition application. Demolition
by neglect shall be considered to be the readily observable deterioration of a structure
due to lack of routine maintenance, which has detrimental effect upon the character,
stability, or structural integrity of the resource thereby constraining or negating the
structure's ability for rehabilitation or reuse.

§ 205-186. Variances.
A. Applicability. Upon appeal from a determination by the Zoning Officer, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall have the power to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter, where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of this chapter or by
reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional
situation or condition on such piece of property, the strict application of any regulation
enacted under this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional and undue hardship
upon the owner of such property, but in no other case.
B. Condition. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this chapter
shall be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances.
C. Requirements and standards.
(1) No variance in the strict application of the provisions of this chapter shall be
granted by the Zoning Hearing Board unless the Zoning Hearing Board finds that
the requirements and standards are satisfied.
(2) The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not
granted. In particular, the applicant shall establish and substantiate that the appeal
for the variance is in conformance with the following requirements and standards
listed below:
205:206 06-1s-2o05
§ 205-186 ZONING § 205-187
(a) That the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and shall not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
(b) That the granting of the variance will not permit the establishment within a
zoning district of any use which is not permitted in that zoning district.
(c) There must be proof of unique circumstances; that there are special
circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings, applying to the
land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or
conditions are peculiar to such land or building and do not apply generally to
land or buildings in the neighborhood, and that said circumstances or
conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.
(d) There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It is not sufficient proof of
hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted.
Furthermore, hardship complained of cannot be self-created; it cannot be
claimed by one who purchases with or without knowledge of restrictions; it
must result from the application of this chapter; it must be suffered directly
by the property in question; and evidence of a variance granted under similar
circumstances shall not be considered.
(e) That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the
land or building and that the variance as granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board may impose whatever conditions and safeguards it
deems necessary to insure that any proposed development or use will secure
substantially the objectives of this chapter.
D. Administration. The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in
accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in § 205-189.
E. Expiration. Unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Hearing Board, a variance shall
expire if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit or occupancy certificate, as the
case may be, within six months from the date of authorization thereof.
§ 205-187. Special exceptions.
A. Applicability. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the power to approve special
exceptions when this chapter specifically requires the obtaining of such approval and for
no other use or purpose.
B. Conditions and standards. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall make findings of fact consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall not approve a special exception except in conformance with the
conditions and standards outlined in this chapter. In denying special exceptions, the
Board shall state, in writing, the reasons for the denial. The special exception shall apply
specifically to the application and plans submitted and presented at said public hearing.

evidence that any proposed development submitted will meet all of the following
general requirements listed herein as well as any specific requirements and
standards for the proposed use. The Zoning Hearing Board shall among other
things require that any proposed use and location be:
(a) In accordance with the Bristol Township Comprehensive Plan and consistent
with the spirit, purposes, and the intent of this chapter, and Chapter 177,

(1) The Zoning Hearing Board shall render a written decision or, where no decision is
called for, make written findings on the application within 45 days after the last
hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board. Where the application is contested or

based thereon, together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on the
provisions of any Act of the commonwealth, or any ordinance, rule or regulation

(2) Where the Zoning Hearing Board fails to render its decision within 45 days or fails

for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the

the same manner as provided in Subsection A of this section. If the Zoning

916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, other than those
addressed by Council in § 205-198, and challenges to the validity of the ordinance
raising procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption
may be submitted to the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of another by an
ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires to challenge its validity on
substantive grounds shall first submit their challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board.
C. The submissions referred to in Subsections A and B above shall be governed by the
following:
(1) In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging party shall make a
written request to the Zoning Hearing Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge.
The request shall contain the reasons for the challenge.
(2) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective, as
alleged by the landowner. If a challenge heard by the Zoning Hearing Board is
found to have merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include
recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects
found. In reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall
also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies,
schools and other public service facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon
regional housing needs and effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing
units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of persons
otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance
or map;
205:212 06 - 15 - 2005
§ 205-190 ZONING § 205-190
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's soils,
slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and
other natural features;
(d) The impact of the proposal on other land uses which are essential to public
health and welfare.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board shall commence its hearings within 60 days after the request
is filed unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the ordinance or map
is in question and shall give the place where and the times when a copy of the request
may be examined by the public.
F. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board fails to commence the hearing within the time limits
set forth in Subsection D;
(2) The Zoning Hearing Board fails to act on the request on the 46th day after the
close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual
consent by the landowner and Township.
G. Where, after the effective date of this chapter, a validity challenge is sustained by the
Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to § 205-190A of this chapter or the court acts finally on
appeal from denial of a validity challenge, and the challenge so approved requires a
further application for subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two
years from the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary approval
pursuant to Chapter 177, Subdivision and Land Development. Within the two-year
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision and land
development or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which
adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the sustained validity challenge.
Where the proposal appended to the validity challenge is approved but does not require
further application under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer
shall have one year within which to file for a building permit. Within the one-year
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision and land
development or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which
adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the sustained validity challenge.
During these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the
purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
H. If the Zoning Hearing Board does not accept a landowner's challenge and a court
subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a
declaration of invalidity for the entire Zoning Ordinance and Map, but only for those
provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's challenge.

§ 205-191 BRISTOL CODE § 205-195
§ 205-191. Parties appellant before Zoning Hearing Board.

Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Township,

under § 205-187 of this chapter may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by any

decision is given as set forth in this chapter.
§ 205-193. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or any agency
or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed in accordance with Section 915.1 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.43
§ 205-194. Time limitations.
No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than 30 days after an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate
Township official, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit
the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and provides that he had no motive,
knowledge, or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his/her interest after such approval, he/she shall be bound by the knowledge of
his/her predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from
the adverse decision by the Zoning Officer or a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or
map shall preclude an appeal from a final approval.

curative amendment proposal, and the proposal so approved requires a further
application for subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two
years from the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary approval
pursuant to Chapter 177, Subdivision and Land Development. Within the two-year
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision and land
development or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment.
(2) Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment application is approved

shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such supplemental
relief as may be necessary.
H. If Council does not except a landowner's curative amendment submitted in accordance
with this chapter, and court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's
decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity of the entire ordinance and map, but
only for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment
and challenge.
§ 205-199. Impact statement.
For any petition filed pursuant to § 205-196 of this chapter, Council at its discretion may
require an impact statement to be submitted with the petition whenever it deems necessary. A
change of zoning generally means a deviation from the previously planned growth pattern.
Such changes invariably have an impact on the community, on the environment and on taxes.
A detailed statement of these impacts shall be submitted by the applicant for any change in
zoning classification or where required for a proposed use pursuant to this chapter. Such
statement shall contain the following:
A. Bristol Township Comprehensive Plan. An analysis of the consistency of the proposed
zoning change with the Comprehensive Plan shall be presented. The analysis shall
include, but not be limited to, the compatibility with the statement of community goals
and objectives, and the impact on the land use plan, community services and facilities,
regional population and housing projections.
B. Environmental impact. An analysis of the impact on stormwater runoff, aquifer recharge,
erosion, sedimentation, wildlife habitats, scenic areas, and the general amenity of the
community. The environmental or natural features listed in § 205-108, Environmental
performance standards, shall be identified and mapped. The ability of the proposed use to
comply with the requirements of § 205-108 shall be shown. The site capacity calculations
of § 205-107 shall be completed for the subject tract.
C. Transportation impact.
(1) An analysis of the impact of the proposed zoning change on the transportation
system, both highways and public transportation, shall be provided.
(2) Where a proposed zoning change or amendment could result in traffic generation
that meets the applicability for a traffic impact study in Section 525.c of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, a transportation impact study shall
be prepared in accordance with the provisions in Section 525 of the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance. 48

APPENDIX B
Special Zoning Provisions for Areas Adjoining the Delaware Canal
The officials and citizens of Bristol Township recognize the historical significance of the
Delaware Canal for past, present, and future residents.
Bristol Township's portion of the Delaware Canal is part of the Delaware Canal's End Reach.' It
is a significant link to the canal's industrial heritage since it leads to where, until the 1930s, coal
boats entered the Delaware River for Philadelphia.
Now, and into the 21st century, with resourceful planning, there will be opportunity maintain
and restore this important landscape feature for Bristol Township.
A. Goals for Canal Enhancement Area.
The following statement of goals for the canal area shall serve as a guideline for
preserving and interpreting the Bristol Township portion of the Delaware Canal Corridor.
• To preserve the environmental, scenic, cultural, historical and recreational heritage
of the Delaware Canal for the future generations of Bristol Township;
• To maintain the Bristol Township portion of the Delaware Canal and adjacent lands
as an important link in the Delaware Canal Corridor through the shared
responsibilities of public and private property owners;
• To encourage protection of the physical integrity of the Delaware Canal
Enhancement Area in Bristol Township and to seek ways of improving access and
public enjoyment for residents;
• To develop educational information and an exhibit that tell the history of the
Delaware Canal in Bristol Township for the Delaware Canal Interpretive System;
• To conserve natural areas along the canal by providing a trail along the towpaths
for passive recreational activities such as walking, jogging, hiking, bicycling,
picnicking, and fishing;
• To seek funding for the continued repair and maintenance of the Delaware Canal in
Bristol Township through local, state, and federal government, as well as private
sources;
'As indicated in the Management Action Plan for the Delaware and Lehigh Canal National Heritage Corridor
and State Heritage Park report of 1993, "a reach is a landscape with a critical mass of resources that
contribute to the corridor's significance. The End Reach marks both the historical beginning of the corridor—
its earliest European settlement, and its physical end ..."
205 Attachment 6:1 06 - 15 - 2005
BRISTOL CODE
• To foster water quality protection and healthy wildlife habitats in the canal area by
monitoring and preventing further pollution and contamination from runoff as well
as sedimentation in the canal;
• To protect and enhance the canal overlay area through appropriate zoning and
subdivision regulations as well as with comprehensive planning policies;
To work with PennDOT and Delaware Canal State Park officials to plan and
implement safe pedestrian access along the Delaware Canal.
B. General Regulations.
(1) Delaware Canal Enhancement Area Guidelines for Regulations.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to preserve and enhance the
Delaware Canal's recreational, environmental, historical, and scenic qualities
and to ensure public access and compatible land uses along the canal.
(b) Identification of Area. These regulations shall apply to the lands within the
"Delaware Canal Enhancement Area" as delineated on the Bristol Township
Zoning Map and defined in Subsection c. below.
(c) Definitions. As used in this appendix, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated.
DELAWARE CANAL — The towpath and intended waterway of the
Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal and including all adjacent
lands, aqueducts and drainage channels owned by the Commonwealth Of
Pennsylvania as part of the "Delaware Canal State Park." For purposes of
measuring setbacks from the center of the canal, such center shall mean the
center of the channel intended to be the main waterway of the canal.

overlay area to the existing zoning districts as shown on the Bristol Township
Zoning Map.
The provisions of the zoning district in which these properties lie shall
remain in full force, except where the provisions of this section differ from
the provisions of the zoning district, in which case, the provision that is more
205 Attachment 6:2 06 - 15 - 2005
ZONING
restrictive and least permissive to an applicant, landowner, or developer shall
apply.
(2) Uses Prohibited in Canal Enhancement Area. The following uses are specifically
prohibited in the Canal Enhancement Area, in addition to any other uses that are
not specifically permitted in the underlying zoning district:

(c) Vehicle service station, vehicle body shop, or vehicle repair garage.
(d) Vehicle sales or repair.
(e) Adult entertainment or adult book store.
(f) Junkyard.
(g) Solid waste disposal or transfer facilities, including recycling collection
centers.
(3) Dimensional Requirements for the Delaware Canal and Related Canal
Enhancement Area. Lot and setback regulations for the Delaware Canal
Enhancement Area (overlay) shall be as follows, unless a more restrictive
requirement is stated elsewhere in this ordinance.
(a) All new accessory and principal buildings shall be set back a minimum of
150 feet from the center of the intended waterway of the Delaware Canal.
Furthermore, for any new land development or addition, the landowner must
provide a legal description (metes and bounds of the site) when property
boundary lines abut Delaware Canal State Park lands.
(b) During any filling, grading, dredging, or construction activity, all reasonable
efforts shall be made to leave the setback areas undisturbed.
(c) In addition, all new uses or expanded uses shall comply with the following
Township requirements in order to be eligible for a building permit.
(1) A plan for the control of erosion, sediment, and grading is required
whenever the topography and vegetation on a property will be
disturbed by the establishment or a new or expanded use.
(2) Applications for permits must provide the following:
(a) Plan of existing and proposed site features (vegetation, streams,
etc.).
205 Attachment 6:3 06 - 15 - 2005
BRISTOL CODE
(b) A topography survey.
(c) A plan of proposed improvements.
(d) Description of the soil and erosion control measures to be used.
(e) Time schedule.
(f) Grading plan showing cuts and fills, wells, septic systems.
(g) Proposed final topography.
(h) Plan for the disposition of water and runoff.
(3) Grading standards.

drainage ditch or drainage structure or the canal shall be
permitted;
(e) The applicant shall not modify, fill, excavate, or regrade the land
in any manner within five feet of the property line of the
Delaware Canal.
(Application of the following range of ratios depends on site specific provisions for
soil and water conservation and stormwater management. Applicants would be
required to submit plans for a full technical review by the Township's engineer.)
(d) Maximum building coverage for that portion of the lot within the Delaware
Canal Enhancement area, not including the canal and the Canal State Park,
shall be no more than 30 percent.
(e) Maximum impervious lot coverage for that portion of the lot shall be 65
percent.

golf course; or
[8] Is clearly necessary to allow longer rows for crop farming.
205 Attachment 6:5 06 - 15 - 2005
BRISTOL CODE
(c) Protection of Trees During Construction. Reasonable efforts shall be taken
during any construction to ensure that trees protected by this section are not
accidentally injured or removed, including root compaction by equipment
and materials, damage by equipment or change in grade level. Trees that
were required to be preserved and that were destroyed shall be replaced by
the developer with new trees with the closest trunk width that is reasonably
available, in addition to any penalty that may be exercised under this
ordinance.
(7) Erosion Control. An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required to be
submitted to the County Conservation District and the municipality for any use
involving:
(a) The disturbance of more than 20,000 square feet of ground in any calendar
year (unless another stricter requirement applies); or

of over one acre. This requirement shall not apply if such activity will
comply with an appropriate erosion and sedimentation control plan that was
approved as part of the subdivision or land development plan pertaining to
that lot or use.
As a condition of any permit or approval granted by the Township under this
ordinance, all uses are required to comply with Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection regulations controlling soil erosion and resulting
sedimentation and shall also comply with any erosion and sedimentation plan
submitted to the county conservation district and/or the municipality. Any violation
of these requirements shall be a violation of this ordinance and may be enforced by
the officer (with advice requested from the municipal engineer as the zoning officer
may determine is needed), in addition to any violation under state regulations.
(8) Buffer yards along the Delaware Canal.
(a) Buffer yard.

Detention Basins, or a retention basin that will clearly resemble a
natural pond).
(b) Standards for buffer yards.
[1] The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display, manufacturing
or processing activity, materials, loading and unloading areas, or
vehicular parking. No new driveways or streets shall be permitted in
the buffer yards except at points of ingress or egress.
[2] The zoning officer may waive the required evergreen screening if a
substantial natural berm or slope or dense vegetation will be
maintained and will be substantial enough to meet the buffer provisions
of this §, or if topographic conditions or the creation of berming by the
developer would clearly relieve the need and cause for screening.
[3] Any fence that may be constructed shall be on the inside of any
required evergreen screening.
[4] Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of evergreen (as
opposed to deciduous) trees or shrubs extending the full length of the
required buffer yard. Required plant materials shall have a minimum
height when planted of three feet. Plant materials used in the planting
screen shall be of such species, spacing and size as can reasonably be
expected to produce, within five years, a solid year-round visual screen
at least six feet in height.
Sign Regulations in Commercial and Industrial Districts Within 200 Feet of the
Delaware Canal or Scenic Road. The following regulations shall apply to any signs
within 200 feet of the centerline of the intended waterway of the Delaware Canal,
unless stricter requirements are established elsewhere in Article XXIII, or unless
clearly proven to the satisfaction of the zoning officer that such sign clearly would
not be partially or wholly visible from any portion of the Delaware Canal State
Park.
(a) Wall Signs. The area of all wall signs on any side of a building shall not be
greater than five percent of total vertical area (not including the area of any
slanted roof) of the building face on which the sign(s) is located. Such signs
shall be located on a maximum of two faces of a building. Such signs and/or
their backing shall not project above the structural roof line of the building to
which they are attached.
(b) Freestanding Sign. There shall be a maximum of one freestanding sign
structure per lot or per principal use, whichever is more restrictive, with
205 Attachment 6:7 06 - 15 - 2005
BRISTOL CODE
maximum total sign area of 20 square feet on each of two sides. This sign
structure may consist of several attached signs, within the total permitted
square footage. Such sign shall have a maximum total height of nine feet
above the surrounding average ground level.
(c). Freestanding Sign on a Mobile Stand. Freestanding signs on a mobile stand
that are not permanently attached to the ground and that could be towed from
one location to another are prohibited.
(d) Off-Premise Signs. Off-premise signs are prohibited, except for signs
specifically erected by an authorized federal, state, county or municipal entity
for a valid public purpose.
(10) Access to the Delaware Canal Enhancement Area. Township council, after
receiving the advice of the planning commission, may require a subdivision or land
development to include an appropriate bicycle or pedestrian easement, and/or to
construct an appropriate sidewalk, pathway and/or bikepath as needed to provide
access the Delaware Canal State Park from the subdivision or land development
and/or adjacent bikepaths, parks, streets, or residences.
(It is recommended that the planning commission, together with the Township's
solicitor devise an incentives program to encourage the cooperation of the
landowners near the Delaware Canal Enhancement Area to provide points for ease
of public access within walking distance to the canal. [An example would be to
provide tax relief in exchange for allowing public use of private land or to allow
landowners to post warning signs without imposing liability on the landowner.])
(11) Stormwater and Erosion Control. Proper control of stormwater runoff is essential to
prevent severe damage to the Delaware Canal from erosion. Township council
requires all proposed development in the Delaware Canal Enhancement area
overlay to be carefully reviewed by experienced professionals (Township's
engineer, together with the County Conservation District staff) to ensure proper
stormwater management and erosion control utilizing best management practices
(BMPs).
(The stormwater requirements for the Delaware Canal Enhancement Area overlay
should be compatible with the Township's subdivision and land development
regulations.)

date.
(a) The review described in this Subsection F(1) shall, at a minimum, take into
account the following:
[1] Characteristics of the existing franchisee's cable system;
[2] The state of the art;

[4] The marketplace demand for state of the art taking into account any
associated rate increases; and
[5] Any additional factors deemed relevant by mutual agreement of the
Township and franchisee.
(b) If, after conducting such a review, the Township determines that the exercise
of the state-of-the-art option may be warranted, the Township shall hold at
least two public hearings to enable the general public and franchisee to
comment and present additional evidence.
(2) If, following such hearings, Township determines that the exercise of the
state-of-the-art option is warranted, it may order the state of the art be

§ A210-9 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A210-10
implemented (the "order"). The order shall be in writing and shall set forth the
basis for the Township's decision, including a reasonable period of time for
franchisee to implement the state of the art, which implementation shall not be
required prior to the ninth anniversary of the effective date. Upon agreement, the
parties may amend this agreement accordingly. If, however, franchisee is not
willing to comply with such order, the franchisee may, within 60 days after the
Township's order:
(a) Appeal the Township's order to any court of competent jurisdiction in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; or
(b) Notify the Township pursuant to Section 626 of the Communications Act that
it wishes to commence proceedings to renew its franchise. Such notice shall
be deemed to shorten the term of the franchise such that this agreement will
expire 36 months from the date of the franchisee's notice. Franchisee shall
not be deemed to be in violation of the order or of this agreement if such
renewal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced
pursuant to the Act.
(3) If the court finds that franchisee has demonstrated Township's order is not
supported by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the record of the
proceeding from Subsection F(1) above, the court shall grant appropriate relief.
(4) "State of the art" shall mean equipment and/or facilities that:
(a) Are readily available with reasonable delivery schedules from two or more
sources of supply;
(b) Have the capability to perform the intended functions demonstrated within
cable systems with similar characteristics (including but not necessarily
limited to population, density, subscriber penetration, etc.) under actual
operation conditions for purposes other than test or experimentation; and
(c) Can be implemented by franchisee in an economically feasible manner taking
into account economic waste (i.e., early retirement of assets).
(5) Township may not initiate the state-of-the-art option, or issue any order, at a time
when franchisee is subject to effective competition as defined from time to time by
federal law.
(6) The term "state of the art" does not include equipment and/or facilities for public,
educational or governmental access.
§ A210-10. PEG channels.

for arbitration. The Chairperson of the panel shall send by certified mail written notice of
the time, date and place of the hearing to the other two arbitrators, the franchising
authority, the franchisee and legal counsel to the franchising authority and the franchisee.
F. Arbitration costs.

arbitrator appointed by the franchising authority shall be borne and paid solely by
the franchising authority. The compensation and expenses of the arbitrator
appointed by the franchisee shall be borne and paid solely by the franchisee. The
franchising authority and the franchisee shall each bear and solely pay their own
attorney's fees, expert and other witness fees and other expenses incurred in
preparing and prosecuting their respective cases. In proceedings where the record
of a public hearing of the franchising authority is to be considered by the
arbitration panel, the costs of transcribing, typing and copying the record shall be
borne and paid solely by the franchisee.
(2) The compensation and expenses of the Chairperson of the arbitration panel, rental,

A210:11 06 -15 - 2005
§ A210-13 BRISTOL CODE § A210-15
award if requested by any party to the proceeding. The award shall be issued and sent by
certified mail to the parties not later than 90 calendar days following the close of the
arbitration hearing.
H. Limitation of powers. The arbitration panel shall have no authority to add to, delete or
alter any provisions of this agreement, but shall limit its interpretation to the express
terms of this agreement. Under no circumstances shall an arbitration panel be vested with
authority or jurisdiction to determine or award monetary damages (by way of setoff,
counterclaim, directly or otherwise) or any other relief against the franchising authority
or its officers, agents or employees.
I. Award final. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be
entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
A210-14. Police powers.
The franchisee shall, at all times during the term of this agreement, be subject to the exercise
of the police power by the franchising authority and to such other lawful ordinances, rules and
regulations as franchising authority shall hereafter adopt. There is hereby reserved to
franchising authority every right and power which is required to be herein reserved or
provided by any ordinance, rule or regulation of the franchising authority, and the franchisee
shall comply with any action or requirements of franchising authority in its exercise of such
right or power heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. The franchisee shall comply with
all ordinances, codes, statutes, rules and regulations of the franchising authority, County of
Bucks, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the United States of America which are now in
effect or hereafter enacted.
A210-15. Franchise fee and performance bond.
A. Unless reduced, waived or increased by the franchising authority, franchisee shall pay to
franchising authority a franchise fee equal to 5% of annual gross revenue. Said franchise
fee may be increased at the sole and exclusive election of the franchising authority to an
amount not to exceed the maximum amount allowed by law in such increments and in
such amounts as the franchising authority may elect, upon 180 days prior written notice
to the franchisee. Franchising authority reserves the right to change such amount one or
more times and the failure to make any such election shall not constitute a waiver
hereunder.
B. "Gross revenue" means all revenue received from all sources attributable to the operation
of the cable system by the franchisee and its affiliates within the municipal boundaries of
the Township from cable service including, but not limited to, subscription fees,
additional set fees, converter fees, remote fees, late fees, installation fees, sales
commissions, pay-per-view fees, cable-related publications, sales or other commissions,
channel leasing payments, and revenue received from the sale of time or programming on
leased channels, the sale of commercial time or programs, and the revenue received from
provision of any lawful cable service. But for a decision of the franchisee not to conduct
operations directly by the franchisee, all revenues collected by an affiliate, shall be
considered gross revenue and subject to the franchise fee if such revenue reasonably
A210:12 06 - 15 - 2005
§ A210-15 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A210-15
could have been derived from operations within the Township directly by the franchisee.
Excluded are the following:
(1) The revenue of any affiliate including, without limitation, a supplier of
programming to the franchisee, but such exclusion shall apply only to the extent
that said revenue is also included in the gross revenue of the franchisee;
(2) The gross revenue of any affiliate of franchisee, which serves as representative or
agent for cable operators and which is in the business of aggregating cable
operators for the purpose of selling advertising time on cable systems, which gross
revenue is not distributed, in cash or in-kind; or in combination of cash and
in-kind, to franchisee, which exclusion, in all events, shall not exceed 60% of such
affiliate's gross revenue;
(3) Amounts collected by the franchisee from subscribers on behalf of leased access
channel programmers, but such exclusion shall apply only to the extent said
amounts are passed on by the franchisee to said programmers in toto.
(4) The revenue of the franchisee or any affiliate from the operation of a facility of a
common carrier which is subject, in whole or in part, to the provisions of Title II
of the Communications Act of 1934.
C. "Affiliate" means a person or entity:
(1) With a direct or indirect ownership interest in the subject entity of 5% or more or
controls such interest, including forms of ownership such as general, limited, or
other partnership interests, direct ownership interests, limited liability companies
and other forms of business organizations and entities but not including
corporations; or
(2) With a stock interest in the subject entity where the subject entity is a corporation
and such stockholder or its nominee is an officer or director of the franchisee or
who directly or indirectly owns or controls 5% or more of the outstanding stock,
whether voting or nonvoting; or
(3) Any entity which controls franchisee, is controlled by, or is under common control
with such person or entity.
D. The franchise fee shall be assessed on a calendar quarterly basis and shall be payable to
the franchising authority no later than 45 days after the expiration of the calendar quarter
for which payment is due. Franchisee shall file a complete and accurate verified
statement, under notarial seal, at the end of each calendar year quarter, certified as true
and correct by a representative of franchisee duly authorized to make such certification,
explaining how the payment was calculated. Said statement, in the form as may be
required by the Township, shall include information as of the last day of such calendar
quarter regarding the number of subscribers for each service tier or other cable service,
the rate charged for each, the amount of revenue collected for each during the applicable
calendar quarter and a breakdown by category of revenue from all other sources. Said
statement shall accompany each payment. Upon request by the franchising authority,
franchisee shall provide such additional information as may be reasonably required. In
A210:13 06 -15 - 2005
§ A210-15 BRISTOL CODE § A210-15
connection with the franchise fee payment due on February 14, the franchisee shall also
submit to the franchising authority, on that date or no later than six months thereafter, a
detailed statement by an officer of the franchisee verifying the accuracy of the gross
revenue and franchise fee payments for the previous fiscal year, with a detailed
breakdown for each month.
E. Upon 10 days prior written notice, franchising authority shall have the right to inspect
and copy at franchisee's offices the financial records of franchisee for the purpose of
verifying or identifying revenue owed to the franchising authority. Where in the opinion
of the franchising authority the records are reasonably necessary to verify or supplement
franchisee's records, the franchisee shall cooperate with franchising authority to request
financial records of affiliate(s) to be made available to the franchising authority which
are related to the provision of cable service to subscribers in the Township or which are
related in any way to the gross revenue attributable to the operation of the cable system
in the Township. Franchising authority shall have the right to audit and to recompute any
amounts determined to be payable under this or any other section; provided, however,
that such audit shall take place within 36 months following the close of each of
franchisee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to franchising authority as a result of
the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to franchisee by the
franchising authority, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. In the event
such audit reflects an underpayment in any such year to be 3% or more, the cost of said
audit, at the election of the franchising authority, shall be borne by the franchisee.
F. In the event that any franchise or other payment is not made or the requisite
documentation and certification is not provided on or before the applicable dates
heretofore specified, interest shall be compounded daily and set at the one-year United
States treasury bill rate existent on the date payment was due, plus three percentage
points. Any amount recomputed to reflect correct payment due shall bear interest as
described from the date such payment was originally due.
G. Bonds. Franchisee shall furnish a construction bond to the Township during the
construction of the rebuild in the amount of $150,000. Franchisee shall initially furnish a
performance bond in the amount of 1/2 the value of the franchise fee for the year prior to
the effective date of the franchise. The construction and performance bonds shall be
replenished within 10 days of use by the Township. To offset the effects of inflation, the
amounts of the performance bond provided for herein shall be increased at the end of
every three years to equal one half of the franchise fee paid for the last year of such
three-year period. Franchisee shall provide such performance bond to the Township
within 30 days of the effective date of this franchise. The construction bond shall be
provided to the Township 30 days prior to rebuilding construction. The Township shall
certify that the rebuild is completed within 45 days after requested by the franchisee.
Upon receipt of such certification, the franchisee may cancel the construction bond. The
performance bond shall be maintained during the life of the franchise, to guarantee the
faithful performance of its obligations.
A210:14 06 - 15 - 2005
§ A210-16 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A210-18
§ A210-16. Regulation.
The Township shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority in the enforcement of the
provisions of the ordinance and this franchise.
§ A210-17. Remedies.
A. Schedule of liquidated damages. Because franchisee's failure to comply with certain
material provisions of this agreement will result in injury to the Township or to
subscribers, and because it will be difficult to estimate the extent of such injury, the
Township and franchisee hereby agree that, unless otherwise addressed in this agreement
by other enforcement, the liquidated damages stated in this agreement represent both
parties' best estimate of the damages resulting from the specified injury.
B. Violations. The Township shall provide franchisee with a detailed written notice of any
franchise violation upon which it proposes to take action, and there shall be a thirty-day
period within which franchisee may demonstrate that a violation does not exist or cure an
alleged violation or, if the violation cannot be corrected in 30 days, submit a plan
satisfactory to the Township to correct the violation. If an alleged violation is proven to
exist, and no cure or action on a plan acceptable to the Township has been received by
the Township within 30 days, such liquidated damages shall be chargeable to the
performance bonds set forth in this agreement, if not tendered by franchisee within 30
days. Franchisee may petition the Township for relief with just cause. The imposition of
liquidated damages shall not preclude the Township from exercising the other
enforcement provisions of this agreement, including revocation, or other statutory or
judicially imposed penalties. Liquidated damages may be imposed as follows:
(1) For failure to complete construction, the rebuild or extend service in accordance
with franchise: $250 per day for each day the violation continues;
(2) For failure to comply with requirements for public access educational and
government channels: $150 per day for each day the violation continues;
(3) For failure to submit reports, maintain records, provide documents or information:
$75 per day for each day the violation continues;
(4) For violation of customer service standards required by this franchise, this
agreement, or by FCC regulation: $75 per day per standard violated;
(5) For violation of the books and financial records provisions of this franchise and
this agreement: up to $150 per day for each day the violation continues; and
(6) For violation of other material provisions of this franchise: up to $150 per day for
each day the violation continues.
§ A210-18. Cooperation.
In any action by the franchisee and franchising authority or representative thereof mandated or
permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely
manner, time being of the essence.
A210:15 06 - 15 - 2005
§ A210-19 BRISTOL CODE § A210-22
§ A210-19. Waiver.
The failure of the Township at any time to require performance by franchisee of any provision
hereof shall in no way affect the right of the Township thereafter to enforce the same, nor
shall the waiver by the Township of any breach of any provision hereof be taken to be a
waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision, or as a waiver of the provision itself, or as
a waiver of any other provision of this agreement.
§ A210-20. Cumulative provision.
The rights and remedies reserved to the Township by this franchise are cumulative and shall
be in addition to and not in derogation of any other rights or remedies which the Township
may have with respect to the subject matter of this franchise, and a waiver thereof at any time
shall have no effect on the enforcement of such rights or remedies at a future time.
§ A210-21. No liability.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to create civil liability by one party for the action, omissions
or negligence of the other party, or of a party's agents, employees, officers or assigns. Each
party shall be solely liable for claims against it by third parties, whether arising under the
Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 or under any other
provision of law.
§ A210-22. Notices.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a joint venture or principal/agent relationship
between the parties, and neither party is authorized to, nor shall either party act toward third
person; or the public, in any manner which would indicate any such relationship with the
other.
§ A210-25. Severability.
If any section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision of this agreement is determined to be
illegal, invalid or unconstitutional, by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any state or
federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction thereof, such determination shall have no effect
on the validity of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision thereof, all of
which shall remain in full force and effect for the term of this agreement.
§ A210-26. Transfer.
The franchise herein granted is personal to the franchisee. It cannot be transferred, leased,

the Township expressed by resolution or ordinance and then only under such conditions as
may be therein prescribed. Notwithstanding the above, upon written notice to the Township,
the franchisee may, without obtaining the prior consent of the Township, make any
assignment or transfer to any firm or corporation which franchisee controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with such person or entity.
§ A210-27. Confidential information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, all information specifically marked
by the franchisee as proprietary or confidential in nature and furnished to the Township or its
designated representatives shall be treated as confidential and its officially designated
representatives agree in advance to treat any such information as confidential and only to
disclose it to employees, agents or representatives thereof that have a need to know or in order
to enforce the provisions hereof, or shall be treated otherwise in conformity with Pennsylvania
law. The franchisee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of
Section 631 of the Communications Act.

examination.
§ A211-23. Notice of examination/consortium testing. [Amended 8-21-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-06]
The Commission shall appoint a written administrator, an oral examination administrator, a

examiner to conduct the appropriate examination required by these rules and regulations. The
Commission has the discretion to participate in a statewide or countywide examination
(“Consortium”) program designed to test police officer applicants. If Consortium testing is
utilized, the initial application for examination shall be prepared, received and processed by the
agency conducting the Consortium testing. The agency shall also administer and grade the
written examinations.
§ A211-24. Written examinations.

be informed of the date for physical fitness testing.
A211-26. Veterans preference points.
Pursuant to the Veterans Preference Act, any applicant for the position of police officer who
qualifies as a "soldier" under this Act,4 shall receive an additional 10 points on top of their
total score if that applicant had received passing scores under §§ A211-21, A211-24 and
A211-25.
A211-27. Polygraph examination.
A. Every applicant for the position of police officer shall fill out a personal data
questionnaire and undergo a polygraph examination. The Commission shall furnish each
polygraph examiner with forms upon which the examiner shall state whether any of the
applicant's responses to questions from the applicant's personal data questionnaire are
deceptive. A report on each examination shall be submitted to the Commission within
five days after the date of the examination.
B. The examiner shall ask questions based on the information contained in the personal data
questionnaire. Before administering the test, the examiner shall ask each applicant
whether there is any more information related to the personal data questionnaire which
the applicant would like to provide. This shall be a post-test review, during which the
examiner shall again ask the participant, if deception is indicated, whether there is any
information that the applicant is withholding.
C. If the examiner shall deem any of the applicant's responses to be deceptive, the examiner
must tell the applicant immediately and give the applicant an opportunity to explain,
deny or admit the deception. If the applicant denies being deceptive or if the explanation
is found unsatisfactory by the examiner, the applicant will be given the opportunity to
retake the test with a second examiner. Notice of the opportunity to retest shall be given
in writing to the applicant. The second examiner will not have access to the results of the
first test prior to readministering the polygraph. If the second examiner finds no
deception, the applicant will be considered to having passed the polygraph. If the second
examiner also finds the applicant deceptive, the applicant will be considered as having
failed the examination.
D. An applicant who has failed both tests may appeal to the Civil Service Commission for a
third examination, and the decision to give the applicant an opportunity to take a third
test rests solely within the discretion of the Commission. If the applicant is awarded an
opportunity to take a third test and passes, then the applicant will be considered as
having passed the polygraph test. If the applicant is found deceptive on a third test, the
applicant will be rejected.

background investigation on each applicant. The background investigation shall include
interviews with the applicant's family, acquaintances, current and former employers,

written recommendation to the Commission on whether the applicant is appropriate for
consideration for employment as a police officer.
C. Appropriateness of the applicant shall be based on the criteria set forth in § A211-13 of
these rules and regulations. This recommendation shall be in writing and if the
recommendation is to disqualify, then a detailed written explanation of the reasons for

§ A211-30. Creation of eligibility list.
A. At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in Article IV, written
examination, oral examination, background investigation, physical fitness test and
polygraph examination, the Commission shall rank all passing applicants on the list with
the applicant receiving the highest passing score at the top of the list and the applicant
receiving the lowest passing score at the bottom of the list. Applicants who qualify for
veterans preference points shall have those points added to their passing score prior to
being ranked on the eligibility list.
B. For promotional positions, fulfilling the performance requirements set forth in § A211-14
above is also required. In the case of tied scores, the tie will be broken by giving
preference to the applicant who submitted a final completed application first. If both tied
applicants submitted their completed applications on the same day, then the applicants
shall be ranked in alphabetical order by surname.
C. The eligibility list shall be valid for two years. from the date the Commission ranks all
passing applicants, assigns veterans' preference points and formally adopts the eligibility
list. The Commission may, at its sole discretion, by vote of the majority of the
Commission at a duly authorized Commission meeting, extend the list for an additional
year, in two six-month increments. The Commission may, in its sole discretion, void an
eligibility list at anytime for any reason.
D. In the event there is no current eligibility list at anytime, the Commission will implement
§ A211-36 of the police rules and procedures regarding provisional appointment and will
schedule a competitive examination within three months of the provisional appointment.
§ A211-31. Appointment; furloughed employees.
A. The appointing authority of the Township may fill any vacancy in an existing position in
the Police Department which occurs as a result of expansion of the police force,
retirement, resignation, disability or death by the reappointment or reinstatement of a
former employee of the Police Department who had been furloughed. Except for physical
and psychological examinations, no other testing shall be required for a furloughed
employee or a rehired or reappointed employee.
B. If no furlough list exists or if positions remain to be filled after all of the officers on the
furlough list were offered reemployment, every position, except that of Chief of Police,
shall be filled only in the following manner:
(1) The appointing authority of the Township shall notify the Commission of any
vacancy which is to be filled and request the certification of three names from the
list of eligibles.
A211:13 06 - 15 - 2005
§ A211-31 BRISTOL CODE § A211-32
(2) If three names are not available, then the Commission shall certify the name(s)
from any on the list.
(3) The appointing authority shall make an appointment from one of the three names
certified with reference to the merits and fitness of the candidates. However, for
the initial appointment to the position of Police Officer, when one of the three
applicants on the certified list is a veteran, that applicant shall be selected.
C. The appointing authority may object to one or more of the persons certified for the
reasons set forth in § A211-17 of these rules and regulations. If the candidate to whom
the appointing authority objects fails to timely exercise the rights of appeal as set forth in
§ A211-20 or if the Commission declines to uphold the appeal, the Commission shall
strike the name of that candidate from the eligibility list and certify the next highest
name for inclusion on the list of three candidates for each name stricken off.
D. Whenever the appointing authority of the Township of Bristol causes a reduction in the
number of police officers, then furloughing shall occur on a strict seniority basis, that
officer with the least seniority being first to be furloughed. In the event of furlough the
Commission shall prepare and maintain a list of all furloughed officers, together with the
position held by each officer at the time of the furlough. The names on the furlough list
shall be arranged in the order of strict seniority so that the officer with the greatest
seniority is at the top of the list and the officer with the least seniority is at the bottom of
the list. Seniority shall be determined by calculating the number of days of service with
the Bristol Township Police Department. In the event that two or more officers have
identical seniority, their names shall be arranged on the furlough list in accordance with
the order of their employment as officers from the eligible list, that officer who was
appointed earlier being placed higher on the list.
E. The Chief of Police shall be exempt from the seniority provisions pertaining to furlough
lists and may not be furloughed unless or until all the other officers in the Department
have been furloughed.
§ A211-32. Physical and psychological examinations.
After the appointing authority selects a candidate from the certified list of three for
appointment to the vacant position, that candidate shall submit to a physical examination and
a psychological examination by the appropriate medical experts. If the candidate successfully
passes the physical and psychological examinations, then that employee shall be appointed to
the vacant position of the Police Department for which the application was submitted. The
appointment shall be contingent upon successfully passing both the physical and
psychological examinations. Failure to pass either examination shall result in the candidate
being rejected from consideration. The rejected candidate may appeal this decision under
§ A211-20. The Commission shall then certify another name to be included with the two
previously certified names for consideration by the appointing authority pursuant to
§§ A211-30 and A211-31.
A211:14 06 - 15 - 2005
§ A211-33 CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION RULES AND REGULATIONS § A211-34
§ A211-33. Removal of names from furlough or eligible list. [Amended 9-2-2010 by
Ord. No. 2010-07]
A. In addition to other reasons stated as grounds for removal in these rules, the name of any
person appearing on a furlough list or an eligible list shall be removed by the Commission
is such person:
(1) Is appointed to a position in the Police Department of the Township; or
(2) Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police Department of the
Township; or
(3) Fails to make written reply to the Commission within seven calendar days from the
date of mailing of a notice of certification; or
(4) Indicates availability for employment and is appointed to fill a vacancy but fails to
report for duty at the time prescribed by appointing authority, unless, in the opinion
of the appointing authority, such person can show good and sufficient reasons for
failing to report.
(5) If a candidate’s name simultaneously appears on two promotional lists, and the
candidate is offered positions from both lists, the list from which he/she declines an
offered position will result in the candidate being placed at the “bottom” of the list from
which he/she declined the opportunity. If the candidate appears on two lists, but is only
offered a position from one list, he/she remains on the other list, in the same position,
for as long as that list remains in effect. However, once that candidate is offered a
position on the second list, during that list’s lifetime, and declines a position, then
his/her name will be placed at the bottom of the list, consistent with the procedure
referenced above. A candidate’s declining of a position on any promotional list will only
be effective once the candidate has signed and acknowledged the choice for the
particular promotion, as described, above, on a written form. Nothing herein impairs
the Police Department’s authority to remove an officer from a position, as is set forth
elsewhere in these rules. [Added 9-2-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-07]
B. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed as authorizing the removal of the name
of any person on any furlough list who accepts the position of a lower rank than that for
which he was qualified.
§ A211-34. Probationary period. [Amended 12-18-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-12]
Every successful applicant to the position of police officer or to a promotional position with the
Police Department shall serve a 12-month probationary period in that position. For newly hired
police officers, the probationary period shall not commence until after the officer has completed
training under Act 120 and receives a certification number. Newly-hired officers who have
already completed Act 120 training will commence their 12-month probationary period when
they are placed on the Township Police Department’s payroll. During the probationary period,
a newly-hired police officer may only be dismissed for cause for the reasons set forth in § A211-
17. A promoted officer, during probation, may be returned to a prior rank only for cause for
reasons set forth in § A211-17. However, at the end of the 12-month probationary period, if the
conduct of the probationer has not been satisfactory to the appointing authority, the probationer
shall be notified in writing, that the appointment will not be permanent. At that time, a newly
hired officer’s employment shall terminate, and/or those officers appointed pursuant to
A211:15 12 - 18 - 2014
§ A211-34 BRISTOL CODE § A211-36
provisional appointments as a promoted officer shall return to their pervious rank. Alternatively,
if the conduct of the probationer is neither satisfactory nor unsatisfactory, the Chief and the
Managing Director can extend the probationary period for one additional year. Any officer who
is not informed in writing that their performance has been unsatisfactory or that the
probationary period has been extended for one additional year, shall receive a permanent
appointment to the new position. Any probationer, who is certified in writing that an
appointment will not be made permanent or that the probationary period is being extended for
one additional year, has no rights of appeal under these rules and regulations.
§ A211-35. Provisional appointments.
Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling of a vacancy in any position in the Police
Department and there are no names on the eligible list for such appointment, the appointing
authority may nominate a person the Commission for a noncompetitive examination, and may
be appointed provisionally to fill such vacancy. It shall thereupon become the duty of the
Commission within three months to schedule a competitive examination and certify a list of
eligibles, and then a regular appointment shall then be made from the name or names submitted
by the Commission, provided that nothing within this section shall prevent the appointment,
without examination, of persons temporarily as police officers in cases of riot or other emergency.
ARTICLE VI
Suspensions; Removals; Reductions in Rank
§ A211-36. Grounds for disciplinary action.
A. No person appointed to a position in the Police Department pursuant to these rules and
regulations may be suspended without pay or removed, and no person promoted in rank
pursuant to these rules and regulations may be reduced in rank, except for the following
reasons:

which case the officer shall receive an honorable discharge from the service;
(2) Neglect or violation of any official duties;
(3) Violation of any law of this commonwealth which provides that such violation

statement of any charges made against any officer so employed shall be furnished to the
officer within five days after those charges have been adopted by the appointing authority.

warranting such actions shall be stated in writing by the appointing authority. Charges
shall be stated clearly and in sufficient detail to enable the officer to understand the charges
and to allow the officer an opportunity to respond to those charges. The charges shall specify
the cause set forth in § A211-36 which provides the basis for the disciplinary actions, as well
as an explanation of the factual circumstances upon which the appointing authority relied
in finding a violation of § A211-36.
B. Within five days after the appointing authority has voted to impose the disciplinary action,
a written statement of the charges shall be delivered to the officer either by personal service
or by certified and registered mail. In addition, the charges shall notify the officer of the
right to appeal of § A211-38 of these rules and regulations. A copy of the statement of
charges shall also be served upon the members of the Civil Service Commission.
§ A211-38. Hearing on suspensions, removal and reductions in rank.
A. An officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank may appeal the decision of
the appointing authority by written notice to the Secretary of the Commission at 2501 Bath
Road, Bristol PA 19007, requesting a hearing. This request must be received by the
Commission within 10 days after the officer received notice of discipline. The officer may
make written answers to any of the charges filed no later than the date fixed for the
hearing. Failure of the officer to provide written answers to any answers to any of the
charges shall not be deemed an admission by the officer.
B. The Commission shall schedule a hearing within 10 days from the officer’s written request
for a hearing unless continued by the Commission for cause at the request of the
Commission, the appointing authority or the officer. At any such hearing, the officer against
whom the charges have been made may be present and represented by counsel, may call
witnesses and present testimony and documentation in defense. The Township may also be
represented by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as necessary to support the
charges. A stenographic record of all testimony shall be taken at every hearing and
preserved by the Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record shall be
sealed and not be available for public inspection.
C. In conducting the hearing, the Commission’s standard of review shall be to determine
whether sufficient evidence has been presented to support the statutory reason for the
disciplinary action. If the Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been introduced to
support the charge(s), the Commission shall not modify the penalty imposed by the
appointing authority unless it finds that the penalty imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory
or an abuse of the appointing authority’s discretion. In considering the appropriateness of
the discipline, the Commission shall not substitute its judgment for that of the appointing
authority. The Commission may request post-hearing briefs; it shall issue a written decision
containing specific findings of fact and conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the
hearing transcript.
§ A211-39. Hearing procedures.
A. All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the Chairperson or, in the absence
of the Chair, the Vice Chairperson. The Commission shall have power to issue subpoenas
A211:17 12 - 18 - 2014
§ A211-39 BRISTOL CODE § A211-40
as set forth in § A211-9.2 above. The hearing shall be opened to the public unless, prior to
the commencement of the hearing, a written or oral request to close the hearing is made by
the charged officer or the Township.
B. If the Commission sustains the charges, the officer who is suspended, or removed or reduced
in rank, may file an appeal with the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County within 30 days
from the date of entry by the Commission of its final Order. No order of suspension shall be
made by the Commission for a period longer than one year. In the event that the
Commission fails to uphold the charges then the person sought to be suspended, removed
or demoted shall be reinstated with full pay for the period of the suspension, removal or
demotion, and no charges related to his suspension, removal or reduction in rank shall be
officially recorded in the officer’s record.
