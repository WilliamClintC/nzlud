A. 	
In order to provide for façade articulation, building facades may step back a maximum of 2’ from the build-to-line for a maximum of 30% of the building face along a block face. 

B. 	
Porches and stoops may encroach beyond the build-to-line within the private frontage for a maximum of ten (10) feet.

E. 	
The build-to-line shall be measured from the front lot line (i.e. the right-of-way line). 

F. 	
Minimum building frontage standards shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements set forth in the zone which the parcel is located in. 


Examples: 
Property Line 	Property Line 


Rear Setback 
Minimum Building Frontage 



2:2 Frontage-Type Standards 
2:2:1 	
Frontage-Type Standards.  Frontage type standards shall be applicable to all building frontages, except for along alleys. 

A. 	
Allowable Frontages per Zone: 

1. 	
Common Lawn: Allowable in RF, RT and RS zones. 

2. 	
Porch: Allowable in RF, OT, RT and RS zones. 

3. 	
Forecourt: Allowable in OT, RF, RT and C zones. 

4. 	
Stoop: Allowable in OT, RF and RT zones. 

5. 	
Awning: Allowable in OT, RF, and C zones. 

6. 	
Gallery: Allowable in OT and C zones. 




2:2:2 	
Future Development. Future development within Millersburg Borough shall attempt to mimic the existing surrounding frontages. 

A. 	
Awning frontages shall be only applicable to buildings with ground floor usages with storefronts. 

B. 	
Within RS, RT, RF and OT zones, frontage must be determined by the building frontage to either side of the parcel. The build-to line shall fall equal to the building located closest to the street of highest order. 

C. 	
All frontage types must maintain proper maintenance standards. Awnings, porches, forecourts, etc must be kept in good condition and replaced or repaired if necessary.  Landscaping along primary roads must also be kept well maintained. 


BTL 


Common Lawn: The main facade of the building has a large setback from the build-to-line. The resulting front yard can be defined or undefined at the build-to-line. This edge is typically defined by a fence or hedge within a traditional neighborhood or undefined within the more rural areas or subdivisions. Large common lawns are typical for larger homes within historic neighborhoods. A front porch is optional, but if it is used, it can be one or two stories.  
Porch: The main facade of the building has a small setback from the frontage 
line. The resulting front yard is typically very small and can be defined by 
a fence or a hedge. the porch can encroach into the setback to the point that the porch extends to the build-to-line. The porch can be one or two stories. A minimum depth of six (6) foot clear is required within the development standards to ensure usability. On downslope lots the setback is typically minimized to improve the development feasibility of the lot. On upslope lots it is maximized to reduce visual impact of the building on the streetscape. 
Forecourt: The main facade of the building is at or near the build-to-line and a small percentage of it is set back, creating a small court space. The space could be used as an entry court or shared garden space for apartment buildings, or as an additional shopping or restaurant seating area within commercial zones. The proportions and orientation of these spaces should be carefully considered for solar orientation and user comfort. This frontage type should be used sparingly and should not be repeated within a block. A short wall, hedge, or fence shall be 
placed along the undefined edge. 
Stoop: The main facade of the building is near the build-to-line and the elevated stoop engages the sidewalk. The stoop should be elevated a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches above the sidewalk to ensure privacy within the building. The stairs from the stoop may lead directly to the sidewalk or may be side loaded. 
The minimum width and depth of the stoop should be five (5) feet. This type is 
appropriate for residential uses with small setbacks. 
Awning: The main facade of the building is at or near the build-to-line and the canopy or awning element may overlap the sidewalk. The canopy is structural, catilevered and shed roof. The awning is canvas or similar material and is often retractable. The coverings should extend far enough from the building to provide adequate protection for pedestrians. This type is appropriate for retail and commercial uses only because of the lack of a raised ground story. 
Gallery: The main facade of the building is at the build-to-line and the gallery element overlaps the sidewalk. The entry should be at the same grade as the sidewalk. This type can be one or two stories and is intended for retail uses. The gallery should extend close enough to the curb so that a pedestrian cannot bypass it. Due to the overlap of the right-of-way, an easement is usually required. A minimum depth is required within the development standards to ensure usability. This type is appropriate for ground commercial uses.

based upon the grounds identical to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution required by this Section. Upon the enactment of a curative amendment to, or the reaffirmation of the validity of this Ordinance, 
no rights to a cure by amendment or challenge shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the unamended Zoning Ordinance for which the Millersburg 
Borough Council propose to prepare a curative amendment; and, 
4. 	The Millersburg Borough Council, having utilized the procedures as set forth in this Section, may not again utilize said procedures for a thirty-six (36) month period following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment, or 
reaffirmation of the validity of the Ordinance; provided however, that if after the date of declaration and proposal 
there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed upon Millersburg Borough by virtue of a decision by any Court of competent jurisdiction, the Millersburg Borough Council may utilize the provisions of this Section to 
prepare a curative amendment to the Ordinance to fulfill this duty or obligation. 
H. 	Authentication of Official Zoning Map. Whenever there has been a change in the boundary of a zone or a reclassification of the zone adopted in accordance with the above, the change on the Official Zoning Map shall be made, and shall be duly certified by the Millersburg Borough Secretary and shall thereafter be refiled as part of the permanent records of Millersburg Borough.

shall expire each year.  The Zoning Hearing Board shall promptly notify Millersburg Borough of any vacancies which occur.  
Appointments to fill vacancies shall hold no other office in Millersburg Borough.  Any member of the Zoning Hearing Board may be removed for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a majority vote of the Millersburg Borough Council taken after the member has received fifteen (15) days advance notice of the intent to take such 
a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in writing. 
B. 
C. 
D. 
The Millersburg Borough Council may appoint by resolution at least one (1) but no more than three (3) residents of the 
municipality to serve as alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board. The term of office of an alternate member shall 
be three (3) years. When seated pursuant to the provisions of this Section, an alternate shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings and discussions of the Zoning Hearing Board to the same and full extent as provided by law for Zoning Hearing 
Board members, including specifically the right to cast a vote as a voting member during the proceedings, and shall have all the powers and duties set forth in this Ordinance and as otherwise provided by law.  Alternates shall hold no other office in 
Millersburg Borough, including membership on the Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator.

Organization of Zoning Hearing Board 
The Zoning Hearing Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall serve annual terms as such and 
may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum shall be not less than a 
majority of all members of the Zoning Hearing Board, but the Zoning Hearing Board may appoint a hearing officer from 
its own membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf and the parties may waive further action by the Zoning Hearing 
Board as provided in Section 4:1:17.E. If, by reason of absence or disqualification of a member, a quorum is not reached, 
the Chairman of the Zoning Hearing Board shall designate as many alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board to sit on the Zoning Hearing Board as may be needed to provide a quorum. Any alternate member of the Zoning Hearing Board shall continue to serve on the Zoning Hearing Board in all proceedings involving the matter or case for which the alternate 
was initially appointed until the Zoning Hearing Board has made a final determination of the matter or case. Designation 
of an alternate pursuant to this section shall be made on a case-by-case basis in rotation according to declining seniority among all alternates. The Zoning Hearing Board may make, alter, and rescind rules and forms for its procedure, consistent with Ordinances of Millersburg Borough and laws of the Commonwealth.  The Zoning Hearing Board shall keep full public records of its business, which records shall be the property of Millersburg Borough, and shall submit a report of its activities to the Millersburg Borough Council upon request. 
Expenditures for Services 
Within the limits of funds appropriated by the Millersburg Borough Council, the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical and clerical services. Members of the Zoning 
Hearing Board may receive compensation for the performance of their duties, as may be fixed by the Millersburg Borough Council. Alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board may receive compensation, as may be fixed by the Millersburg 
Borough Council, for the performance of their duties when designated as alternate members pursuant to Section 4:1:17(A), but in no case shall such compensation exceed the rate of compensation authorized to be paid to the members by the Millersburg Borough Council.

2. 	The hearings shall be conducted by the Zoning Hearing Board or the Zoning Hearing Board may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer.  The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be made by the Zoning Hearing Board; however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to Millersburg Borough, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decisions or findings by the Zoning Hearing Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final; 
3. 	The parties to the hearing shall be Millersburg Borough, any person affected by the application who has made timely appearance of record before the Zoning Hearing Board, and any other person including civic or community organizations permitted to appear by the Zoning Hearing Board.

The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, with any party or his representatives in connection with any issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their solicitor, unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the materials so noticed and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to be present; 
9.

Where the application is contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by the findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together with the reasons therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this or of any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final the Zoning Hearing Board shall make his report and recommendations available to the parties within forty-five 
(45) days and the parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Zoning Hearing Board 
prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Zoning Hearing Board’s decision shall be entered no later than thirty (30) days after the report of the hearing officer.  Except for challenges filed under Article IX of the PA MPC, 
where the Zoning Hearing Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this subsection or fails to commence, conduct or complete the required hearing as provided in Section 4:1:17.D of this Ordinance, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Zoning Hearing Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Zoning Hearing Board shall give public notice of said decision with ten (10) days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in Section 4:1:17.D of this Ordinance. If the Zoning Hearing Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing the application to appeal. 
10. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the findings shall be delivered to the applicant 
personally or mailed to him not later than the next business day following its date. To all other persons who have 
filed their name and address with the Zoning Hearing Board not later than the last day of the hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be examined; and, 
11. 	Effect of Zoning Hearing Board’s Decision 
a. 	If the variance or special exception is granted or the issuance of a permit is approved, or other action by the appellant is authorized, the necessary permit shall be secured and the authorized action begun within two 
(2) years after the date when the variance or special exception is finally granted, or the issuance of a permit is finally approved, or the other action by the appellant is authorized, and the building or alteration, as the 
case may be, shall be completed within three (3) years of said date. For good cause, the Zoning Hearing 
Board may at any time, upon application in writing extend either of these deadlines; 
b. 	Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within said two (2) year period, or having obtained the permit, should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two (2) year period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances and permits granted to him shall be deemed 
automatically rescinded by the Zoning Hearing Board; 
c. 	Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or alteration within said two (2) year period, but should he fail to complete such construction or alteration within said three (3) year period, the Zoning Hearing Board may, upon ten (10) days’ notice in writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance or special exception, or the issuance of the permit, or permits, or the other action authorized to the appellant or 
applicant, if the Zoning Hearing Board finds that no good cause appears for the failure to complete within such three (3) year period, and if the Zoning Hearing Board further finds that conditions have so altered or 
changed in the interval since the granting of the variance, permit or action, that revocation or rescission of 
the action is justified; and, 
d. 	As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as part of the original application before the Zoning Hearing Board, the granting of a timetable associated with the request which would supersede the deadlines imposed. In so doing, the applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are logically related to normal and expected progress of the project. In approving a timetable under this section, the 
Zoning Hearing Board must establish and bind a definite time frame for (1) issuance of a zoning permit, 
and (2) completion of construction of the project. 
E. 	Zoning Hearing Board’s Functions 
The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render decisions in the following matters: 
1. 	Substantive Challenges to the Validity of the Zoning Ordinance, except those brought before the Millersburg Borough Council pursuant to Section 916.1(a)(2) of the PA MPC. 
a. 	If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended amendments to the challenged Ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider: 
(1) 	The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies, schools and other public 
service facilities;

Ordinance or Zoning Map; 
(3) 	The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site’s soils, slopes, woodland, 
wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features; 
(4) 	The impact of the proposed use on the site’s soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands,  floodplains, 
natural resources and nature features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the

(5) 	The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other land uses which are 
essential to public health and welfare; 
b. 	
Public notice of the hearing shall be provided as specified in Section 4:1:17.D of this Ordinance. 

c. 	
The Zoning Hearing Board shall commence its hearings within sixty (60) days after the request is filed unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time; and, 

d. 	
The Zoning Hearing Board, shall render its decision within forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of 


the last hearing. If the Board fails to act on the landowner’s request within this time limit a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last hearing; 
2. 	Challenges to the Validity of the Zoning Ordinance, raising procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Ordinance; 
3. 	Special Exceptions as provided for in this Ordinance and subject to all applicable requirements, including, but not limited to:

Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use (e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water and other utilities, vehicular access, etc.); 

(5) 	
The proposed use complies with the Millersburg Borough Floodplain Ordinance; 

(6) 	
The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed in Chapter 2 of this

d. 	
Site Plan Approval.  Any site plan presented in support of the Special Exception pursuant to Section 


4:1:17.E.3 shall become an official part of the record for said Special Exception. Approval of any Special Exception will also bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore, should a change in 
the site plan be required as part of the approval of the use, the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the 
issuance of a zoning permit. Any subsequent change to the use on the subject property not reflected on the originally approved site plan, shall require the obtainment of another Special Exception Approval;

Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning Hearing Board may, by rule, prescribe the 
form of application to the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a Variance, provided that all 
of the following findings are made where relevant in a given case: 
a. 	That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Ordinance in the neighborhood or zone in which the 
property is located; 
b. 	That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is not a possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance and that the authorization of a Variance 
is therefore necessary to enable reasonable use of the property; 
c. 	
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant; 

d. 	
That the Variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the zone or neighborhood in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of 


adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; 
e. That the Variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will 
represent the least modification possible of the regulations in issue; 
f. 	
The proposed use complied with the Millersburg Borough Floodplain Ordinance; 

g. 	
In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Ordinance. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Administrator and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a 


violation of this Ordinance;

i. 	 Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board in approving Variance applications, may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are more restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zone. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Administrator and failure to comply with such conditions will constitute a 
violation of this Ordinance; and, 
j. 	 Site Plan Approval. Any site plan presented in support of a Variance shall become an official part of the 
record for said Variance.  Approval of any Variance will also bind the use in accordance with the submitted 
site plan; 
5. 	Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Administrator, including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the application therefore, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the registration 
or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or lot; 
6. 	
Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged with the administration of any transfers of development rights or performance density provisions of the Zoning Ordinance;

F. 	Parties Appellant before the Zoning Hearing Board

G. 	Time Limitations 
No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later than thirty (30) days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by the Zoning Administrator or the agency responsible 
for granting such approval if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice or knowledge, or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. 
The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision by the Zoning Administrator a challenge 
to the validity of this Ordinance or the Official Zoning Map pursuant to Section 916.2 of the PA Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially 
deviates from the approved tentative preliminary approval. 
H. 	Stay of Proceeding 
1. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section F above and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing 
Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged Ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Administrator 
or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning Administrator or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case, the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise 
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction 
of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Office or other appropriate agency or body.  When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by person other than the applicant, the applicant 
may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such person to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a 
hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits 
of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee but such waiver may 
be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court. The question whether or not such petition 
should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory.  An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory. 
2. 	If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellant court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner. 
I. 	Appeal 
Any person, taxpayer, or Millersburg Borough aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board may within thirty (30) days after such decision of the Zoning Hearing Board seek review by the Court of Common Pleas of such decision in the manner provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PA Municipalities Planning Code as amended.
