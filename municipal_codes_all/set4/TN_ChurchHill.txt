PREFACE
The Church Hill Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of
the ordinances of the City of Church Hill, Tennessee. By referring to the
historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine
the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
iii
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team, Emily Keyser, Linda Winstead,
Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown, is gratefully acknowledged.

(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the

initiate action to recover any undocumented travel advances.
(4) Travel advances are available only for special travel and only after
completion and approval of the travel authorization form.
(5) The travel expense reimbursement form will be used to document
all expense claims.

The CAO may make exceptions for unusual circumstances.
Expenses considered excessive won't be allowed.

reimbursement must be supported by the original paid receipt for lodging,
vehicle rental, phone calls, public carrier travel, conference fee, and other

funds is subject to legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/or
advances.

ordinarily considered eligible expenses for reimbursement. (2003 Code,

shall be reimbursed according to the federal travel regulation rates. The city's
travel reimbursement rates will automatically change when the federal rates
are adjusted.
The municipality may pay directly to the provider for expenses such as
meals, lodging, and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars, and
other education programs. (2003 Code, § 1-1304)

by reference--as if fully set out herein--the administrative procedures submitted

8-227. Violations. Except as provided in § 8-224, any violation of this
chapter shall constitute a civil offense and shall, upon conviction, be punishable

the revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within
that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed withdrawn.

reason of lack of maintenance and because of progressive deterioration, certain
properties have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating
slums and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid
13-9
conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditure of
large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate same, and that by reason
of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums
and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
uses and neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare
protected and fostered. (2003 Code, § 4-701)
13-402. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public
health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, condition and occupancy of residential and nonresidential
premises; to establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and
other physical components and conditions essential to make the aforesaid
facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and use; to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators, and occupants; to
authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violations of this chapter; and
to provide for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use. (2003 Code, § 4-702)
13-403. Administration fees. All owners or persons in possession,
charge or control, of any place or premises on which a nuisance is created,
accumulated or produced which must be abated by the city as a result of their
failure or refusal to comply with an order of the building inspector, are liable for
and shall pay an administration fee in addition to the cost of repair, alteration
or improvement, or, vacating and closing, or, removal or demolition by the
building inspector; which fee shall be set by resolution of the board of mayor and
aldermen. (2003 Code, § 4-703)
13-404. Care of premises. Having adopted by reference the Standard
Housing Code published by the Southern Building Code Congress, International,
Inc., it shall hereby be unlawful, in conformance with said code, for the owner
or occupant of a residential building, structure, or property to utilize the
premises of such residential property for the open storage of any abandoned
motor vehicle, ice box, refrigerator, stove, glass, building material, building
rubbish or similar items. It shall be the duty and responsibility of every such
owner or occupant to keep the premises of such residential property clean and
to remove from the premises all such abandoned items as listed above, including
but not limited to weeds, dead trees, trash, garbage, etc., upon notice from the
building inspector. (2003 Code, § 4-704)
13-405. Administration. All inspections, regulations, enforcement and
hearings on violations of the provisions of this chapter shall be under the
direction and supervision of the building inspector. The building inspector may
13-10
designate such other employees to perform duties as may be necessary to the
enforcement of this chapter, including the making of inspections and holding of
hearings. (2003 Code, § 4-705)
13-406. Applicability. Every residential, nonresidential or mixed
occupancy building and the land on which it is situated, used or intended to be
used for dwelling, commercial, business or industrial occupancy or use shall
comply with the provisions of this chapter, whether or not such building shall
have been constructed, altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this
chapter, and irrespective of any permits or licenses which shall have been issued
for the use or occupancy of the building or premises for the construction or
repair of the building, or for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities
prior to the effective date of this chapter. This chapter shall also apply to mobile
home parks. (2003 Code, § 4-706)
13-407. Controlling standards. In any case where the provisions of
this chapter impose a higher standard than set forth in any other ordinance or
under the laws of the state, then the standards set forth herein shall prevail, but
if the provisions of this chapter impose a lower standard than any other local
ordinance or of the laws of the state, then the higher standard shall prevail.
(2003 Code, § 4-707)
13-408. Compliance with other ordinances. No provision herein
shall relieve any owner, operator or occupant from complying with any other
provision, nor relieve any inspector of the city from enforcing any other provision
of the code of ordinances. (2003 Code, § 4-708)
13-409. Dwellings unfit for human habitation. Pursuant to
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 13-21-101, et seq., it is hereby found that there
exist in the City of Church Hill, structures which are unfit for human occupation
or use due to dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accident or
other calamities, lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or due to other
conditions rendering such structures unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or
detrimental to the health, safety or morals, or otherwise inimical to the welfare
of the residents of the city. (2003 Code, § 4-709)

exercise the powers herein prescribed. (2003 Code, § 4-711)
13-412. Institution of action and notification. Whenever a petition
is filed with the building inspector by a public authority or by at least five (5)
residents of the City of Church Hill charging that any structure is unfit for
human occupation or use, or whenever it appears to the building inspector on
his own motion that any structure is unfit for occupation or use, the building
inspector shall, if, after making a preliminary investigation, such investigation
discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner
of and parties in interest of such structure, a complaint stating the charges in
that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the
building inspector (or his designated agent) at a time and place therein fixed not

13-413. Determination of and further notice by building
inspector. If, after such notice and hearing as above prescribed, the building
inspector determines that the structure under consideration is unfit for human
13-12
habitation or use, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such
determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof
an order:
(1) If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said structure can
be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure requiring
the owner within the time specified in the order to repair, alter, or improve such
structure to render it fit for human occupation or use or if not adequately
repaired, altered or improved within the time specified in the order to vacate
and close the dwelling as a place of human habitation or use; or
(2) If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said structure
cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure
requiring the owner within the time specified in the order to remove or demolish
such structure.
(3) The building inspector shall determine the value of the structure
in question existing on the land and the value of the land itself shall not be
considered, and if the structure can be made to conform to such standards as
will make it properly habitable by an expenditure of not more than fifty percent
(50%) of said value, the order referred to in the preceding paragraph shall
conform to the first alternative. If an expenditure of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the value just referred to would be necessary to make the structure
properly habitable, the order in the preceding paragraph shall conform to the
second alternative.
(4) Any repair, alteration or improvement instituted in compliance
with this chapter shall be made in conformance with the then existing zoning
and building codes. (2003 Code, § 4-713)
13-414. Failure of owner to comply to vacate and repair. If the
owner fails to comply with the order under § 13-413(1), the building inspector
may cause such structure to be repaired, altered or improved or be vacated and
closed; and in such event the building inspector may cause to be posted on the
main entrance of any structure so closed a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human occupation; the use or occupation of this
building for human occupation or use is prohibited and unlawful." (2003 Code,
§ 4-714)
13-415. Failure of owner to remove or demolish. If the owner fails
to comply with an order as set forth in § 13-413(2), the building inspector may
cause such structure to be removed or demolished. (2003 Code, § 4-715)
13-416. Creation of lien and payment into court. The amount of the
cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or
removal or demolition by the building inspector shall, upon the filing of the
notice with the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the property
lies, be a lien in favor of the city against the real property on which such cost
13-13
was incurred, second only to liens of the state, county and city for taxes, any lien
of the city for special assessments, and any valid lien, right or interest in such
property duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such
notice. These costs shall be collected by the city tax collector at the same time
and in the same manner as property taxes are collected. If the structure is
removed or demolished by the building inspector, he shall sell the materials of
such structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the
removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the
chancery court by the building inspector, shall be secured in such manner as
may be directed by such court and shall be disbursed by such court to the person
found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court; provided
however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any
way the power of the City of Church Hill to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. (2003
Code, § 4-716)
13-417. Conditions rendering dwelling unfit for human
habitation. In addition to other standards set forth in this chapter, the
building inspector may determine that a structure is unfit for human occupation
or use if he finds that conditions exist in such structure which are dangerous or
injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of such structure, the
occupants of neighboring structures or other residents of the city; such
conditions may include the following but without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: Defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other
calamities; lack of adequate ventilation, light or sanitary facilities; dilapidation;
disrepair; structural defects; and uncleanliness. (2003 Code, § 4-717)
13-418. Service of complaints or orders. Complaints or orders issued
by the building inspector pursuant to this chapter shall be served upon persons
either personally or by registered mail, but if the whereabouts of such persons
is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the building inspector in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, and the building inspector shall make affidavit
to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons
may be made by publishing the same once each week for two (2) consecutive
weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the city. A copy of such
complaint or order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected by the complaint or order. A copy of such complaint or order shall also
be filed for record in the register's office of the county in which the structure is
located and such filing of the complaint or order shall have the same force and
effects as other lis pendens notices provided by law. (2003 Code, § 4-718)
13-419. Enjoining enforcement of order. (1) Any person affected by
an order issued by the building inspector may file a bill in the chancery court for
an injunction restraining the building inspector from carrying out the provisions
13-14
of the order, and the court may, upon the filing of such bill, issue a temporary
injunction restraining the building inspector pending the final disposition of the
cause; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the posting and
service of the order of the building inspector, such persons shall file such bill in
the court. Hearings shall be had by the court on such bills within twenty (20)
days or as soon thereafter as possible, and shall be given preference over other
matters on the court's calendar.
(2) The court shall hear and determine the issue raised and shall enter
such final order or decree as law and justice may require. In all such
proceedings, the findings of the building inspector as to facts, if supported by
evidence, shall be conclusive. Costs shall be in the discretion of the court. The
remedies herein provided shall be exclusive remedies and no person affected by
an order of the building inspector shall be entitled to recover any damages for
action taken pursuant to any order of the building inspector, or because of
noncompliance by such person with any order of the building inspector. (2003
Code, § 4-719)
13-420. Powers given the building inspector. The building inspector
is authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry
out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter including the
following powers in addition to others herein granted:
(1) To investigate conditions in the city in order to determine which
structures therein are unfit for human occupation or use.
(2) To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and
receive evidence.
(3) To enter upon premises for the purposes of making examinations
provided that such entries shall be made in such manner as to cause the least
possible inconvenience to the persons in possession. (2003 Code, § 4-720)
13-421. Building inspector designated to act. The building inspector
is hereby designated as the public officer of the City of Church Hill who shall
exercise the powers set out in this chapter. (2003 Code, § 4-721)
13-422. Institution of action and notification. Pursuant to
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 6-54-113, if it is determined by the building
inspector that any owner of record of real property has created, maintained, or
permitted to be maintained on such property the growth of trees, vines, grass,
underbrush and/or the accumulation of debris, trash, litter, or garbage or any
combination of the preceding elements so as to endanger the health, safety, or
welfare of other citizens or to encourage the infestation of rats and other
harmful animals, the building inspector shall provide notice to the owner of
record to remedy the condition immediately. The notice shall be given by United
States mail, addressed to the last known address of the owner of record. The
notice shall state that the owner of the property is entitled to a hearing. The
13-15
notice shall be written in plain language and shall also include but not be
limited to the following elements:
(1) A brief statement of this chapter which shall contain the
consequences of failing to remedy the noted condition;
(2) The person, office, address and telephone number of the
department or person giving notice;
(3) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition which shall be
in conformity with the standards of cost in the city; and
(4) A place wherein the notified party may return a copy of the notice,
indicating the desire for a hearing. (2003 Code, § 4-722)
13-423. Failure of owner to comply. If the person fails or refuses to
remedy the condition within ten (10) days after receiving the notice, the building
inspector shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at
a cost in conformity with reasonable standards and the cost thereof assessed
against the owner of the property. Upon filing of the notice with the office of the
register of deeds of the county in which the property lies, the costs shall be a lien
upon the property in favor of the city, second only to liens of the state, county
and municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality for special assessments,
and any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded or duly
perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These costs shall be
collected by the city tax collector at the same time and in the same manner as
city property taxes are collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs, they may
be collected at the same time and in the same manner as delinquent property
taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as
delinquent property taxes.
Provided, however, if the person who is the owner of record is a carrier
engaged in the transportation of property or is a utility transmitting
communications, electricity, gas, liquids, steam, sewerage, or other materials,
the ten (10) day period of the first sentence of this section shall be twenty (20)
days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. (2003 Code, § 4-723)
13-424. Rules; hearings; and stay of enforcement. (1) The board of
mayor and aldermen may make rules and regulations necessary for the
administration and enforcement of this chapter. The building inspector shall
provide for a hearing upon request of the person aggrieved by the determination
made pursuant to § 13-422. A request for a hearing shall be made within ten
(10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to § 13-422. Failure
to make the request within this time shall without exception constitute a waiver
of the right to a hearing.
(2) Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the building inspector
under provisions of this chapter may seek judicial review of the order or act.
The time period established in § 13-423 shall be stayed during the pendency of
a hearing. (2003 Code, § 4-724)
13-16
13-425. Fines. That any person violating any provision of this chapter
shall be guilty of an offense and upon conviction shall pay a penalty of not less
than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each offense.
Each occurrence shall constitute a separate offense. (2003 Code, § 4-726)

members shall be of three (3) years except that in the appointment of the first
municipal planning commission, under the terms of this chapter, three (3) of
said members shall be appointed for a term of three (3) years, three for a term

14-201. Bond required for specially called meeting. Any owners of
property within the municipal limits, or within the planning region of the
Church Hill Regional Planning Commission, who request a special call meeting
of the planning commission for the preliminary and/or final approval of any
subdivision plans shall, at the time that the owner requests such specially called
meeting, deposit with the recorder's office a cash bond in the sum of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) to defray all expenses associated with the calling and
holding of such special meeting. (2003 Code, § 11-201)
14-202. Criteria for special meeting at owner's request. After the
owner who requests the specially called meeting has posted the necessary cash
bond, the planning commission shall determine, by a majority vote, whether it
is necessary and proper that a special meeting is to be held in order to
accommodate the landowner who requests approval of subdivision plans.
Specially called meetings of the Church Hill Regional Planning Commission
shall be held only at the discretion of the planning commission itself and only
under such circumstances as would prevent extreme hardship on the applicant
property owner. In exercising its discretion, the planning commission should
also take into consideration the reason or reasons given for the landowner's
failure to appear with the necessary plats and plans to request approval at the
commission's regular monthly meeting. If the planning commission determines
by a majority of the vote that a specially called meeting is necessary and proper
to avoid undue hardship upon the applicant property owner then the specially
called meeting shall be set on a date convenient with a majority of the planning
commission members. Specially called meetings of the Church Hill Regional
Planning Commission shall consider only the business which was the basis of
the special request. (2003 Code, § 11-202)

Church Hill, Tennessee." (2003 Code, § 11-301, as replaced by Ord. #15-471,
March 2015)
14-302. General provisions. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this
chapter to:
(a) Protect, maintain, and enhance the environment of the city
and the public health, safety and the general welfare of the citizens of the
city, by controlling discharges of pollutants to the city's stormwater
system and to maintain and improve the quality of the receiving waters
into which the stormwater outfails flow, including, without limitation,
lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, wetlands, and groundwater of the city;
(b) Enable the city to comply with the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System permit (NPDES) and applicable
regulations, 40 CFR 122.26 for stormwater discharges;
(c) Allow the city to exercise the powers granted in Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 68-221-1105, which provides that, among other powers
cities have with respect to stormwater facilities, is the power by
ordinance or resolution to:
(i) Exercise general regulation over the planning,
location, construction, and operation and maintenance of
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-4
stormwater facilities in the city, whether or not owned and
operated by the city;
(ii) Adopt any rules and regulations deemed necessary to
accomplish the purposes of this statute, including the adoption of
a system of fees for services and permits;
(iii) Establish standards to regulate the quantity of
stormwater discharged and to regulate stormwater contaminants
as may be necessary to protect water quality;
(iv) Review and approve plans and plats for stormwater
management in proposed subdivisions or commercial
developments;
(v) Issue permits for stormwater discharges, or for the
construction, alteration, extension, or repair of stormwater
facilities;
(vi) Suspend or revoke permits when it is determined that
the permittee has violated any applicable ordinance, resolution, or
condition of the permit;
(vii) Regulate and prohibit discharges into stormwater
facilities of sanitary, industrial, or commercial sewage or waters
that have otherwise been contaminated; and
(viii) Expend funds to remediate or mitigate the
detrimental effects of contaminated land or other sources of
stormwater contamination, whether public or private.
(2) Administering entity. The city's stormwater manager shall
administer the provisions of this chapter.
(3) Stormwater management ordinance. The intended purpose of this
ordinance is to safeguard property and public welfare by regulating stormwater
drainage and requiring temporary and permanent provisions for its control. It
should be used as a planning and engineering implement to facilitate the
necessary control of stormwater. (2003 Code, § 11-302, as replaced by Ord.
#15-471, March 2015)
14-303. Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply: words used in the singular shall include the plural, and
the plural shall include the singular; words used in the present tense shall
include the future tense. The word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary.
The word "may" is permissive. Words not defined in this section shall be
construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in
the latest edition of Webster' s Dictionary.
(1) "Administrative or civil penalties." Under the authority provided
in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-221-1106, the city declares that any person
violating the provisions of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the
city of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five thousand
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-5
dollars ($5,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
(2) "As built plans" means drawings depicting conditions as they were
actually constructed.
(3) "Best Management Practices (BMPs)" means schedules of
activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other
management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge or pollutants to waters
of the state. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures,
and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste
disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.
(4) "Borrow pit" is an excavation from which erodible material
(typically soil) is removed to be fill for another site. There is no processing or
separation of erodible material conducted at the site. Given the nature of
activity and pollutants present at such excavation, a borrow pit is considered a
construction activity for the purpose of this permit.
(5) "Buffer zone" means a setback from the top of water body's bank
of undisturbed vegetation, including trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation;
enhanced or restored vegetation; or the re-establishment of native vegetation
bordering streams, ponds, wetlands, springs, reservoirs or lakes, which exists
or is established to protect those water bodies. The goal of the water quality
buffer is to preserve undisturbed vegetation that is native to the streamside
habitat in the area of the project. Vegetated, preferably native, water quality
buffers protect water bodies by providing structural integrity and canopy cover,
as well as stormwater infiltration, filtration and evapotranspiration. Buffer
width depends on the size of a drainage area. Streams or other waters with
drainage areas less than one (1) square mile will require buffer widths of thirty
feet (30') minimum. Streams or other waters with drainage areas greater than
one (1) square mile will require buffer widths of sixty feet (60') minimum. The
sixty feet (60') criterion for the width of the buffer zone can be established on an
average width basis at a project, as long as the minimum width of the buffer
zone is more than thirty feet (30') at any measured location. The MS4 must
develop and apply criteria for determining the circumstances under which these
averages will be available. A determination that standards cannot be met may
not be based solely on the difficulty or cost associated with implementation.
Every attempt should be made for development and redevelopment activities not
to take place within the buffer zone. If water quality buffer widths as defined
above cannot be fully accomplished on-site, the MS4 must develop and apply
criteria for determining the circumstances under which alternative buffer
widths will be available. A determination that water quality buffer widths
cannot be met on site may not be based solely on the difficulty or cost of
implementing measures, but must include multiple criteria, such as: type of
project, existing land use and physical conditions that preclude use of these
practices.

(6) "Buffer zone requirements." (a) "Construction" applies to all
streams adjacent to construction sites, with an exception for streams
designated as impaired or exceptional Tennessee waters, as designated
by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. A thirty
foot (30') natural riparian buffer zone adjacent to all streams at the
construction site shall be preserved, to the maximum extent practicable,
during construction activities at the site. The water quality buffer zone
is required to protect waters of the state located within or immediately
adjacent to the boundaries of the project, as identified using methodology
from Standard Operating Procedures for Hydrologic Determinations (see
rules to implement a certification program for Qualified Hydrologic
Professionals, TN Rules Chapter 0400-40-17). Buffer zones are not
primary sediment control measures and should not be relied on as such.
Rehabilitation and enhancement of a natural buffer zone is allowed, if
necessary, for improvement of its effectiveness of protection of the waters
of the state. The buffer zone requirement only applies to new construction
sites. The riparian buffer zone should be preserved between the top of
stream bank and the disturbed construction area. The thirty feet (30')
criterion for the width of the buffer zone can be established on an average
width basis at a project, as long as the minimum width of buffer zone is
more than fifteen feet (15') at any measured location. Buffer zone
requirements for discharges into impaired or high quality waters. A sixty
foot (60') natural riparian buffer zone adjacent to the receiving stream
designated as impaired or high quality waters shall be preserved, to the
maximum extent practicable, during construction activities at the site.
The water quality buffer zone is required to protect waters of the state
(e.g., perennial and intermittent streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands) located
within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the project, as
identified on a 7.5-minute USGS quadrangle map, or as determined by
the director. Buffer zones are not sediment control measures and should
not be relied upon as primary sediment control measures. Rehabilitation
and enhancement of a natural buffer zone is allowed, if necessary, for
improvement of its effectiveness of protection of the waters of the state.
The buffer zone requirement only applies to new construction sites. The
riparian buffer zone should be established between the top of stream
bank and the disturbed construction area. The sixty feet (60') criterion for
the width of the buffer zone can be established on an average width basis
at a project, as long as the minimum width of the buffer zone is more
than twenty-five feet (25') at any measured location.
(b) "Permanent" new development and significant
redevelopment sites are required to preserve water quality buffers along
waters within the MS4. Buffers shall be clearly marked on site

Buffer width depends on the size of a drainage area. Streams or other
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-7
waters with drainage areas less than one (1) square mile will require
buffer widths of thirty feet (30') minimum. Streams or other waters with
drainage areas greater than one (1) square mile will require buffer widths
of sixty feet (60') minimum. The sixty feet (60') criterion for the width of
the buffer zone can be established on an average width basis at a project,
as long as the minimum width of the buffer zone is more than thirty feet
(30') at any measured location.

a specific plot. A common plan of development or sale identifies a situation in
which multiple areas of disturbance are occurring on contiguous areas. This
applies because the activities may take place at different times, on different
schedules, by different operators.
(9) "Design storm event" means a hypothetical storm event, of a given
frequency interval and duration, used in the analysis and design of a

completed (has a valid certification from) the "Fundamentals of Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control Level I" course or equivalent course. An
inspector performs and documents the required inspections, paying particular
attention to time-sensitive permit requirements such as stabilization and
maintenance activities. An inspector may also have the following
responsibilities:

(32) "Soils report" means a study of soils on a subject property with the
primary purpose of characterizing and describing the soils. The soils report shall
be prepared by a qualified soils engineer, who shall be directly involved in the
soil characterization either by performing the investigation or by directly
supervising employees conducting the investigation .
(33) "Stabilization" means providing adequate measures, vegetative
and/or structural, that will prevent erosion from occurring.
(34) "Stormwater" means stormwater runoff, snow melt runoff, surface
runoff, street wash waters related to street cleaning or maintenance, infiltration

Regulations of the State of Tennessee, chapter 1200-4-3-.04(3)). (2003 Code,
§ 11-304, as replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)
14-304. Waivers. (1) General. No waivers will be granted any
construction or site work project. All construction and site work shall provide for
stormwater management as required by this ordinance. However, alternatives
to the 2010 NPDES General Permit for Discharges from Small Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer Systems primary requirement for on-site permanent
stormwater management may be considered, if:
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-12
(a) Management measures cannot be designed, built and
maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire, harvest and/or use, at a
minimum, the first inch of every rainfall event preceded by seventy-two
(72) hours of no measurable precipitation. This first inch of rainfall must
be one hundred percent (100%) managed with no discharge to surface
waters.
(b) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter. Alternative
minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges
have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been
approved by the city.

structures;
(b) Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
(c) Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
(d) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life or
property.
(3) Grading permit not to be issued where alternatives requested. No
grading permit shall be issued where an alternative has been requested until

maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. These include
city approved BMPs for permanent stormwater management including
green infrastructure BMPs.
(c) The city manual(s) may be updated and expanded from time
to time, at the discretion of the governing body of the city, upon the
recommendation of the stormwater manager, based on improvements in
engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience, or
changes in federal or state law or regulation. Stormwater facilities that
are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP
criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality
performance standards.
(2) Land development. This section shall be applicable to all land
development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision
applications, land disturbance applications and grading applications. These
standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one
(1) or more of the following criteria:
(a) One (1) acre or more;
(i) New development that involves land development
activities of one (1) acre or more;
(ii) Redevelopment that involves other land development
activity of one (1) acre or more;
(b) Projects or developments of less than one (1) acre of total
land disturbance may also be required to obtain authorization under this
ordinance if:
(i) The stormwater manager has determined that the
stormwater discharge from a site is causing, contributing to, or is
likely to contribute to a violation of a state water quality standard;
(ii) The stormwater manager has determined that the
stormwater discharge is, or is likely to be a significant contributor
of pollutants to waters of the state;
(iii) Changes in state or federal rules require sites of less
than one (1) acre that are not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale to obtain a stormwater permit;
(iv) Any new development or redevelopment, regardless
of size, that is defined by the stormwater manager to be a hotspot
land use; or
(v) Minimum applicability criteria set forth in item (a)
above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of
development, even multiple, that is part of a separate and distinct
land development activity that may take place at different times
on different schedules.
Note: Any discharge of stormwater or other fluid to an improved sinkhole or
other injection well, as defined, must be authorized by permit or rule as a

If requested, these permits must be provided before the issuance of any
land disturbance permit or the equivalent.
(4) Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for construction
stormwater management. The applicant must prepare a stormwater pollution
prevention plan for all construction activities that complies with subsection (7)
below. The purpose of this plan is to identify construction/contractor activities
that could cause pollutants in the stormwater, and to describe measures or
practices to control these pollutants during project construction.
(5) Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements. The erosion
prevention and sediment control plan component of the SWPPP shall accurately
describe the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation problems resulting
from land disturbing activity and shall explain and illustrate the measures that
are to be taken to control these problems. The length and complexity of the plan
is to be commensurate with the size of the project, severity of the site condition,
and potential for off-site damage. If necessary, the plan shall be phased so that
changes to the site during construction that alter drainage patterns or
characteristics will be addressed by an appropriate phase of the plan. The plan
shall be sealed by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect
licensed in the State of Tennessee. The plan shall also conform to the

trees to be removed and proposed planted trees. Tree protection measures
must be identified, and the diameter of the area involved must also be
identified on the plan and shown to scale. Information shall be supplied
concerning the proposed destruction of exceptional and historic trees in
setbacks and buffer strips, where they exist. Complete landscape plans
may be submitted separately. The plan must include the sequence of
implementation for tree protection measures.

include projected effects on property adjoining the site and on existing
drainage facilities and systems. The plan must address the adequacy of
outfalls from the development: when water is concentrated, what is the
capacity of waterways, if any, accepting stormwater off-site; and what
measures, including infiltration, sheeting into buffers, etc., are going to
be used to prevent the scouring of waterways and drainage areas off-site,
etc.

sediment, and debris on streets and public ways at a level acceptable to
the city. Soil, sediment, and debris brought onto streets and public ways
must be removed by the end of the work day to the satisfaction of the city.
Failure to remove the sediment, soil or debris shall be deemed a violation
of this ordinance.
(p) Proposed structures: location and identification of any
proposed additional buildings, structures or development on the site.
(q) A description of on-site measures to be taken to recharge
surface water into the ground water system through runoff reduction

Construction site operators shall control waste such as discarded building
materials, concrete truck washout, petroleum products and petroleum
related products, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction
site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality. When the material
is erodible, such as soil, the site must be treated as a construction site.
(6) General design performance criteria for permanent stormwater
management. The following performance criteria shall be addressed for
permanent stormwater management at all development sites:
(a) Site design standards for all new and redevelopment
require, in combination or alone, management measures that are
designed, built and maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire, harvest
and/or use, at a minimum, the first inch of every rainfall event preceded
by seventy-two (72) hours of no measurable precipitation. This first inch
of rainfall must be one hundred percent (100%) managed with no
discharge to surface waters.
(b) Limitations to the application of runoff reduction
requirements include, but are not limited to:
(i) Where a potential for introducing pollutants into the
groundwater exists, unless pretreatment is provided;
(ii) Where pre-existing soil contamination is present in
areas subject to contact with infiltrated runoff;
(iii) Presence of sinkholes or other karst features.
(c) Pre-development infiltrative capacity of soils at the site must
be taken into account in selection of runoff reduction management
measures.
(d) Incentive standards for re-developed sites: a ten percent
(10%) reduction in the volume of rainfall to be managed for any of the
following types of development. Such credits are additive such that a
maximum reduction of fifty percent (50%) of the standard in the
paragraph above is possible for a project that meets all five (5) criteria:
(i) Redevelopment;
(ii) Brownfield redevelopment;
(iii) High density (>7 units per acre);
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-17
(iv) Vertical density, (Floor to Area Ratio (FAR) of two (2)
or >18 units per acre); and
(v) Mixed use and transit oriented development (within
Y2 mile of transit).
(e) For projects that cannot meet one hundred percent (100%)
of the runoff reduction requirement unless subject to the incentive
standards, the remainder of the stipulated amount of rainfall must be
treated prior to discharge with a technology documented to remove eighty
percent (80%) Total Suspended Solids (TSS) unless an alternative
provided under this ordinance is approved. The treatment technology
must be designed, installed and maintained to continue to meet this
performance standard.
(f) For projects that cannot meet one hundred percent (100%)
of the runoff reduction requirements, the stormwater manager may allow
runoff reduction measures to be implemented at another location within
the same USGS twelve (12) digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) as the
original project. Off-site mitigation must be a minimum of 1.5 times the
amount of water not managed on site. The off-site mitigation location (or
alternative location outside the twelve (12) digit HUC) and runoff
reduction measures must be approved by the stormwater manager. The
stormwater manager shall identify priority areas within the watershed
in which mitigation projects can be completed. The stormwater manager
must create an inventory of appropriate mitigation projects, and develop
appropriate institutional standards and management systems to value,
evaluate and track transactions. Mitigation can be used for retrofit or
redevelopment projects, but should be avoided in areas of new
development.
(g) To protect stream channels from degradation, specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the MS4
BMP manual.
(h) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive
resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches,
recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional
performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices.
(i) Stormwater discharges from hot spots may require the
application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention
practices. In addition, stormwater from a hot spot land use may not be
infiltrated.
(j) Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land
disturbance permits shall consult with the stormwater manager to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-18
(k) The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
MS4 BMP manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.
(7) Minimum volume control requirements. (Note: the volume control
requirements are by the MS4 and not the TDEC MS4 Permit) in accordance
with 14-501(1)(c)(iii) the MS4 may establish standards to regulate the quantity
of stormwater discharged, therefore:
(a) Stormwater designs shall meet the multi-stage storm
frequency storage requirements as identified in the MS4 BMP manual.
(b) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
stormwater manager may impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(8) Permanent stormwater management plan requirements. The
stormwater management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the
stormwater manager to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project
site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present
and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of
the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site.
To accomplish this goal the stormwater management plan shall include the
following:
(a) Topographic base map: Topographic base map of the site
which extends a minimum of one hundred feet (100') beyond the limits of
the proposed development and indicates:
(i) Existing surface water drainage including streams,
ponds, culverts, ditches, sink holes, wetlands; and the type, size,
elevation, etc., of nearest upstream and downstream drainage
structures;
(ii) Current land use including all existing structures,
locations of utilities, roads, and easements;
(iii) All other existing significant natural and artificial
features;
(iv) Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage
of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns;
locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing
and grading.
(b) Proposed structural and non-structural BMPs;

the design storms referenced in the MS4 BMP manual; and
(ix) Documentation of sources for all computation
methods and field test results.
(e) Soils information: If a stormwater management control
measure depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration
basins), then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be
based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports.
The number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be
determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and
distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure.
(9) Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of all
permanent stormwater management facilities shall include detailed
maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued performance.
These plans will identify the parts or components of a stormwater management
facility that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training
necessary. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness
of the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional
maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. (2003 Code, § 11-305, as
replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)

maintenance, and inspection. (1) As built plans. All applicants are required
to submit actual as built plans for any structures located on-site after final
construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for
all stormwater management facilities and must be scaled by a registered
professional engineer licensed to practice in Tennessee. A final inspection by the
city is required before any performance security or performance bond will be
released. The city shall have the discretion to adopt provisions for a partial
pro-rata release of the performance security or performance bond on the
completion of various stages of development. In addition, occupation permits
shall not be granted until corrections to all BMPs have been made and accepted
by the city.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-20
(2) Landscaping and stabilization requirements. (a) Any area of land
from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or
wholly cleared by development activities shall stabilize. Stabilization
measures shall be initiated as soon as possible in portions of the site
where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased.
Temporary or permanent soil stabilization at the construction site (or a
phase of the project) must be completed not later than fifteen (15) days
after the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily
or permanently ceased. In the following situations, temporary
stabilization measures are not required:
(i) Where the initiation of stabilization measures is
precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions or adverse
soggy ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated
as soon as practicable; or
(ii) Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumed
within fifteen (15) days.
(b) Permanent stabilization with perennial vegetation (using
native herbaceous and woody plants where practicable) or other
permanently stable, non-eroding surface shall replace any temporary
measures as soon as practicable. Unpacked gravel containing fines (silt
and clay sized particles) or crusher runs will not be considered a
non-eroding surface.
(c) The following criteria shall apply to re-vegetation efforts:

vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or
its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the
plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion.
(iii) Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a
minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the cover crop
throughout the year immediately following re-vegetation. Revegetation
must be repeated in successive years until the
minimum seventy-five percent (75%) survival for one (1) year is
achieved.
(iv) In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping
plan must be submitted with the final design describing the
vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at
a site after construction is completed. This plan will explain not
only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-21
be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and
what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative
cover is preserved.
(3) Inspection of stormwater management facilities. Periodic
inspections of facilities shall be performed, documented, and reported in
accordance with this chapter.
(4) Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation of the stormwater facility, and of

least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the city during
inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
(5) Failure to meet or maintain design or maintenance standards. If
a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the design or maintenance standards
required for stormwater facilities under this chapter, the city, after reasonable
notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by
performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition.
In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to
public safety or public health, the city shall notify in writing the party
responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility. Upon
receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have thirty (30) days to effect
maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. In the event that
corrective action is not undertaken within that time, the city may take
necessary corrective action. The cost of any action by the city under this section
shall be charged to the responsible party, and shall include an
administrative/overhead charge of no less than two hundred dollars ($200.00),
nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each incident. (2003 Code,
§ 11-306, as replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)
14-307. Existing locations and ongoing developments. (1) On-site
stormwater management facilities maintenance agreement:
(a) Where the stormwater facility is located on property that is
subject to a development agreement, and the development agreement
provides for a permanent stormwater maintenance agreement that runs
with the land, the owners of property must execute an inspection and
maintenance agreement that shall operate as a deed restriction binding

maintenance shall be a lien against the property.
(2) Existing problem locations - no maintenance agreement. (a) The
stormwater manager shall in writing notify the owners of existing
locations and developments of specific drainage, erosion or sediment
problems affecting or caused by such locations and developments, and the
specific actions required to correct those problems. The notice shall also
specify a reasonable time for compliance. Discharges from existing BMPs
that have not been maintained and/or inspected in accordance with this
ordinance shall be regarded as illicit.
(b) Inspection of existing facilities. The city may, to the extent
authorized by state and federal law, enter and inspect private property
for the purpose of determining if there are illicit non-stormwater
discharges, and to establish inspection programs to verify that all
stormwater management facilities are functioning within design limits.
These inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-23
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations;
inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical
sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual
discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type
which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of the
city's NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other
agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records;
sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water

14-308. Illicit discharges. (1) Scope. This section shall apply to all
water generated on developed or undeveloped land entering the city's separate
storm sewer system.
(2) Prohibition of illicit discharges. No person shall introduce or cause
to be introduced into the municipal separate storm sewer system any discharge
that is not composed entirely of stormwater or any discharge that flows from
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-25
stormwater facility that is not inspected in accordance with § 14-506 which shall
be an illicit discharge. Non-stormwater discharges shall include, but shall not
be limited to, sanitary wastewater, car wash wastewater, radiator flushing
disposal, spills from roadway accidents, carpet cleaning wastewater, effluent
from septic tanks, improper oil disposal, laundry wastewater/gray water,
improper disposal of auto and household toxics. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any non-stormwater discharge to the municipal separate storm
sewer system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(a) Uncontaminated discharges from the following sources:
(i) Water line flushing or other potable water sources;
(ii) Landscape irrigation or lawn watering with potable
water;

(3) Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the municipal
separate storm sewer system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes,
without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether
the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of connection.
(4) Reduction of stormwater pollutants by the use of best management
practices. Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person's expense, the BMPs necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall
be deemed in compliance with the provisions ofthis section. Discharges from
existing BMPs that have not been maintained and/or inspected in accordance
with this ordinance shall be regarded as illicit.
(5) Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law,
as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in, illicit
discharges or pollutants discharging into, the municipal separate storm sewer
system, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials the person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the city in person or
by telephone, fax, or email, no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the city within three (3) business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years.
(6) No illegal dumping allowed. No person shall dump or otherwise
deposit outside an authorized landfill, convenience center or other authorized
garbage or trash collection point, any trash or garbage of any kind or description
on any private or public property, occupied or unoccupied, inside the city. (2003
Code, § 11-308, as replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)

14-309. Enforcement. (1) Enforcement authority. The stormwater
manager shall have the authority to issue notices of violation and citations, and
to impose the civil penalties provided in this section. Measures authorized
include:
(a) Verbal warnings. At a minimum, verbal warnings must
specify the nature of the violation and required corrective action.
(b) Written notices. Written notices must stipulate the nature
of the violation and the required corrective action, with deadlines for
taking such action.
(c) Citations with administrative penalties. The MS4 has the
authority to assess monetary penalties, which may include civil and
administrative penalties.
(d) Stop work orders. Stop work orders that require
construction activities to be halted, except for those activities directed at
cleru:i.ing up, abating discharge, and installing appropriate control
measures.
(e) Withholding of plan approvals or other authorizations.
Where a facility is in noncompliance, the MS4's own approval process
affecting the facility's ability to discharge to the MS4 can be used to abate
the violation.
(f) Additional measures. The MS4 may also use other escalated
measures provided under local legal authorities. The MS4 may perform
work necessary to improve erosion control measures and collect the funds
from the responsible party in an appropriate manner, such as collecting
against the project' s bond or directly billing the responsible party to pay
for work and materials.
(2) Notification of violation. (a) Verbal warning. Verbal warning may
be given at the discretion of the inspector when it appears the condition
can be corrected by the violator within a reasonable time, which time
shall be approved by the inspector.
(b) Written notice. Whenever the stormwater manager finds
that any permittee or any other person discharging stormwater has
violated or is violating this ordinance or a permit or order issued
hereunder, the stormwater manager may serve upon such person written
notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the
stormwater manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt
of the notice of violation.
(c) Consent orders. The stormwater manager is empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible
for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-28
by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as administrative orders issued pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below.
(d) Show cause hearing. The stormwater manager may order
any person who violates this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder,
to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action,
and a request that the violator show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
(e) Compliance order. When the stormwater manager finds
that any person has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a
permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the violator
directing that, following a specific time period, adequate structures or
devices be installed and/or procedures implemented and properly
operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance,
including the construction of appropriate structures, installation of
devices, self-monitoring, and management practices.
(f) Cease and desist and stop work orders. When the
stormwater manager finds that any person has violated or continues to
violate this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the
stormwater manager may issue a stop work order or an order to cease
and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance
to:
(i) Comply forthwith; or
(ii) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action
as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation; including halting operations except for terminating the
discharge and installing appropriate control measures.
(g) Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The
stormwater manager may suspend, revoke or modify the permit
authorizing the land development project or any other project of the
applicant or other responsible person within the city. A suspended,
revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other
responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the
notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein,
provided such permit may be reinstated upon such conditions as the
stormwater manager may deem necessary to enable the applicant or
other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure
such violations.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-29
(h) Conflicting standards. Whenever there is a conflict between
any standard contained in this chapter and in the BMP manual adopted
by the city under this ordinance, the strictest standard shall prevail.
(2003 Code, § 11-309, as replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)
14-310. Penalties. (1) Violations. Any person who shall commit any
act declared unlawful under this chapter, who violates any provision of this
chapter, who violates the provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this
chapter, or who fails or refuses to comply with any lawful communication or
notice to abate or take corrective action by the stormwater manager, shall be
guilty of a civil offense.
(2) Penalties. Under the authority provided in Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 68-221-1106, the city declares that any person violating the
provisions of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the stormwater
manager of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
(3) Measuring civil penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the
stormwater manager may consider:
(a) The harm done to the public health or the environment;
(b) Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial
economic deterrent to the illegal activity;
(c) The economic benefit gained by the violator;
(d) The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy this
violation;
(e) Any iinusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by
the city;
(f) The amount of penalty established by ordinance or
resolution for specific categories of violations; and
(g) Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of
imposing any penalty or damage assessment.
(4) Recovery of damages and costs. In addition to the civil penalty in
subsection (2) above, the city may recover:
(a) All damages proximately caused by the violator to the city,
which may include any reasonable expenses incurred in investigating
violations of, and enforcing compliance with, this chapter, or any other
actual damages caused by the violation.
(b) The costs of the city's maintenance of stormwater facilities
when the user of such facilities fails to maintain them as required by this
chapter.
(5) Referral to TDEC. Where the city has used progressive
enforcement to achieve compliance with this ordinance, and in the judgment of
the city has not been successful, the city may refer the violation to TDEC. For
the purposes of this provision, "progressive enforcement" shall mean two (2)
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-30
follow-up inspections and two (2) warning letters. In addition, enforcement
referrals to TDEC must include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) Construction project or industrial facility location;
(b) Name of owner or operator;
(c) Estimated construction project or size or type of industrial
activity (including SIC code, if known);
(d) Records of communications with the owner or operator
regarding the violation, including at least two follow-up inspections, two
(2) warning letters or notices of violation, and any response from the
owner or operator.
(6) Other remedies. The city may bring legal action to enjoin the
continuing violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at
law or equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.
(7) Remedies cumulative. The remedies set forth in this section shall
be cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil or
criminal, that one (1) or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought
or granted. (2003 Code, § 11-310, as replaced by Ord. #15-471, March 2015)
14-311. Appeals. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-1106(d), any person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil penalty or
damage assessment as provided by this chapter may appeal said penalty or
damage assessment to the city's governing body.
(1) Appeals to be in writing. The appeal shall be in writing and filed
with the municipal recorder or clerk within fifteen (15) days after the civil
penalty and/or damage assessment is served in any manner authorized by law.

City of Church Hill, Tennessee shall be considered to be in the R-1 Low Density
Residential District until otherwise classified.
(10) Private subdivision restrictions. No municipal regulation or
provision of this zoning ordinance is intended to abrogate or supersede any more
stringent conditions which may be contained in any valid deeds or contracts
pertaining to private subdivision developments or which may be set out in
private restrictive covenants regarding the use of property and the size and
location of buildings thereon within the municipal limits. The standards set out

for all land uses shall be required.
(7) Apartments and condominiums. An apartment project is defined
as any group of two (2) or more buildings to be constructed on one (1) parcel of
land. A condominium (condo) is one defined as a comprehensive residential or
commercial development where project design does not include standard street,
lot and subdivision arrangement, and where shares, property, or units are to be
sold. Apartments or condo projects may be allowed upon review and approval by
the Church Hill Planning Commission provided that the following are met:
(a) Basic requirements. (i) A site plan showing the location of
proposed buildings, roads, drives, parking utilities, drainage, and
any other information necessary for review must be presented to
the planning commission.
(ii) The planning commission should not approve a use
prohibited, or a smaller lot area per family than the minimum

asphalt or concrete. A compacted base course four (4) inches deep
shall be installed as specified in section 303 Standard
Specifications for Roads and Bridge Construction, Tennessee
Department of Highways latest version. A two (2) inch surface
course of asphalt as specified under Section 411, Asphaltic
Concrete Surface (hot mix) Grade E, mixed with sand Standards
Specifications for Road or Bridge Construction, Tennessee
Department of Highways latest version is required. A four (4) inch

stage will be given final approval once all improvements have been
made. A partial sale of some condo units or partial rental of some
apartment units may be allowed by the planning commission with
the reason documented in the minutes. Letters of credit or bonds
may be approved by the planning commission to cover the cost of
improvements not completed for condos or apartments by the
planning commission with the reason documented in the minutes.
(8) Communication facilities. (a) Communication towers for mobile
telephone services and other radio and television services which provide
for the needs of the citizens of the municipality will use the following
standards, to minimize adverse visual and operational effects of towers
through careful design, siting, and screening; to avoid potential damage
to adjacent properties from tower failure and falling ice, through
engineering and careful siting of towers; and to maximize use of any new
communication tower and/or existing structures to reduce the number of
towers needed.
(i) Application for a building permit for such
communication facility shall include:
(A) A report prepared by a professional engineer
licensed by the State of Tennessee describing the height and
design of the tower, which demonstrates the tower's
compliance with applicable structural standards, building
codes, electrical codes, and fire codes; and describes the
tower's capacity, including the number and type of antennas
it can accommodate. In case of an antenna mounted on an
existing structure, the report shall indicate the existing
structure's suitability to accept the antenna and the
proposed method of affixing the antenna to the structure.
Complete details of all fixtures, couplings and the precise
point of attachment shall be indicated.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-47
(B) An adequate report inventorying existing
towers and antenna sites within a reasonable distance from
the proposed site, outlining the opportunities for shared use
as an alternative to the proposed use. The applicant must
demonstrate that the proposed tower or antenna cannot be
accommodated on an existing approved tower or facility due
to one or more of the following reasons:
(1) Unwillingness of the owner to entertain
a cellular telephone facility proposal;
(2) The equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing approved tower
and facilities;
(3) The planned equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing or
planned equipment, which cannot be reasonably
prevented;
(4) Existing or approved towers or facilities
do not have space on which proposed equipment can
be placed so it can function effectively and
reasonably;
(5) Other reasons make it impractical to
place the equipment proposed by the applicant on
existing and approved towers or facilities.
(C) A site plan shall be approved by the Church
Hill Regional Planning Commission prior to the building
inspector issuing a permit.
(9) The following standards shall be used in design of the facilities:
(a) Setback - Minimum setback shall be twenty percent (20%)
of tower height or equal to the existing zoning district, whichever is
greater. Setback shall be measured from the base of the tower, or
guy-wire supports for lattice towers, to the property line. Ground
structures shall not be located within required setbacks;
(b) Landscaping and screening - The visual impact of a
telecommunication facility shall be mitigated from nearby views by an
evergreen screen located outside the fence. This screen may consist of
evergreen trees having a minimum height of six feet (6) at planting and
a minimum height of fifteen feet (15) at maturity, or a continuous hedge
with three feet (3) height at planting and six feet (6) height at maturity.
Sites may be exempted from the landscaping requirement provided the
building inspector finds the vegetation or the topography of the site
provides a natural buffer.
(c) Fencing - A chain-link fence or solid wall not less than eight
(8) feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-48
communication facility. Access to the facility shall be through a locked
gate.

to assure human safety or as required by the Federal Aviation
Administration. All lighting shall be oriented inward so as not to project
into surrounding property.
(e) Radiation standards - All proposed communications facilities
shall comply with current standards of the Federal Communications
Commission or American National Standards Institute for non-ionizing
electromagnetic radiation (NEIR) and electro-magnetic fields (EMF).
Each request for a building permit shall be accompanied by certified
documentation or statement from a registered engineer or other
professional indicating compliance with these standards.
(f) Aircraft hazard - Communication facilities shall not
encroach into or through any established public or private airport
approach path as established by the Federal Aviation Administration.
(g) Equipment storage - Mobile or immobile equipment not used
in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the
site unless repairs are being made.
(h) Removal of obsolete or unused facilities - All obsolete or
unused communications facilities shall be removed by the property owner
within twelve (12) months of cessation of use. The applicant shall submit
an executed removal agreement to ensure compliance with this
requirement.
(i) Signs and advertising - The use of any portion of a tower for
signs or advertising purposes, including banners, streamers, etc. is
prohibited. Warning signs or identification signs will be permitted.
(j) Maintenance - Adequate inspection and maintenance shall
be performed to insure the structural integrity of the facility and prevent
dangerous conditions occurring on the site.
(k) Access and parking - All access roads and parking areas for
facilities adjacent to platted subdivisions, or developed areas shall be
paved as required by the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations.
The requirements may be waived by the building inspector for rural or
undeveloped areas.
(l) Changes to communication facilities - Any changes to
antennae, reception, or transmitting devices shall require review in the
same manner as the existing facility was originally approved.
(10) Site plan review. In order to maintain the aesthetic characteristics
of the community and protect the safety and welfare of its citizens, site plans
shall be required for all proposed developments, excepting single-family and
two-family structures on individual lots that are not part of a planned unit
development. Prior to being issued a building permit, final site plan approval by
the planning commission shall be required, except that site plans for additions
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-49
to existing structures may be approved by the building inspector provided that
access points for the development do not change, or no more than ten (10)
parking spaces are required to be added to the site.
(11) In order to provide flexibility for the developer while protecting
existing property, the City of Church Hill provides for three (3) classifications
of site plans, with varying requirements. The three are:
(a) Concept plan. Concept site plans shall contain the following
information: location map including sufficient information to identify the
property; boundaries of the property with dimensions; scale of the plan
(1" to 40' or larger); existing and proposed zoning classification; zoning
and land use of adjoining properties; north arrow; proposed driveways
with dimensions; names and locations of public streets abutting the
property; sizes and locations of proposed structures; locations of proposed
landscape areas; name of the property owner; acreage of the property; tax
map identification number or address of the property; date of the plan;
proposed use; number of stories; total square footage of the proposed
structures; locations of existing structures (identified by dashed lines if
intended for removal); location and dimensions of parking and loading
areas; table listing the numbers of parking and loading spaces required
and the numbers proposed.
(b) Preliminary plan. Preliminary site plans shall contain the
information as described for concept plans, as well as the following
information: required setbacks; revision dates of plans (if applicable);
sizes and locations of existing utilities; general sizes and locations of
proposed utilities; dumpster/garbage collection area; paving material; and
extent of proposed paving.

3, Stormwater Management, Erosion and Sedimentation Control, of the
Church Hill Municipal Code, (detailed on a separate sheet); locations of
free-standing signs; accurate locations of proposed utilities and utility
easements; note stating that exterior lights will be positioned or shielded
in such a way that the minimum amount of light practicable spills onto
adjacent properties and rights-of-way, or into the sky.
(d) Only the Church Hill Regional Planning Commission may
amend a site plan which it has approved, except that amendments which
fully meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance may be approved by
the city building inspector and/or planning staff representative without
further action by the commission. If any question arises as to compliance,
however, the plan shall be referred to the planning commission for action.
Such amendments shall be of minor significance and shall generally
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-50
relate to adjustments of previously approved plan features. Such
amendments must meet the provisions of the zoning ordinance. Such
amended plans shall also have written on them the exact changes made.
Any plans that are amended through approval by the building inspector
and/or the planning staff representative shall be presented to the
planning commission at its next scheduled meeting and properly entered
into the minutes.
(e) Approval of a preliminary site plan shall be effective for a
period of twenty-four (24) months, during which time a final plan shall
be filed and approved. Approval of a final plan shall be affective for a
period of twenty-four (24) months, after which time the planning
commission may require submission of a new final site plan. (2003 Code,
§ 11-406)
14-407. Provisions governing use districts. (1) Low-Density
Residential Districts (R-1). The intent of the Low Density Residential District
(R-1) is to establish low density residential areas along with open areas which
appear likely to develop in a similar manner. The requirements for the district
are designed to protect essential characteristics of the district, to promote and
encourage an environment for family life and to accommodate individual and
family private living needs. In order to achieve this intent, the following
principal, accessory, special exception and prohibited uses are established:
(a) Principal uses:
(i) Single family detached dwellings;
(ii) Customary general farming ordinarily engaged in
within eastern Hawkins County;

imposed by any contractual arrangement in any subdivision, those
more restrictive conditions shall take precedence.
(c) Special exceptions, upon a finding by the board of zoning
appeals that the manner of use will be in harmony with the character of
the district, will be substantially the same character of occupancy, and
the intensity of land use is no higher and a standard of open space no
lower than that permitted in the district generally:
(i) Customary home occupations accessory to a
single-family residential dwelling provided that there is no
external evidence of the occupation except an announcement sign
not more than two (2) square feet in area; that only one person, not

(c) Day care centers.
(4) Planned Unit Development District (R-4). It is the intent of this
conditional rezoning district to allow, coordinate and regulate large scale or
comprehensive group developments which may not follow standard design
practices. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) will allow increased densities, the
grouping of housing, open spaces and setbacks that are not traditional. It is the
intent that the development will contain a diversity of housing types to enable
citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live within its
boundaries.
(a) Conditions for rezoning:
(i) Ownership: All of the land contained within a
proposed PUD must be owned at the time of application for

allocated by:
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-53
(A) A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the land
area shall be for single-family residential development if
multi-family development is proposed,
(B) No more than twenty percent (20%) of the land
area shall be used for multi-family development and said
units shall not be located next to any adjacent pre-existing
single-family residential units and
(C) At least thirty percent (30%) of the land area,
not including streets, shall be open space in common
ownership of the PUD's homeowners association.
(D) In no case shall development exceed seventy
percent (70%) of the total land area.
(v) Density: The gross density for a PUD shall not exceed
twelve (12) units per acre.
(vi) Streets: All streets within the PUD shall be private
and constructed to the specifications of Church Hill as to street
widths, street grade, and construction standards.

commission.
(b) Preliminary site plan/zoning approval: The preliminary
approval process shall commence with the submission of a request to the
planning commission for a zone reclassification to R-4 and a preliminary
site plan. Once approved by the planning commission, the city clerk shall
submit the planning commission's positive recommendation for R-4
zoning to the Church Hill Board of Mayor and Alderman for a public
notice, public hearing and final ordinance action to conditionally amend
the official zoning map. Copies of the preliminary site plan shall be
available for public review at city hall prior to and during the public
hearing.
As a condition of the zoning action, failure of the developer to
obtain final site plan approval, necessary permits, and start of
construction within one (1) year of final ordinance approval by the
Church Hill Board of Mayor and Alderman will:
(i) Void the planning commission's preliminary site plan
approval and
(ii) The zoning of the property will revert back to its
original zone prior to the PUD request.
(c) Final site plan approval:
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-54

14-409. Exceptions and modifications. (1) Lot of record. Where the
owner of a lot consisting of one (1) or more adjacent lots of official record at the
time of the adoption of this chapter does not own sufficient land to enable him
to conform to the yard or other requirements of this chapter, an application may
be submitted to the board of zoning appeals for a variance from the terms of this
chapter, in accordance with § 14-411(4)(c). Such lot may be used as a building
site, provided, however, that the yard and other requirements of the district are
complied with as close as is possible in the opinion of the board of zoning
appeals.
(2) Front yards. The front yard requirements of this chapter for
dwellings shall not apply to any lot where the average depth of existing front
yards on developed lots, located within one hundred (100) feet on each side of
such lot and within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same
street as such lot, is less than the minimum required front yard depth. In such
case, the minimum front yard shall be the average of the existing front yard
depths on the developed lots.
(3) Group housing project. In the case of a group housing project of two
(2) or more buildings to be constructed on a plot of ground of at least one (1) acre
not subdivided or where the existing or contemplated street and lot layouts
make it impractical to apply the requirements of this chapter to the individual
building units in such housing projects, the application of the terms of this
chapter may be varied by the board of zoning appeals in a manner that will be
in harmony with the character of the neighborhood, will insure substantially the
same character of occupancy and intensity of land use is no higher and a
standard of open space no lower than that permitted by this chapter in the
district in which the proposed project is to be located. However, in no case shall
the board of zoning appeals authorize a use prohibited in the district in which
the project is to be located, or a smaller lot area per family than the minimum
required in such district, or a greater height, or a larger coverage than the
requirements of this chapter permit in such district.
(4) Exception of height limits. The height limitations of this chapter
shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for
human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission
towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, derricks, conveyers, flag poles, radio
towers, mast and aerials. (2003 Code, § 11-409)

construction of any building including accessory buildings, or to

commence the moving or alteration of any building, including accessory
buildings, until the building inspector has issued a building permit for
such work. No connection to any utility shall be made by any individual
or corporation until the issuance of a building permit.
(b) Issuance of a building permit. In applying to the building
inspector for a building permit, the applicant shall submit a dimensional
sketch or a scale plan indicating the shape, size, height and location on
the lot of all buildings to be erected, altered or moved and of any building
already on the lot. He shall also state the existing and intended use of all
such buildings and supply such other information as may be required by
the building inspector for determining whether proposed excavation or
construction as set forth in the application are in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter and other ordinances of the City of Church Hill,
then in force. The building inspector shall issue a building permit for such
excavation or construction. If a building permit is refused, the building
inspector shall state such refusal in writing, with the cause.
(i) The issuance of a permit shall in no case be construed
as waiving any provision of this chapter.
(ii) A building permit shall become void twelve (12)
months from the date of issuance unless substantial progress has
been made by that date on the project described therein.
(c) Certificate of occupancy. No land or building or part thereof
hereafter erected or altered in its use or structure shall be used until the
building inspector shall have issued a certificate of occupancy stating that
such land, building, or part thereof, and the proposed use thereof, are
found to be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Within five
(5) days after notification that a building or premises or part thereof, is
ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the building inspector
to make a final inspection thereof and to issue a certificate of occupancy
if the land, building, or part thereof, and the proposed use thereof are
found to conform with the provisions of this chapter; or, if such certificate
is refused, to state such refusal in writing with the cause.
(d) Records. A complete record of such application, sketches,
and plans shall be maintained in the office of the building inspector.
(3) Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than two
($2.00) dollars nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each offense. Each day
such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
(4) Remedies. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or
land is used in violation of this chapter, the building inspector or any other
appropriate authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would
be damaged by such violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-62
injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action in proceeding to prevent the
occupancy or use of such building, structure, or land. (2003 Code, § 11-410)
14-411. Board of zoning appeals. (1) Creation and appointment. A
board of zoning appeals is hereby established in accordance with Tennessee

be taken by any person, firm, or corporation aggrieved, or by any governmental

inspector based in whole or in part upon the provisions of this chapter. Such
appeal shall be taken by filing with the board of zoning appeals a notice of
appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The building inspector shall transmit to
the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was
taken. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give

the terms of this chapter, but only where, by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the
time of the adoption of this chapter was a lot of record; or where, by
reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property the strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would result in exceptional
practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-63
owner of such property, provided that such relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially
impairing the intent and purpose of this ordinance as specifically
authorized in 14-409(1) and (3).

such conditions regarding the location, character and other
features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem
advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter.

generally apply to other property in the neighborhood. (2003 Code,
§ 11-411)

amendment to this chapter or upon the receipt of a petition to amend this
chapter, the board of mayor and aldermen shall publish a notice of such request

Tennessee has in §§ 13-7-201 through 13-7-210, Tennessee Code Annotated
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City of Church Hill, Tennessee, Mayor and Board of
Aldermen, do ordain as follows:
(2) Findings of fact. (a) The City of Church Hill, Tennessee, Mayor
and its legislative body wishes to maintain eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the
NFIP regulations found in title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR), ch. 1, § 60.3.

periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(c) Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or
construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;

channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.
(4) Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are:
(a) To protect human life, health, safety and property;
(b) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;

(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodprone areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in
flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a floodprone area;
(h) To maintain eligibility for participation in the NFIP. (2003

and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential
building, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated or floodproofed to no lower than three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (as defined in § 14-602). Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate
equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of this section:
"enclosures."
Non-residential buildings located in all A zones may be
floodproofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the
building below the required elevation are watertight, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are built with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such
certification to the administrator as set forth in § 14-604(2).
(c) Enclosures. All new construction and substantial
improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding,
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-85
for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(i) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a Tennessee professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
(A) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having
a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the finished grade;
(C) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(ii) The enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles, storage of building access,
(iii) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
finished or partitioned into separate rooms in such a way as to
impede the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall
comply with the provisions of § 14-605(2).
(d) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles.
(i) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially
improved, on:
(A) Individual lots or parcels,
(B) In expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions, or
(C) In new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all
the requirements of new construction.
(ii) All manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that either:
(A) In AE zones when base flood elevations, the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a
permanent foundation to no lower than one foot (1') above
the level of the base flood elevation; or,
(B) In approximate A zones, without base flood
elevations, the manufactured home chassis is elevated and
supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements
of at least equivalent strength) that are at least three feet
(3') in height above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in
§ 14-602).
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-86
(iii) Any manufactured home, which has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must meet the
standards of § 14-605(1) and (2).
(iv) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
(v) All recreational vehicles placed in an identified
special flood hazard area must either:
(A) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days;
(B) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed,
on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached structures or additions), or;
(C) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction.
(e) Standards for subdivisions and other proposed new
development proposals. Subdivisions and other proposed new
developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to
determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(i) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
(ii) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(iii) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
(iv) In all approximate A zones require that all new
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater
than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, include
within such proposals base flood elevation data (see § 14-605(5)).
(3) Standards for special flood hazard areas with established base flood
elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the special flood
hazard area established in § 14-603(2), are areas designated as floodways. A
floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters,
debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of
encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall
apply:
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-87
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development, shall not result in any increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the
occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community.
A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide supporting
technical data using the same methodologies as in the effective flood
insurance study for the City of Church Hill, Tennessee and certification
thereof.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings,
where prohibited, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of § 14-605(1) and (2).
(4) Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located
within the special flood hazard areas established in § 14-603, where streams
exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new structures
or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood
hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings,
where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of § 14-605(1) and (2).
(5) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or
floodways (A zones). Located within the special flood hazard areas established
in § 14-603(2), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided
and where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall
apply:
(a) The administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from any
federal, state, or other sources, including data developed as a result of
these regulations (see (b) below), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development in
approximate A zones meet the requirements of § 14-605(1) and (2).
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-88
(b) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home
parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation
data.
(c) Within approximate A zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or
floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent
grade (as defined in § 14-602). All applicable data including elevations
or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-604(2).
Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of § 14-605(2).
(d) Within approximate A zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet (20'), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream
bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer
is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the City of Church Hill,
Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles
(e) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 14-605(1) and (2). Within approximate A zones,
require that those subsections of § 14-605(2) dealing with the alteration
or relocation of a watercourse, ass\lling watercourse carrying capacities
are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as
required.
(6) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones).
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 14-603(2) are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1'-3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition
to those set forth in § 14-605(1) and (2) apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above as many feet
as the depth number specified on the FIRMs, in feet, above the highest
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-89
adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, to at least three feet
(3') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of § 14-605(2).
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at
least one foot (1') above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be flood proofed to at least
three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required
in accordance with § 14-604(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(7) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 14-603(2), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 zones) all provisions of §§ 14-604 and 14-605 shall apply.
(8) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within Church Hill,
Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are
neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) No encroachments including fill material or other
development including structures shall be located within an area of at
least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of
each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing
and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
locality.
(b) When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation
and floodway data is available, new construction or substantial
improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-90
§§ 14-604 and 14-605. (2003 Code, § 11-605, as replaced by Ord. #13-459,

of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes
of this ordinance.
(E) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard and the factors listed in § 14-606(1).
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance (as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) coverage, and that such construction below the base flood level
increases risks to life and property.

OFF-SITE DRAINAGE
SECTION
14-701. Purpose.
14-702. Off-site drainage plan required.
14-703. Review by city engineer and planning commission approval.
14-704. Construction of drainage facilities in accordance with approved off-site
drainage plan.
14-705. Alternate method for payment of construction costs for off-site drainage
facilities.
14-706. Engineers report to city.
14-701. Purpose. Whenever the construction of a subdivision,
development or improvement may cause, contribute, or add to existing or
proposed surface water runoff drainage (facilities other than those required to
provide internal drainage within such construction) such sub-divider, developer
or improver shall be required to follow the sections hereinafter appearing. (2003
Code, § 11-701)
14-702. Off-site drainage plan required. Each sub-divider, developer,
or improver shall submit to the Church Hill Regional Planning Commission in
triplicate an off-site drainage plan which shall be based upon the national
method of run-off calculation and the ten-year storm frequency. (2003 Code,
§ 11-702)
14-703. Review by city engineer and planning commission
approval. After receiving a recommendation from the city engineer, the
planning commission shall approve or disapprove said plan. In the event of
disapproval, the planning commission shall state its reasons therefore to the
applicant. The planning commission shall include the following in any approval
of off-site drainage plans:
(1) The off-site drainage plan must be approved by the planning
commission prior to the approval of any final subdivision plan.
(2) The off-site drainage plan must route the storm water run off to an
existing or natural water course in such a manner as to prevent damage to
downstream property owners.
(3) A natural or existing water course is defined herein as one where
the water has been accustomed to gather and/or flow a well-defined channel
which frequent running has worked or cut into the soil.
(4) The applicant (landowner) shall have the responsibility of securing
at no cost to the city such necessary perpetual drainage easements to effectuate
the approved plan.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-94
(5) The planning commission may require the applicant (landowner)
to post a bond with good and sufficient surety to assure completion of the plan.
(6) The planning commission may impose such other reasonable
conditions upon the approval of the plans as recommended by the city engineer.
(2003 Code, § 11-703)
14-704. Construction of drainage facilities in accordance with
approved off-site drainage plan. The applicant (landowner) shall construct
the said off-site drainage facilities in accordance with the plans and
specifications and pay for all of the other cost of off-site drainage facilities or so
much thereof as the city engineer shall direct. (2003 Code, § 11-704)
14-705. Alternate method for payment of construction costs for
off-site drainage facilities. As an alternative method of payment for the cost
of off-site drainage facilities, the sub-divider, developer, or improver may:
(1) Contribute his pro-rata share of local funds expended for
construction of off-site drainage facilities or contribute his pro-rata share of local
funds estimated to pay for the construction of off-site drainage facilities that
controls storm water flow in a designated area or the acquisition of property
needed for the addition of such facilities. Local funds do not include funds
received by the city from federal or state government grants.
(2) The pro-rata share to be contributed by the subdividers, developers
and improver shall be calculated as follows:
(3) Drainage areas shall be designated by the planning commission in
accordance with sound engineering principles, upon recommendation by the city
engineer.
(4) Off-site drainage facilities needed to properly control present and
anticipated storm water flow in such areas designed by the city engineer in
accordance with sound engineering principles taking into consideration (among
other things) the zoning and zoning patterns of the subject drainage area, the
duration and frequency of rainfall in such area during a storm return period of
ten (10) years using U.S. Department of Commerce curves and statistics and
suitable run-off coefficients as determined by the city engineer for the different
types of zoning in such areas.
(5) The total cost of such off-site facilities (including land or easement
acquisition and any other incidental costs) shall be estimated by the city
engineer based upon current prices plus a percentage of such cost rise over the
ensuing five (5) years. Such cost rise estimate will be determined by the use of
U.S. Department of Labor consumer price indices to project price increase
trends.
(6) The design and estimated cost of such off-site drainage facilities
shall be re-evaluated every five (5) years prior to construction. Any changes in
cost estimates shall be reflected by either an increase or decrease in those
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-95
pro-rata shares remaining to be paid. A rebate shall be made to those having
already contributed their share if a decrease in pro rata share is calculated.
(7) A construction fund for each drainage area shall be established by
the city to which pro-rata shares shall be contributed by the developer prior to
final approval. Shares paid after construction for an off-site drainage facility
shall be based upon actual cost and shall be paid to the city. A rebate shall be
made to those developers having contributed prior to construction if the actual
cost of construction is less than the previous estimate.
(8) The pro-rata share of each developer or entity shall be calculated
by estimating that portion of the total storm water run off using said off-site
facilities which can be attributed to the subject developer taking into
consideration the size and type of the proposed development, the amount of
rainfall anticipated in said development and the appropriate run-off coefficients
applicable thereto. The cost of enlarged or additional off-site drainage facilities,
the need for which is created by actions taken by the sub-dividers, developers,
or improver after cost estimates have been made by the city's engineer, shall be
borne by such developer.
(9) The pro-rata share for construction occurring in an area served by
off-street drainage shall be calculated by estimating that portion of the total
storm water run-off using said off-site facilities which can be attributed to the
new construction taking into consideration the size and type of the proposed
construction, the amount of rainfall anticipated in said development, the
appropriate run-off coefficient thereto and the construction of such off-site
drainage facility.
(10) In determining the pro-rata share of costs between the developer
and the city, the city will be responsible for upgrading any existing storm
facilities which are owned and maintained by the City of Church Hill at the time
of the formulation of the off-site drainage plan. It shall be presumed that such
existing facilities will adequately carry storm water run-off from the area
assuming no new development. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to
pay the cost of improving existing storm water handling facilities to the point
that such facilities are adequate to handle any and all additional flow which
may occur as a result of the development plus any storm water flow occurring
on the watershed which is directed into the existing storm water facilities as a
result of the new development. (2003 Code, § 11-705)
14-706. Engineers report to city. Once the off-site drainage plans have
been approved by the planning commission, the city engineer will provide the
city an estimated cost of the improvements with a break-down of the pro-rata
share(s) as described above. The city shall determine whether or not the
proposed pro-rata costs are in order, and, if such costs are approved, will present
these costs to the developer. The city will provide whenever possible, labor and
equipment for installation of storm drainage facilities as their pro-rata share of
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-96
the cost. Hourly rates shall be based upon typical costs in the area and will be
updated periodically. (2003 Code, § 11-706)

14-807. Illicit connections prohibited. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued use of illicit connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made
in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or
practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. In addition, a person
is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to the storm drain
system. (2003 Code, § 11-807)
14-808. Suspension of MS4 access. (1) Suspension due to illicit
discharges in emergency situations. The City of Church Hill may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, health or welfare
of persons or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator falls to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement
agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
(2) Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency shall notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the board of mayor and
aldermen for a reconsideration and healing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency. (2003 Code, § 11-808)
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-102
14-809. Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person
subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge
permit shall comply with all provisions of said permit and/or title 14, chapter 3
of the Church Hill City Code. Proof of said permit may be required by the City
of Church Hill prior to allowing a discharge to the MS4. (2003 Code, § 11-809)
14-810. Monitoring of discharges. This section applies to all facilities
that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity, which is more thoroughly covered in title 14, chapter 3.
(1) The City of Church Hill shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary
to determine compliance. If a discharger has security measures in force that
require proper identification and clearance before entry in/onto its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the City of Church Hill ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater and the performance of any additional duties
as defined by state and federal law.
(3) The City of Church Hill shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The City of Church Hill shall have the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater quantity and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City of Church Hill and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Church Hill access to
a permitted facility is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator
of a stormwater facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with an industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies
the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
(7) If the City of Church Hill has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and there is evidence to indicate
probable cause of a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-103
to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction. (2003 Code, § 11-810)
14-811. Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of BMPs. The City of Church Hill will identify BMPs
for any activity, operation or facility that may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the state.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide,
at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said persons
expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practical, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit. (2003 Code, § 11-811)
14-812. Watercourse protection. Every person owning property
through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris
and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse. Any significant alteration of
a watercourse must be permitted by the TDEC Division of Water Pollution
Control. (2003 Code, § 11-812)
14-813. Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of
law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible
for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known
or suspected release of materials that are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system,
or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement
agency in person or by phone no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-104
to the City of Church Hill within three (3) business days of the notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. (2003
Code, § 11-813)
14-814. Enforcement. Notice of violation. Whenever the City of Church
Hill finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a
requirement of this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order
compliance by written notice of a violation to the responsible person. Such notice
may require any or all of the following without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analysis and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement and remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
(5) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail
to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done
by a designated governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense thereof
shall be charged to the violator. (2003 Code, § 11-814)
14-815. Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice
of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement agency
directly to the board of mayor and aldermen. The notice of appeal must be
received within fifteen (15) days from the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal shall take place at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the "board,"
or a special called meeting. The decision of the "board" or its designee shall be
final. (2003 Code, § 11-814)
14-816. Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not
been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation,
or, in the event of an appeal, within thirty (30) days of the decision of the
"board" upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement agency, then
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall enter upon the
subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful
for any person, owner or agent in possession of any premises to refuse to allow
the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above. (2003 Code, § 11-816)
Change 2, June 21, 2016 14-105
14-817. Cost of abatement of the violation. Within fifteen (15) days
after the abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified
of the cost of abatement of the violation, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within thirty (30) days. If the amount due is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by

the construction of driveways as herein defined so as to prevent insofar as
possible the drainage of water and debris into the street of the city and to
require the installation of drainage tile so as to prevent the deterioration and
damage to said streets and to require proper and adequate drainage along street
where necessary to prevent said damage. (2003 Code, § 12-301)
16-302. Installation of tile may be required. The mayor, or any
official designated by him may, for the protection of the streets of the city,
require the owner of any lot or any part of a lot in the city adjoining a public
street to install tile or other carrier of water in the drainage ditch at any point
where a driveway enters the street from such lot. The tile shall be of a
reasonable size and material prescribed by the mayor or other designated
official. (2003 Code, § 12-302)

adjoins the street right-of-way, a tile sufficient to carry the maximum amount
of water anticipated, but in no event shall said tile be less than twelve (12)
inches in diameter. Provided however, that this section shall not apply to a
driveway at the crest of a hill where water will not drain from above. (2003

alteration, or change, the property owner shall obtain a permit to do so from the
city recorder. The fee for such permits shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) each.
Before such construction, reconstruction, improvement, alteration, or change is
substantially completed, the property owner shall notify the city recorder of
same. The city recorder shall cause an inspection thereof, and give final
approval that such activity complies with the rules and regulations as noted
above. The property owner shall be required to make whatever alterations and
corrections are necessary and required by the city recorder prior to final
approval being given for same. (2003 Code, § 12-304)
16-305. Property owner responsible for installing tile; lien on
property if city does. The property owner of any lot abutting upon a

tile, the city, as an alternative and in the discretion of the mayor, or other
designated official, may direct the recorder to give the owner of the abutting lot
or lots written notice specifically setting forth the work to be done and the
length of time in which same must be done provided that the time fixed thereby
shall not be less than thirty (30) days. If the owner of said lot or lots shall
thereafter fail or refuse to build or install said tiles or other carriers of water
within the time required by said notice and in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the mayor, or other
designated official, the city may do the work or contract for doing same and pay
the cost thereof out of the street funds. In the event that the work is done in
this manner, all amounts paid by the city shall become a lien upon such lot or
property and may be enforced by attachment at law or in equity or in any other
manner provided by law and the amount may be recovered against said owner
or owners by suit before any court of competent jurisdiction. The city attorney
is authorized to proceed to enforce the lien declared and fixed by law under this
chapter. (2003 Code, § 12-305)
16-306. Drainage of wastes into streets prohibited. All persons are
prohibited from discharging any waste, refuse, garbage, or drainage water of
any type, except surface rain water, into any street of the city. (2003 Code,
§ 12-306)
16-307. Supplementary enforcement authority. In addition to all
other methods of enforcement authorized or described herein the city may
16-10
correct any violation hereof by making the installation necessary or correcting
any construction, reconstruction, or alteration so as to make the same comply
with the provisions of this chapter and may recover from the offending party,
including the owner of the property and/or any lessee, tenant, contractor, or
subcontractor, the actual amount expended by the city in correcting the violation
or bringing the construction into conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case
heat polluted wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 40EC (104EF), unless the
director approves alternate temperature limits.
(f) Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass
through.
(g) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.
(h) Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the director.
(i) Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair.

(u) Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could
be discharged to the POTW. (2003 Code, § 13-305)
18-306. Restrictions on wastewater strength. No user shall
discharge wastewater which exceeds the standards set out herein in Table "A,"
User Discharge Restrictions, unless an exception is permitted in this title.
Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying these
requirements shall be considered a violation of this title.
The director shall monitor the treatment works influent for each
parameter in Table "A." Non-domestic users shall be subject to reporting and
monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth in Table "A"
below. In the event that the influent at the POTW reaches or exceeds the
established allowable loadings for these parameters, the director shall initiate
technical studies to determine the cause of the influent violation and shall
recommend to the board of mayor and aldermen the necessary remedial
measures, including but not limited to establishment of new or revised
pretreatment levels for these parameters. The director shall also recommend
changes to any of these criteria in the event that the POTW effluent standards
are changed, there are changes in any applicable law or regulation affecting
same, or changes are needed for more effective operation of the POTW.
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. Unless specifically authorized by the terms of a
wastewater discharge permit or special agreement as authorized by § 18-105,
no user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily
maximum or monthly average allowable discharge limits:

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. All concentrations of metallic substances are for "total" metal
unless indicated otherwise. The director may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (2003 Code, § 13-306)
18-307. Application for exception to discharge criteria.
Non-domestic users of the POTW may apply for a temporary exception to the
wastewater discharge restrictions established by § 18-306. Exceptions may be
granted according to the guidelines set out herein below. The director shall
allow applications for temporary exceptions at any time, however, the director
shall not accept an application if the applicant has submitted the same or
substantially similar application within the preceding year and the same has
been denied. Any exception granted shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days.
Upon finding that the POTW treatment process may be jeopardized, the
director may revoke an exception. (2003 Code, § 13-307)
18-308. Conditions applicable to exceptions. A user requesting an
exception shall demonstrate to the director that he is making a concentrated
18-25
and serious effort to maintain high standards of operation control so that
restricted discharges to the POTW are being minimized. If negligence is found,
exceptions will be subject to termination. A user requesting an exception must
demonstrate that compliance with stated concentration and quantity standards
is technically or economically infeasible and the discharge, if excepted, will not:
(1) Interfere with collection or the operation of the POTW;
(2) Limit sludge management alternatives or increase the cost of
providing adequate sludge management; or
(3) Pass through the POTW in quantities or concentrations that would
cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit. (2003 Code, § 13-308)
18-309. Review of application for exception by the director. All
applications for exception shall be reviewed by the director. If the application
does not contain sufficient information for complete evaluation the director shall
notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information. The
applicant shall have thirty (30) days following the notification by the director to
correct such deficiencies. This thirty day period may be extended upon approval
and for just cause shown. Upon receipt of a complete application, the director
shall evaluate same within thirty (30) days and make a determination. The
director shall consider:
(1) Whether or not the applicant is subject to a national categorical
pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more stringent than
those in § 18-306. No exception will be granted if the national categorical
pretreatment standard is equal to or more stringent than the discharge
restrictions listed in § 18-306;
(2) Whether or not the exception would apply to discharge of a
substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the
EPA under provisions of 33 U.S.C. § 1317, and then grant an exception only if
such exception is within limitations of applicable federal regulations;
(3) Whether or not the granting of an exception would create
conditions that would reduce the effectiveness of the treatment works taking
into consideration the concentration of said pollutant in the treatment works
influent and the design capability of the treatment works;
(4) The age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to the
extent that such factors affect the quality of wastewater discharge;
(5) The process employed by the user and process changes available
which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge;
(6) The engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or other
control techniques available to the user to improve the quality or quantity of
wastewater discharge.
The appeals board shall hear appeals from the director's decisions. (2003
Code, § 13-309)

18-404. Hauled non-domestic wastewater.
18-401. Availability of system. (1) Where the POTW is not available
under the provision of § 18-301, the building sewer shall be connected to a
private wastewater disposal system complying with provisions of this chapter.
(2) For any residence used for human occupancy where the building
is below the elevation to obtain proper grade of the gravity service line, but is
otherwise accessible to a public sewer, the owner may provide a pump suitable
for this type of service to provide the necessary lift for the building service. For
all other uses where toilet facilities are employed, including office, recreational
facility or other establishments used for human occupancy, where the building
is below the elevation to obtain proper grade of the gravity service line, but is
otherwise accessible to a public sewer, the owner shall provide a pump suitable
for this type service to provide the necessary lift for the building service. In any
of the above situations, the owner shall be responsible for the maintenance or
replacement of the pump.
(3) When a public sewer becomes available, connection shall be made
to said sewer within sixty (60) days after date of official notice to do so, and any
septic tank or other private disposal facility shall be abandoned. (2003 Code,
§ 13-401, as amended by Ord. #11-445, July 2011)
18-402. Requirements for private domestic systems. (1) Private
domestic wastewater disposal systems shall not be constructed within the city
until a letter is obtained from the director stating that a public sewer is not
accessible to the property and no such sewer is proposed for construction in the
immediate future. No letter shall be issued for any private domestic wastewater
disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area
of the lot is less than that specified by the state or the Hawkins County Health
Department.
(2) Before commencement of construction of a private wastewater
disposal system, the owner shall obtain a written permit from the appropriate
state or county agency. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to supply any
plans, specifications, and other information needed by such agency(ies).
(3) Private wastewater disposal systems shall not be placed in
operation until the installation is approved by the county or state. The work
may be inspected at any stage of construction and in any event, the owner shall
notify the state or county when the work is ready for final inspection, and before
any underground portions are covered.
(4) The type, capacity, location and layout of a private wastewater
disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the appropriate
18-27
agency of the state. No septic tanks or cesspools shall be permitted to discharge
to the waters of the state except as specifically permitted for the appropriate
system.
(5) The owner shall operate and maintain the private wastewater
disposal facility in a sanitary manner at all times, at the owner's expense.
(6) No part of this title shall be construed to interfere with any
additional requirements that may be imposed by the state. (2003 Code,
§ 13-402)
18-403. Regulation of holding tank waste disposal. (1) Permit. No
person shall clean out, drain or flush any septic tank or any other type of
wastewater or excreta disposal system within the city unless such person
obtains a permit from the director to perform such acts or services. Any person
desiring a permit to perform such services shall file an application on the
prescribed form. Upon such application, a permit shall be issued by the director
when the conditions of this chapter have been met, provided the director is
satisfied the applicant has adequate and proper equipment to perform the
services contemplated in a safe and competent manner. The director may
require domestic septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge
permits.
(2) Fees. For each permit issued under the provisions of this chapter,
an annual fee shall be paid as established by resolution of the board of mayor
and aldermen. Any such permit granted shall be for one (1) full fiscal year or
fraction of the fiscal year, and shall continue in full force and effect from the
time issued until the ending of the fiscal year unless sooner revoked, and shall
be nontransferable. The number of the permit granted hereunder shall be
plainly painted on each side of each motor vehicle used in the conduct of the
business permitted hereunder.
(3) Designated disposal locations. The director shall designate
approved locations for the emptying and cleaning of all equipment used in the
performance of the services rendered as provided for, and it shall be a violation
for any person to empty or clean such equipment at any place other than a place
so designated.
(4) Revocation of permit. Failure to comply with all provisions of this
title shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of such permit by the director.
The possession within the service area by any persons of any motor vehicle
equipped with a body type and accessories of a nature and design capable of
serving a septic tank of wastewater or excreta disposal system cleaning unit
shall be prima facie evidence that such person is engaged in the business of
cleaning, draining, or flushing septic tanks or other wastewater or excreta
disposal systems within the service area of the City of Church Hill. (2003 Code,
§ 13-403)
18-28
18-404. Hauled non-domestic wastewater. Non-domestic waste
haulers shall be subject to all the provisions of § 18-403, and, in addition:
(1) The director shall require haulers of non-domestic waste or
wastewater to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may require
generators of hauled non-domestic waste to obtain wastewater discharge
permits. The director may also prohibit the disposal in the POTW of hauled
non-domestic waste. The discharge of hauled non-domestic waste is subject to
all other requirements of this title.
(2) Non-domestic waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the director and with the prior consent of the director. The
director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with
applicable standards. The director may require non-domestic waste haulers to
provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(3) Non-domestic waste haulers shall provide a waste-tracking form
for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address
of the non-domestic waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names
and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents,
and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. (2003 Code, § 13-404)

SECTION
18-501. National categorical pretreatment standards.
18-502. Pretreatment facilities.
18-503. Additional pretreatment measures.
18-504. Dilution.
18-505. New sources.
18-501. National categorical pretreatment standards. (1) The
categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N,
parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference, the same as if copied
verbatim herein.
(2) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with
40 CFR 403.6(c).
(3) When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall
impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR
403.6(e).
(4) A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing
the categorical pretreatment standard.
(5) A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. (2003 Code, § 13-501)
18-502. Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater
pretreatment as necessary to comply with § 18-306 of this title and shall achieve
compliance with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and local
limits within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the director,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city
for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before such facilities are
constructed. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user of the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this title.
(2003 Code, § 13-502)
18-30
18-503. Additional pretreatment measures. (1) Whenever deemed
necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak
flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with
requirements of this title.
(2) The director may require, provided just cause exists, any user
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization
of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
(3) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease, oil or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interception units
shall be of type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located so as
to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned and repaired as needed, by the user at their expense.
(4) Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may
be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
(5) Any industrial, commercial or manufacturing facility having upon
the premises any raw material, intermediate material, finished products,
byproducts, residue, waste material or other substance that has the potential
to adversely impact the POTW, the environment, or the health or safety of
POTW personnel may be ordered, at the discretion of the director, to sample or
monitor the wastewater stream at the expense of the user. (2003 Code,
§ 13-503)
18-504. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the volume of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who use
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (2003 Code,
§ 13-504)
18-505. New sources. New sources shall install and have in operating
condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable national categorical pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge. Within the shortest time feasible (not to exceed ninety (90) days),
18-31
new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. Except where
expressly authorized by an applicable national pretreatment standard, no
industrial user shall increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with such standard. (2003 Code, § 13-505)

evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application.
18-34
Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and shall be
returned to the user for revision or completion. Said application shall be
re-submitted within thirty (30) days. (2003 Code, § 13-605)
18-606. Application signatures and certification. All non-domestic
wastewater discharge permit applications and any reports required by this title
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the
following certification:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a
system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person
or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible
for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that
there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including
the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. (2003
Code, § 13-606)
18-607. Applications by significant industrial users and
categorical users. (1) All significant industrial users (SIUs) or categorical
users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file
with the director an application accompanied by the wastewater discharge
permit fee established by resolution of the board of mayor and aldermen.
Existing unpermitted categorical users shall apply for a wastewater discharge
permit within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this title. All other
existing unpermitted SIUs shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within
one hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date. Proposed SIUs shall
apply at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to connecting to or
contributing to the POTW. The director may reduce or extend the deadline for
new discharge applications.
(2) The application shall be on a form prescribed by the city and shall
include but not be limited to the following information: Name, address, location
if different from address and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
number of the applicant; wastewater volume; wastewater constituents and
characteristics; discharge variations; description of all toxic materials handled
on the premises; details showing all POTW connections by size, location and
elevation; description of existing and proposed pretreatment facilities and other
information deemed necessary by the director. Such additional information may
include but is not limited to site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing
plans, and details showing all sewer appurtenances by size, location and
elevation.
(3) Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria for an SIU has no
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
18-35
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may at any time,
on its own initiative or in response to a petition from a user, and in accordance
with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should not be
considered a significant industrial user.
(4) As part of the application for a wastewater discharge permit, any
user who elects or is required to construct new or additional facilities for
pretreatment shall submit plans, specifications and other pertinent information
relative to the proposed construction to the director for approval. Plans and
specifications submitted for approval must bear the seal of a professional
engineer registered to practice engineering in the state. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be issued until such plans and specifications are approved.
Approval of such plans and specifications shall in no way relieve a user of the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent which
complies with the terms of this title and an applicable wastewater discharge
permit.
(5) If additional pretreatment, operation or maintenance will be
required to meet pretreatment standards, the application shall include the
shortest completion schedule by which the user will provide such additional
pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. For the
purpose of this section, "pretreatment standards" shall include either a national
pretreatment standard, as specified in title 40 CFR, Protection of the
Environment, or a pretreatment standard imposed by chapter 5 of this title.
(6) The following conditions shall apply to a completion schedule:

whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
(g) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment
standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance
schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in
§ 18-702 of this title. (2003 Code, § 13-701)
18-702. Compliance schedule progress reports. The following
conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by § 18-701(2)(g) of
this title:
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing
contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and
beginning and conducting routine operation);
18-43
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later
than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
(4) In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the director. (2003 Code, § 13-702)
18-703. Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment
standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case
of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements
shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in
§ 18-701(2)(d-g) of this title. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's
actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 18-606 of this title.
(2003 Code, § 13-703)
18-704. Periodic compliance reports. (1) All significant industrial
users shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than
twice per year, in March and September, submit a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period.
(2) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order
shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the
procedures prescribed in § 18-710 of this title, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report. (2003 Code, § 13-704)
18-705. Reports of changed conditions. (1) Each user shall notify
the director of any changes to the user's operations or system which may alter
18-44
the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before
any planned change occurs, or as early as practicable under the circumstances
in all other cases.
(2) The director may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §§ 18-601 et
seq., of this title.
(3) The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
chapter 6 of this title or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§ 18-610 of this title in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions. (2003 Code, § 13-705)
18-706. Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide such reports as the director
may require. (2003 Code, § 13-706)
18-707. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If
sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the
director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. (2003 Code, § 13-707)
18-708. Notification of accidental discharge and control plans.
(1) Protection from accidental discharge. All non-domestic users shall
provide such facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary
to prevent or minimize the potential for accidental discharge into the POTW
from liquid or raw material storage areas, truck and rail car loading and
unloading areas, in-plant transfer or processing and materials-handling areas,
and from diked areas or holding ponds. The wastewater discharge permit of any
user who has a history of significant leaks, spills or other accidental discharge
of waste regulated by this title shall be subject, on a case by case basis, to a
special permit condition or the requirement for the construction of facilities and
establishment of procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for
such accidental discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans of facilities and operating procedures required by this subsection
shall be submitted to the director before the facility is constructed. Review and
approval of said plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
of responsibility for modifying the facility to provide the protection necessary to
meet the requirements of this title.
(2) Notification of accidental discharge. Any person causing or
suffering any accidental discharge shall, immediately upon becoming aware of
such discharge, notify the director or his designated representative by telephone
18-45
to enable counter-measures to be taken to minimize damage to the POTW, the
health and welfare of the public, and the environment. This notification shall
include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. This notification shall be
followed within five (5) days of the date of the occurrence by a detailed written
statement describing the cause of the accidental discharge and measures being
taken to prevent future occurrence. Upon request by a user, the director may
grant an exception to the written notification requirement. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss or damage to the
POTW, natural resources, fish kills, or any other damage to persons or property;
nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this title or state or federal law.
(3) Notice to employees. Employers shall ensure that all employees
who may cause, suffer, or become aware of, such discharges are aware of the
emergency notification procedure.
(4) Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation of
this title. (2003 Code, § 13-708)
18-709. Slug reporting and control. All users shall provide such
facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent
or minimize the potential for slug discharges.
(1) Any user who has a history of slug discharges shall be subject, on
a case by case basis, to a requirement to construct facilities and establish
procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for slug discharges.
Such facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans of facilities and operating procedures required by this sub-section shall be
submitted to the director before the facility is constructed. Review and approval
of said plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of
responsibility for modifying the facility to provide the protection necessary to
meet the requirements of this title.
(2) Any person causing or suffering any slug discharge shall,
immediately upon becoming aware of such discharge, notify the director or his
designated representative by telephone to enable counter-measures to be taken
to minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of the public, and the
environment. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user. This notification shall be followed within five (5) days of the date of
the occurrence by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the slug
discharge and measures being taken to prevent future occurrence. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss or damage
to the POTW, natural resources, fish kills, or any other damage to persons or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties
or other liability which may be imposed by this title or state or federal law.
18-46
(3) Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause, suffer,
or become aware of, such slug discharges are aware of the emergency
notification procedure.
(4) Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation of
this title. (2003 Code, § 13-709)
18-710. Slug control plan. Certain industrial users will be required to
develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan under 40 CFR
403.8(f)(2)(v). At least once every two (2) years, the City of Church Hill,
Tennessee, shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such
a plan. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall submit such a plan to the City of Church Hill,
Tennessee, which at a minimum addresses the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices including non-routine discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals, oil, fuel, etc;
(3) Procedures for immediate notification to the POTW of slug
discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40
CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5)
days;
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental spills,
including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading, operations, control of plant site run-off,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response. (2003 Code, § 13-710)
18-711. Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. (1) Any
user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part
261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than
seventy (70) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month; and, an estimate of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
18-47
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 18-705 of this
title. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under
the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 18-701 et seq., of this title.
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous waste, unless the waste is acute hazardous waste
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous waste in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
(90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous waste generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
(5) This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this title, a permit issued hereunder,
or any applicable federal or state law.
(6) All industries permitted by the POTW shall make a one-time
notification to the City of Church Hill, Tennessee, on the hazardous waste
notification form. Hazardous waste notification forms may be obtained through
the office of the director. (2003 Code, § 13-711)
18-712. Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(2003 Code, § 13-712)
18-713. Sample collection. (1) Except as indicated in sub-section (2)
below, the user shall collect wastewater samples using flow proportional
composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not
feasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a
18-48
minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Each grab
sample must be analyzed separately. In addition, grab samples may be required
to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2) A minimum of two (2) grab samples for oil and grease,
temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds
shall be obtained using grab collection techniques. Grab samples shall be
analyzed separately and the results of the grab samples composited.
(3) For all other pollutants, twenty-four (24) hour composite samples
must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques
where feasible. (2003 Code, § 13-713)
18-714. Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements
of this title shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this title, calibration of monitoring equipment records, and any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken
by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date,
exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking
the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses;
the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.
These records shall be retained for a period of at least three (3) years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the director. (2003 Code, § 13-714)

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
SECTION
18-801. Right of entry and inspection.
18-802. Monitoring and sampling facilities.
18-803. Search warrants.
18-801. Right of entry and inspection. (1) The director shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this title and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties required
by this title.
(2) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the director or his designee will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(3) The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property,
or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
and/or metering of the user's operations.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this title.
(6) While performing the necessary work on private properties, the city
and duly authorized employees or agents of the city shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the company and the company shall
be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees or agents and the city
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city
employees or agents against the company and growing out of other monitoring
and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure
of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(7) The city will conduct, at minimum, semi-annual wastewater
monitoring and semi-annual facility inspections of all permitted industries.
(2003 Code, § 13-801)
18-802. Monitoring and sampling facilities. (1) The installation of
a monitoring facility shall be required for all users regulated by a wastewater
18-50
discharge permit. All other users may be required to provide suitable
monitoring facilities. The purpose of the facility is to enable inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the wastewater produced by a user.
(2) Monitoring facilities shall be located on the user's premises outside
of any building unless an exception is approved by the director in writing.
(3) The director may require separate monitoring facilities to be
installed for each source of discharge of a single user.
(4) The monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable facility
approved by the director and shall be constructed and maintained at the user's
expense.
(5) If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the director,
it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense. Such sampling and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the user. There shall be ample room in or
near all monitoring facilities to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis.
(6) All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained at the
user's expense in accordance with the director's requirements and all applicable
local building codes. Construction must be completed not later than one hundred
eighty (180) days after permit approval, unless an extension is granted by the
director.
(7) All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated not less than every three (3) months to ensure accuracy. (2003 Code,
§ 13-802)
18-803. Search warrants. If the director has been refused reasonable
access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this title,
or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this title or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the appropriate court. (2003 Code, § 13-803)

18-920. Judicial review.
18-901. Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this title
are not exclusive and the director may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the director may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than
one enforcement action against any non-compliant user. (2003 Code, § 13-901)
18-902. Publication of violations. The director shall cause to be
published annually, in the largest daily newspaper serving the municipality, a
list of users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The
term significant non-compliance shall mean:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average
limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
18-52
(2) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
(3) Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
(4) Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
director's exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8) Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
If any published violation has been appealed by the user and that appeal
has not been resolved, then the published notice shall so indicate. (2003 Code,
§ 13-902)
18-903. Adoption of enforcement response plan. An enforcement
response plan, including a schedule of civil penalties which may be assessed for
certain specific violations or categories of violations, shall be established by
resolution of the board of mayor and aldermen. Any civil penalty assessed to a
violator pursuant to this section may be in addition to any other penalty
assessed by a state or federal authority. (2003 Code, § 13-903)
18-904. Notification of violation. (1) When the director finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user
a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice,
a written explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user
of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take
18-53
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
(2) Any notice or order issued pursuant to this title shall also contain
notification to the violator of his right of appeal to the wastewater appeals
board, or, the right of appeal to the Chancery Court of Hawkins County,
Tennessee. (2003 Code, § 13-904)
18-905. Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such documents shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance
within a time period specified in the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as orders issued pursuant to §§ 18-907 and 18-908 of this
title and shall be judicially enforceable. (2003 Code, § 13-905)
18-906. Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user, but shall be a prerequisite for issuing any compliance order, cease or desist
order, termination of service, or assessment of civil penalties, except as provided
by § 18-909. (2003 Code, § 13-906)
18-907. Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued upon thirty (30) days written notice, unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
18-54
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(2003 Code, § 13-907)
18-908. Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to immediately comply with all requirements and take
such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (2003 Code, § 13-908)
18-909. Emergency suspensions. (1) If the director finds that an
emergency exists imperatively requiring immediate action to protect the public
health, safety or welfare, the health of animals, fish or aquatic life, a public
water supply, or the facilities of the POTW, the director may, without prior
notice, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and requiring
that such action be taken as the director deems necessary to meet the
emergency.
(2) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection. The
director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 18-910 of this title are
initiated against the user.
(3) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under §§ 18-906 or 18-910 of this title.
(4) Nothing herein shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.
(5) Any user whose discharge is suspended pursuant to this section,
on petition to the appeal board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible,
but in no case shall such hearing be held later than three (3) working days from
the receipt of such a petition by the director. (2003 Code, § 13-909)
18-55
18-910. Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions of
§ 18-612 of this title, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in chapter 5 of this title;
or
(6) Failure to pay sewer user charges, administrative penalties,
inspection fees, or any other fee or charge authorized herein.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 18-906 of this title why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall
not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(2003 Code, § 13-910)
18-911. Method of assessment. Civil penalties shall be assessed in the
following manner:
(1) The director may issue an assessment against any person
responsible for the violation;
(2) Any person against whom an assessment has been issued may
secure a review of said assessment by filing with the director a written petition
setting forth the grounds and reasons for his objections and asking for a hearing
on the matter before the appeals board. If a petition for review of the
assessment is not filed within thirty (30) days after the date the assessment is
served, the user shall be deemed to have consented to the assessment and it
shall become final;
(3) If any assessment becomes final because of a person's failure to
appeal the director's assessment, the director may apply to the appropriate court
for a judgment and seek execution of said judgment, and the court in such
proceedings shall treat a failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of
judgment in the amount of the assessment. Upon final order, if payment is not
made the director may request the First Utility District of Hawkins County,
Tennessee, Church Hill Utility District, or any other utility district supplying
potable water terminate water service.
(4) In assessing civil penalties the director shall consider the following
factors:
(a) Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial
economic deterrent to the illegal activity;
18-56
(b) Damages to the POTW, including compensation for the
damage or destruction of the facilities of the POTW, and also including
any penalties, costs and attorney's fees incurred by the city as the result
of the activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcing this section
and the costs involved in rectifying any damages;
(c) Cause of the discharge or violation;
(d) The severity of the discharge and its effect upon the POTW
and upon the quality and quantity of the receiving waters;
(e) Effectiveness of action taken by the violator to provide a
remedy;
(f) The technical and economic reasonableness of reducing or
eliminating the discharge; and
(g) The economic benefit gained by the violator. (2003 Code,
§ 13-911)
18-912. Assessment for non-compliance with permits or orders.
(1) The director may assess any polluter or violator for damages to the
city resulting from any person's pollution or violation, failure, or neglect in
complying with any permits or orders issued pursuant to the provisions of the
pretreatment program or any part of this title.
(2) If an appeal from such assessment is not made to the appeals board
by the violator within thirty (30) days of notification of such assessment, he
shall be deemed to have consented to such assessment and it shall become final.
(3) Damages may include any expenses incurred in investigating and
enforcing the pretreatment program or §§ 18-501--18-504, in removing,
correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also compensation for any actual
damages to the POTW, or to personnel employed therein, caused by the
violation. (2003 Code, § 13-912)
18-913. Civil penalties. (1) A civil penalty up to the maximum
permitted by the Constitution and laws of the state, not to exceed ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00) per day, may be assessed against any user who has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this title or any of the following:.
(a) A wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Any valid order issued hereunder;
(c) Any pretreatment standard or requirement;
(d) Any terms or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to the
pretreatment program;
(e) Fails to complete a filing requirement of the pretreatment
program;
(f) Fails to allow entry, inspection, or monitoring; or, violates
reporting requirements;
(g) Fails to pay user or cost recovery charges imposed by the
pretreatment program; or
18-57
(h) Violates a final determination or order of the appeals board
or director.
(2) The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and
other expenses associated with enforcement, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3) In determining the amount of civil liability, account shall be taken
of all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor provided by law.
(2003 Code, § 13-913)
18-914. Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this title, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Church Hill in a
sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance. (2003 Code, § 13-914)
18-915. Financial assurance. The director may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this title, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (2003
Code, § 13-915)
18-916. Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this title, a wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
potable water service to the user provided by the First Utility District of
Hawkins County, Tennessee, Church Hill Utility District, or any other utility
district supplying potable water service may be severed. Users holding a valid
wastewater discharge permit shall be given ten (10) days written notice by
certified mail prior to the severance of said water supply. Severance of water
service for all other users shall be in conformance with the inter-local agreement
between the City of Church Hill and the First Utility District of Hawkins
County, Tennessee, Church Hill Utility District, or any other utility district
supplying potable water service. Service will only recommence, at the user's
expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply with this
title. (2003 Code, § 13-916)
18-58
18-917. Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the director may petition the appropriate court,
through the city attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
title on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user. (2003 Code, § 13-917)
18-918. Appeals to wastewater appeal board. (1) Upon receipt of a
written petition from an aggrieved user, but not less than fifteen (15) days after
notice of a matter to be appealed, the director shall give the petitioner thirty (30)
days' written notice of the time and place of the hearing, but in no case shall
such hearing be held more than sixty (60) days from the receipt of the written
petition unless the director and the petitioner agree to a postponement.
(2) An appeal to the wastewater appeal board shall be a de novo
review.
(3) Hearings or rehearings before the appeals board shall be conducted
in accordance with the following:
(a) A quorum of the appeals board shall be necessary to conduct
a hearing;
(b) A verbatim record of the proceedings shall be taken together
with the findings of fact and conclusions of law. The transcript so
recorded shall be made available to any party upon pre-payment of a
charge adequate to cover the costs of preparation;
(c) In connection with the hearing, subpoenas shall be issued in
response to any reasonable request by any party to the hearing requiring
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in the hearing. In case of contumacy or
refusal to obey a notice of hearing or subpoena issued under this section,
the Chancery Court for Hawkins County shall have jurisdiction upon
application of the appeals board or the director, to issue an order
requiring such person to appear and testify or produce evidence as the
case may require and any failure to obey such order of the court may be
punished as contempt under law;
(d) On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing, the
appeals board shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and
enter such decisions and orders as in its opinion will best further the
purposes of the pretreatment program and shall give written notice of
18-59
such decisions and orders to the petitioner. The order so issued shall be
issued no later than thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing;
(e) The decision of the appeals board shall become final and
binding on all parties unless appealed as provided in § 18-919;
(f) Any person to whom an emergency order is directed
pursuant to § 18-909 shall comply therewith immediately but on petition
to the appeals board shall be afforded a hearing not later than three (3)
working days from the receipt of such a petition by the director.
(4) The following provisions shall not be applicable to emergency
suspensions pursuant to § 18-909.
(a) If a written petition of appeal is filed by a user, the effective
date of the matter properly appealed shall be stayed until a decision is
announced by the appeals board; provided however, that in no case shall
such a stay exceed a period of ninety (90) days, except as provided in
§ 18-919, from the date of receipt of a written petition to the director to
appeal as set out hereinabove.
(b) Should a continuance of a hearing before the appeals board
be requested by a user, no additional time shall be added to the
limitations of sub-section (e) above.
(c) Should the appeals board not be able, for good cause, to hold
a hearing within the sixty (60) day limit, the stay shall be extended by
the number of days such period is exceeded.
(d) Should a continuance be requested by the city, the time of
the stay shall be extended by the same number of days as the
continuance. (2003 Code, § 13-918)
18-919. Additional stay. The appeals board may grant an additional
continuance and stay beyond that set out in the preceding section upon the
request of a user, and upon the posting of an appeal bond payable to the City of
Church Hill in a sum to be determined by the director as necessary to protect
the interests of the city. (2003 Code, § 13-919)
18-920. Judicial review. Any aggrieved party may petition for review
of any final order or judgment of the appeals board pursuant to Tennessee Code
Annotated, §§ 27-9-101 et seq. (2003 Code, § 13-920)
18-60
CHAPTER 10
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
SECTION
18-1001. Upset.
18-1002. Bypass.
18-1001. Upset. (1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, or, local pretreatment
standards for any user, because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph (3) below are met.
(3) To establish the affirmative defense of upset, a user shall
demonstrate through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
(a) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
(c) The user has submitted the following information to the
director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset.
If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days:
(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(iv) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(v) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action
brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
18-61
(vi) Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. (2003 Code,
§ 13-1001)
18-1002. Bypass. (1) For the purposes of this section,
(a) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of a waste stream
from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(b) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a
bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
(2) A user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3) (a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, he shall
submit prior notice to the director at least ten (10) days before the date
of the bypass, or as early as possible.
(b) A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within twenty-four (24) hours from the time he becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days
of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue;
and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence
of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report is received within twenty-four (24)
hours.
(4) (a) Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(i) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury or severe property damage;
(ii) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of
18-62
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(iii) The user submitted notices as required under
paragraph (3) of this section.
(b) The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this section. (2003 Code,
§ 13-1002)

18-1103. Inspection fees and tap-on fees. (1) A tap-on fee shall be
collected from each person issued a sewer connection permit to help defray the
cost of the sewer system for each user, who has not participated in an
improvement district, prior to connection to the system according to the
schedule adopted by the board of mayor and aldermen.
(2) A tap-on fee will not be permitted in lieu of participation in an
improvement district. Where a tap-on fee is paid prior to creation of an
improvement district serving the property it will be credited against the
assessment of an improvement district later created serving the property.
(3) In the event that the board of mayor and aldermen may, in its
discretion, exercise its powers to extend sewer services by means other than the
improvement district concept, and in keeping with the provisions of the
applicable ordinance pertaining to municipal public works projects, it is further
provided that the board of mayor and aldermen shall establish by ordinance a
schedule of tap-on fees including but not limited to the following categories of
use:
(a) Vacant lots or parcels;
(b) Existing residence, row houses, with existing septic tank;
(c) Additional existing units on same lot or parcel of land with
existing residence and connected to the same sewer tap;
(d) New residence, row houses;
(e) New residence located in subdivisions, planned residential
developments, and multi-family projects areas developed under the
regulations governing the subdivision of land of the city regional planning
commission in which adequate and proper sewer lines constructed by the
developer in conformity with applicable statutes of the state and
ordinances of the city pertaining to sanitation have been constructed as
part of a private subdivision development, specifically providing for an
inside municipal corporate boundary rate and an outside municipal
corporate boundary rate;
(f) Small commercial user (i.e., service stations, office building,
warehouses, etc.);
(g) Car wash for first bay and a fee for each additional bay
thereafter;
(h) Multi-family complexes existing structure for first unit and
a fee for each additional unit thereafter; and
(i) Factories and shopping centers; said fee to be based on a ten
thousand (10,000) square foot of floor space basis with a fee for each
additional ten thousand (10,000) square feet of floor space over and above
the base amount. (2003 Code, § 13-1103)
18-65
18-1104. Sewer use charges. (1) Classification of users. Users of the
wastewater system shall be classified into two (2) general classes depending
upon the users' contribution of wastewater loads; each class of user being
identified as follows:
(a) Class I: Those users whose average biochemical oxygen
demand is two hundred fifty (250) milligrams/liter concentration by
weight or less, and whose suspended solid discharge is two hundred fifty
(250) milligrams per liter concentration by weight or less.
(b) Class II: Those users whose average biochemical oxygen
demand exceeds two hundred fifty (250) milligrams/liter concentration by
weight, or whose suspended solid discharge exceeds two hundred fifty
(250) milligrams per liter concentration by weight.
(2) Determination of costs. The board of mayor and aldermen shall
establish, by resolution, monthly rates and charges for use of the wastewater
system and for all services supplied by the wastewater system. Said charges
shall be based upon administrative costs, including billing and accounting costs;
operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater collection and treatment
system; depreciation; return on investment; and debt service costs.
(a) All Class I users shall pay a single unit charge expressed as
dollars per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water purchased with the unit
charge being determined in accordance with the following formula:
TSC
Ci = Vt Where:
Ci = The Class I total unit cost in dollars per thousand gallons.
TSC= The total cost of operation, maintenance, administration
and debt service determined by yearly budget projections.
Vt = The total volume of wastewater contribution, in thousands
of gallons, from all users per year as determined from
projections from one city fiscal year to the next.
(b) All Class II users shall pay the same base unit charge per
one thousand (1,000) gallons of water purchased as Class I users (Ci) and
in addition shall pay a surcharge based on volume (Vu), a penalty
assessment (Vc), excessive amounts of biochemical oxygen demand and
suspended solids in direct proportion to the actual discharge quantities.
The following formula shall be used to compute the appropriate surcharge
(Cu):
Cu = BcBu + ScSu Where:
Cu = Total surcharge per month.
Vc = Penalty assessment for exceeding BOD or TSS.
Vu = Volume contribution (in 1000 gallons) per month.
18-66
Bc = Total cost for treatment of one pound of biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD).
Bu = Total BOD contribution above the base level from a user per
month.
Sc = Total cost for treatment of one pound of suspended solids.
Su = Total suspended solids contribution above the base level
from a user per month. (2003 Code, § 13-1104)
18-1105. Billing. (1) The billing of normal wastewater services shall
consist of monthly billing in accordance with rates established by resolution of
the board of mayor and aldermen.
(2) Any user connected to the sanitary sewer shall have water service
from some water utility system authorized to provide potable water by the State
of Tennessee, or, such user shall, at his sole expense, install a sewage flow of
sewage through such meter.
(3) Any user receiving potable water from any source shall install a
sewage flow meter as set out in subsection (2) hereinabove; or, the agency or
entity supplying potable water shall enter into an agreement with the City of
Church Hill that provides a means for verification of meter accuracy; provides
for routine and regular monthly water meter readings to be supplied to the City
of Church Hill for sewer billing purposes; and also provides for arrangements
for the termination of water service should the end user fail or refuse to pay any
valid bill for sanitary sewer service imposed by the city. (2003 Code, § 13-1105)
18-1106. User rates. (1) The base rate for each customer, user, or
beneficiary of the sewer system inside the corporate limits of the City of Church
Hill shall be thirteen dollars and twenty-six cents ($18.26) for the first two
thousand five hundred (2,500) gallons of water used. For each one thousand
gallons (1,000), or multiples thereof, used in excess of the first two thousand five
hundred (2,500) gallons, the user rate shall be three dollars and fifty-eight cents
($3.58) per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
(2) Unmetered water users with only one person in the household shall
be charged ten dollars ($10.00) per month. Unmetered water users shall be
charged thirteen dollars and twenty-six cents ($13.26) per month.
(3) In the event that the board of mayor and aldermen determine by
resolution that it is in the best interests of the city that specific property lying
outside the corporate limits of the city be furnished sewer service by the city
then the charge to the owner and/or occupant of that property for treating the
sewerage from said property shall be sixteen dollars and seventeen cents
($16.17) for the first two thousand five hundred (2,500) gallons of water used
and four dollars and forty seven cents ($4.47) for each one thousand (1,000)
gallons used thereafter.
(4) Any and all monthly user bills not paid in full by the due date
noted thereon shall have added to the outstanding balance one and one half
18-67
percent (1½%) interest which shall continue to accumulate until paid in full.
(2003 Code, § 13-1106)
18-1107. Tap fees. (1) The tap-on fee for each connection shall be one
thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars ($1,950.00). The sewer system tap-on
fee for each connection to a vacant lot or parcel shall be due and payable at the
time any building permit is issued for construction on said vacant lot or parcel.
For multi-unit dwellings, such as apartments and condominiums, which utilize
a single tap or meter, there shall be an additional tap-on charge of two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) for each individual dwelling unit up to and including six
(6) units. For all individual dwelling units in excess of six (6) on any single tap
or meter there shall be an additional tap-on of one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) for each unit. This tap-on fee schedule for additional units shall also
apply to any mobile home park or commercial shopping center within the
municipal limits which is serviced by one tap or meter. Each mobile home or
individual commercial shop or office shall be considered a separate unit for
purposes or determining the appropriate tap-on fee and monthly user fee.
(2) Developers who intend to construct residences or dwellings on
newly subdivided property or who seek the approval of subdivision plans by the
Church Hill Regional Planning Commission within the urban area designated
by the planning commission shall install all necessary sewer service lines and
laterals within the entire subdivision. Said developers shall pay a tap-on fee of
two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per tap for each single family residence in
the subdivision. Multiple family dwellings shall be charged according to the
rates set out in paragraph two (2) of this chapter. A minimum of three (3) newly
subdivided lots shall constitute a subdivision for the purposes of the application

(3) Financing shall be available to owners of residential property
located within the corporate limits of the city. A property owner(s) desiring to
finance the tap-on fee must make application therefore upon a personal financial
form provided by the city and the application must be approved by the board of
mayor and aldermen. A minimum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) down
payment shall be made prior to the execution by the property owner(s) of a
promissory note which is to be executed in the amount of the balance due and
payable to the City of Church Hill, Tennessee. The note shall be a standard
pre-printed and numbered form prescribed by the city recorder and approved by
the city attorney. The balance to be financed as evidenced by the promissory
note may be financed over a period not to exceed a two (2) year period and shall
be payable in equal monthly installments which shall bear interest at the most
favorable rate charged by The Citizens Bank of East Tennessee to its customers
on twenty-four (24) month installment loans. A late fee or penalty of an
additional one and one-half percent (1½%) of the delinquent amount,
compounded monthly, shall be charged for each month that any of the required
installment payments are delinquent, beginning on the 30th day after the
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-68
monthly payment is first due. A default by the customer or owner on the timely
payment of any monthly installment may result in the total amount of the note
with interest and penalty being accelerated and becoming due and payable
immediately. The note shall also include the requirement that the delinquent
customer pay reasonable attorneys fees incurred in the collection of the note or
in the termination and/or reconnection of sewer service to such property. The
Mayor of the City of Church Hill is hereby expressly given authority to discount
such promissory as noted above selling same to any financial institution
federally insured but not to any individual.
(4) The sewer system tap-on fee for each connection of any commercial
or industrial user whose building or structure exceeds ten thousand (10,000)
square feet of covered floor space shall be the initial one thousand nine hundred
and fifty dollars ($1,950.00) plus five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
additional ten thousand (10,000) square feet, or the appropriate pro rata
percentage of additional covered floor space.
(5) Financing shall not be available to owners of new residences
located in subdivisions in which sewer mains and laterals have been installed
by developer(s). Financing shall not be available in cases where the
development is for speculative purposes. In determining if construction is for
speculative purposes, any sewer tap-on permit issued in the name of a licensed
contractor, plumber, developer, or broker shall be considered for speculative
purposes and payment of the tap-on fee in full shall be required. In cases where
a contractor constructs a residence for personal occupancy and desires to finance
the tap-on fee, he shall (1) provide the city recorder with certification that the
residence has been constructed for personal occupancy of the owner/contractor,
and (2) present and execute a standard City of Church Hill promissory note for
sewer tap-on fees for the remaining balance payable to the City of Church Hill
at the time the down payment is made. The "Certification of Construction for
Personal Occupancy" shall be a form prescribed by the city recorder and
approved by the city attorney.
(6) Owners of property located outside the corporate limits of the city
who are given special permission by the board of mayor and aldermen to connect
to the municipal sanitary sewer system shall be required to pay the tap-on fee
in full at the time of connection.
(7) (a) The board of mayor and aldermen shall perform a
cost/benefit analysis for any proposed construction of a sewer line
extension from the municipal sewer system as it is constituted at the time
of the passage of this title. In the total discretion of the board of mayor
and aldermen, a determination will be made of the required payment
expected from the customer(s) and/or owner(s) of property who will
receive sewer service by virtue of said construction. The board may take
into consideration such factors as anticipated revenue from additional
customers, hardship situations, and available manpower, as well as other
relevant factors. In the event that the costs of said sewer extension
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-69
project exceed the base tap fee charged to the property owner or customer
under this chapter or any amendments thereto, each property owner or
customer shall be responsible for his or her pro rata share of the
additional sewer extension projects required cost reimbursement. The
costs for the particular sewer extension project shall be determined and
itemized by the city after the completion of the sewer extension project.
All costs of the sewer extension, including the expenses and legal fees
associated with the acquiring of any necessary easements and the
preparation of any required contract documents, the total cost of any
required additional pump stations, engineering costs, material and
equipment costs, labor costs, construction and/or contract costs, capital
outlay note or bond costs and expenses, all required federal, state, and
local inspection fees, and any other expense necessarily incurred by the
city in order to complete the sewer extension project shall be included in
the final computation. The property owners or customers who will receive
municipal sewer service as a result of the sewer extension project shall
each be liable for his or her pro rata share of the required cost
reimbursement over and above the base sewer system tap fee as specified
hereafter. In no event shall the tap fee charged to each property owner or
customer for a sewer extension to his/her property be less than the base
tap fee in effect at the time of the completion of the sewer extension
project. It is anticipated that the required cost reimbursement shall be
expressed in terms of percent of total project costs. Any representations
made by city officials or agents regarding estimated extension project
construction costs shall not be binding if the actual costs as itemized at
the conclusion of the project exceed the original cost estimates.
(b) Each property owner, occupant or utility water customer,
whose property or premises abuts the sewer line extension, its easement,
or the road right-of-way adjacent to the sewer extension (or easement) or
through which the sewer extension runs, must connect his/her property
or premises to the municipal sewer system within sixty (60) days of the
announcement that the sewer extension project has been completed. The
months of December, January, and February will not be included in the
calculation of the sixty (60) day connection period set out below. No
pre-completion representation made by the city or its agents regarding
any estimated sewer extension project costs shall be binding upon the city
nor shall such representations create any express or implied contracts nor
be grounds for estoppel should the actual costs of the sewer extension
project, as finally computed and itemized, exceed the initial project cost
estimates.
(c) The board of mayor and aldermen shall initiate a sewer
extension construction project by the passage of a resolution which
specifies the property to be served and sets out a projected estimate of the
cost of the project. Each property owner or customer to be served by the
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-70
extension under the terms of this chapter shall pay the base tap-fee as set
by the chapter, or any amendments thereto, within sixty (60) days of the
passage of the board's resolution if the estimated sewer extension project
costs exceed the base tap fee. The board of mayor and aldermen shall,
prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period, publish a payment
schedule for the prospective property owners and customers to be served
by the sewer extension based upon the cost estimates of the project as
determined as of the date of the publication of the schedule. The property
owners and customers who will be served by the sewer extension shall be
allowed to make voluntary periodic payments, pursuant to the schedule,
on their pro rata share of the estimated sewer extension project costs
which exceed the base tap fee, during the planning and construction
phase of the sewer extension project. The pro rata share of each property
owner or customer shall be due and payable not less than ten (10)
business days before the property is connected to the municipal sewer
system. In the event that the completed and itemized sewer extension
project costs are less than the city's initial cost estimates and any
property owner or customer has paid more than his/her finally computed
pro rata share, the respective over payments shall be returned to the
appropriate property owner with interest thereon computed by the same
method specified for hardship financing under the terms of this chapter.
(2003 Code, § 13-1107, as amended by Ord. #14-466, March 2015)
18-1108. Reconnection fees. (1) Unless done pursuant to contract
with the First Utility District "as the Church Hill Utility District," the city may
terminate sewer service to any property owner or occupant who becomes more
than thirty (30) days delinquent in the payment of monthly user fees and/or
monthly sewer financing obligations owed to the city. Prior to terminating
sewer service for any payment delinquency, the city shall give the delinquent
customer, occupant, and property owner written notice that sewer service to the
property will be terminated. Notice of termination of service shall be given by
certified mail or by personal delivery upon the delinquent customer or property
owner and shall inform the delinquent customer that his sewer service will be
terminated seven (7) days after delivery of the notice.
(2) The re-connection fee for any customer or property owner whose
sewer service has been terminated for non-payment of sewer fees, charges, or
tap-on fees under the terms of this chapter shall be the actual costs incurred by
the city to perform the reconnection. A delinquent customer whose sewer
service has been disconnected and/or reconnected shall also be liable to the city
for attorney's fees incurred by the city in enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
(3) The owner of the property connected to the municipal sewer system
shall be considered the primary customer and shall be ultimately responsible for
the payment of the tap-on fee, additional charges, and monthly user fees
regardless of whether the owner is also the occupant or tenant of the property.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-71
In the event that the owner of property is not the same individual who is the
delinquent customer, the city shall give the owner and the customer separate
notice of the termination of service for the account delinquency.
(4) Sewer tap fees, including any financing arrangements, additional
extension costs, and the anticipated reconnection charges, shall be due and
payable ten (10) business days prior to the connection of the property to the
municipal sewer. (2003 Code, § 13-1108)
18-1109. Inspection fee. The inspection fee for the completion of the
sewer connection shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) per connection. (2003 Code,
§ 13-1109)
18-1110. Application fee. The non-refundable fee to be submitted with
an application for domestic sewer service shall be ten dollars ($10.00). The
non-refundable fee to be submitted with an application for industrial sewer
service shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). (2003 Code, § 13-1110)
18-1111. Septic tank trucks annual permit fee. (1) The service
charge for annual permit for holding tank waste disposal operations shall be
established by resolution of the board of mayor and alderman as the necessity
or advisability of same may from time to time require.
(2) Persons wishing to empty septic tank trucks directly into the
wastewater treatment system must have a permit to do so and shall be charged
a minimum fee established by resolution of the board of mayor and alderman as
the necessity or advisability of same may from time to time require. (2003 Code,
§ 13-1111)
18-1112. Extra strength surcharge. Users who discharge or cause to
be discharged extra strength wastewater who possess an appropriate permit will
be subject to a surcharge to compensate for above-normal operating and
maintenance expenses incurred in treating and disposing of their discharge, not
to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the monthly sewer service charge which
would normally be assessed. (2003 Code, § 13-1112)
18-1113. Sampling and flow monitoring charges. Customers who
are required by the board to have sampling and flow monitoring devices
installed either temporarily or permanently or who choose to have flow
monitoring devices installed in order to measure actual amounts of wastewater
discharge should be charged the reasonable cost necessary to compensate for
operating and maintaining equipment and for performing analytical test on
their discharge. (2003 Code, § 13-1113)
18-1114. Hardship provisions. There is hereby established a hardship
committee whose purpose it is to review applications submitted by system
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-72
customers for the payment of fees and charges by installment payments, to
reduce the amount of fees and charges, or to waive the amount of fees and
charges altogether.
(1) The sanitation committee shall serve as the hardship committee.
(2) The hardship committee shall review applications for hardship
determination in regard to the sewer tap-on fee, monthly sewer service charge,
and reconnection charges.
(3) The application to be used in applying for a "hardship
determination" shall be developed by the city recorder and approved by the
hardship committee.
(4) The hardship committee is to make recommendations to the board
on all applications. The board will have the final approval on same.
(5) The degree or amount of charge to be reduced or waived by the
hardship committee shall be deducted from an interest bearing account created
for the purpose of the hardship committee. Once the above-referenced interest
is exhausted no additional hardship reductions or waivers may be granted in
that fiscal year.
(6) The interest bearing account referred to in subsection (5) shall be
funded by the inspection fees described in § 18-1109. Once the interest bearing
account reaches a balance of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), inspection fees
shall be deposited in the normal sewer revenue account and accrued interest
shall fund the hardship account. The above-noted funding provisions shall not
be the exclusive methods for funding the hardship account. The hardship
account may be funded in any manner acceptable under law by the board of
mayor and aldermen as noted in the city's annual budget ordinance. (2003
Code, § 13-1114)

CHAPTER 12
SYSTEM EXPANSION
SECTION
18-1201. Sewer main extension policy.
18-1202. Construction contracts.
18-1201. Sewer main extension policy. This policy covers main sizes,
subdivisions installation, extensions to subdivisions, extensions to serve
unplatted property, extensions outside the city limits, and replacement of mains.
(1) Main size. The size of any main installed in any area served by the
system shall be determined by the board of mayor and aldermen. No main less
than eight (8) inches in diameter shall be placed in the sewer collection system.
All sewer mains connected to and or served by the system shall become the
property of the city upon inspection and acceptance.
The city may participate in the cost of installing larger size mains except
in those instances where a property under single ownership shall require a main
greater than eight (8) inches.
(2) Extensions in subdivisions. No sewer shall be constructed in a
subdivision until the subdivider and the city have executed a contract covering
the extensions. This contract shall state:
(a) The estimated cost of sewer extensions.
(b) That the city shall acquire ownership on completion of the
work.
(c) That workmanship and materials must be guaranteed for a
period of one year after acceptance.
(d) That the subdivider agrees to pay the costs of inspecting the
work.
(e) That the city has examined and approved the plans and
specifications.
(f) That the city has accepted a security bond equal to the cost
of the sewer extension.
(g) Penalty provisions for noncompliance.
The subdivider shall pay the cost of construction of all sewer mains to, in,
and through his subdivision except as otherwise provided herein. Sewer mains
shall always be extended to the farthest point or points upgrade in a subdivision
so that the system, if need be, can continue uninterrupted.
(3) Construction contract or commission forces. The subdivider may
install the main in his subdivision by private contract if the city so agrees. The
subdivision must receive approval of all plans and specifications, execute the
sewer extension agreement, and allow for city inspection of actual construction.
Upon agreement, the city may allow the subdivider to deposit with it the
estimated cost of sewer construction, plus engineering and administrative cost.
Change 2, June 21, 2016 18-74
The city will then proceed to construct the sewer either under contract or by its
own forces. It at any time the actual cost exceeds the amount deposited, the
subdivider shall immediately, upon notification, deposit sufficient additional
funds to complete the work.
(4) Extension of sewer mains to serve those areas not included in
subdivisions platted after adoption of the policy. Extensions of sewer mains to
serve property already in the city, but not part of a subdivision platted after
adoption of this policy, shall be financed by special assessments against all
property benefited by such extension in accordance with § 18-1107.
(5) Sewer extensions outside the city limits. No mains shall be
extended outside the city limits, except upon the expressed consent of the board
of mayor and aldermen.
The person(s), firm, or corporation requesting such installation shall
assume the entire cost of the installation and may install the mains by private
contract upon approval of the plans and specifications by the city, execution of
the sewer main extension contract, and city inspection of actual construction.
With the consent of the city, the person(s), firm, or corporation requesting
the installation shall deposit with the city the estimated cost of installing the
main and the city may then proceed to make the actual installation with its own
forces or by private contract. In the event that the original deposit was
insufficient, the person(s), firm or corporation requesting such installation shall,
upon notification, immediately deposit with the city the balance due. The city
at its discretion may participate in the extension of the sewer line to the project
site; however, in no case shall the cost of participation exceed fifty percent
(50%). (2003 Code, § 13-1201, as amended by Ord. #14-466, March 2015)
18-1202. Construction contracts. (1) The requirements of conducting
pre-blast surveys and monitoring all blasts shall be included in all contracts for
construction concerning the wastewater treatment system.
(2) Lawn and driveway restoration. (a) All contracts for construction
concerning the wastewater treatment system shall include the
requirements that photography of existing lawns, driveways, and etc. be
taken prior to commencement of any ditching or excavation which would
materially alter said lawns, driveways, etc.
(b) Restoration is to be done so as to nearly as practical restore
the lawn and/or driveway to its original condition as soon as feasible -
weather permitting.
(3) Bonding. Sufficient performance bonds and adequate retainage is
to be required of all contractors.
(4) Paving. All contracts for the placement of sewer lines within any
paved street or right-of-way shall include the provision that such paved street
or right-of-way shall be restored -- as nearly as practical -- to its
pre-construction condition and preferably repaved after the completion of
installation of such lines.
18-75
(5) Equal opportunity. Any contract for construction work on the
wastewater treatment system shall include an "equal opportunity clause" which
is in substantial compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
and in compliance with all rules, regulations and relevant orders of the
Secretary of Labor.
(6) Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.
2000d et seq.) It shall be the policy of the board that no person shall on the
ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be
denied benefits of or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in connection with
the construction or providing services, programs, or activities in regard to the
wastewater treatment system.
(7) No handicap discrimination. Under Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), no handicapped
individual shall, solely by reason of their handicap be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any operations, programs, services, or activities rendered by the
wastewater treatment system. (2003 Code, § 13-1202)

APPENDIX A
ETHICS PROVISIONS PROVIDED BY STATUTE
1. Campaign finance.
All candidates for the chief administrative office (mayor), any candidates who
spend more than $500, and candidates for other offices that pay at least $100 a
month are required to file campaign financial disclosure reports. Civil penalties
of $25 per day are authorized for late filings. Penalties up to the greater of
$10,000 or 15 percent of the amount in controversy may be levied for filings
more than 35 days late. It is a Class E felony for a multicandidate political
campaign committee with a prior assessment record to intentionally fail to file
a required campaign financial report. Further, the treasurer of such a committee
may be personally liable for any penalty levied by the Registry of Election
Finance (T.C.A. § 2-10-101-118).
Contributions to political campaigns for municipal candidates are limited to:
a. $1,000 from any person (including corporations and other
organizations);
b. $5,000 from a multicandidate political campaign committee;
c. $20,000 from the candidate;
d. $20,000 from a political party; and
e. $75,000 from multicandidate political campaign committees.
The Registry of Election Finance may impose a maximum penalty of $10,000 or
115 percent of the amount of all contributions made or accepted in excess of
these limits, whichever is greater (T.C.A. § 2-10-301-310).
Each candidate for local public office must prepare a report of contributions that
includes the receipt date of each contribution and a political campaign
committee's statement indicating the date of each expenditure (T.C.A. §
2-10-105, 107).
Candidates are prohibited from converting leftover campaign funds to personal
use. The funds must be returned to contributors, put in the volunteer public
education trust fund, or transferred to another political campaign fund, a
political party, a charitable or civic organization, educational institution, or an
organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(c) (T.C.A. § 2-10-114).
2. Conflicts of Interest.
Municipal officers and employees are permitted to have an "indirect interest" in
contracts with their municipality if the officers or employees publicly
APP-A-2
acknowledge their interest. An indirect interest is any interest that is not
"direct," except it includes a direct interest if the officer is the only supplier of
goods or services in a municipality. A "direct interest" is any contract with the
official himself or with any business of which the official is the sole proprietor,
a partner, or owner of the largest number of outstanding shares held by any
individual or corporation. Except as noted, direct interests are absolutely
prohibited (T.C.A. § 6-2-402, T.C.A. § 6-20-205, T.C.A. § 6-54-107-108,
T.C.A. § 12-4-101-102).
3. Disclosure conflict of interests.
Conflict of interest disclosure reports by any candidate or appointee to a local
public office are required under T.C.A. §§ 8-50-501 et seq. Detailed financial
information is required, including the names of corporations or organizations in
which the official or one immediate family member has an investment of over
$10,000 or 5 percent of the total capital. This must be filed no later than 30 days
after the last day legally allowed for qualifying as a candidate. As long as an
elected official holds office, he or she must file an amended statement with the
Tennessee Ethics Commission or inform that office in writing that an amended
statement is not necessary because nothing has changed. The amended
statement must be filed no later than January 31 of each year
(T.C.A. § 8-50-504).
4. Consulting fee prohibition for elected municipal officials.
Any member or member-elect of a municipal governing body is prohibited under
T.C.A. § 2-10-124 from "knowingly" receiving any form of compensation for
"consulting services" other than compensation paid by the state, county, or
municipality. Violations are punishable as Class C felonies if the conduct
constitutes bribery under T.C.A. § 39-16-102. Other violations are prosecuted
as Class A misdemeanors. A conviction under either statute disqualifies the
offender from holding any office under the laws or Constitution of the State of
Tennessee.
"Consulting services" under T.C.A. § 2-10-122 means "services to advise or assist
a person or entity in influencing legislative or administrative action, as that
term is defined in § 3-6-301, relative to the municipality or county represented
by that official." "Consulting services" also means services to advise or assist a
person or entity in maintaining, applying for, soliciting or entering into a
contract with the municipality represented by that official. "Consulting
services" does not mean the practice or business of law in connection with
representation of clients by a licensed attorney in a contested case action,
administrative proceeding or rule making procedure;
APP-A-3
"Compensation" does not include an "honorarium" under T.C.A. § 2-10-116, or
certain gifts under T.C.A. § 3-6-305(b), which are defined and prohibited under
those statutes.
The attorney general construes "Consulting services" to include advertising or
other informational services that directly promote specific legislation or
specifically target legislators or state executive officials. Advertising aimed at
the general public that does not promote or otherwise attempt to influence
specific legislative or administrative action is not prohibited. Op. Atty.Gen. No.
05-096, June 17, 2005.
5. Bribery offenses.
a. A person who is convicted of bribery of a public servant, as defined in
T.C.A. § 39-16-102, or a public servant who is convicted of accepting a bribe
under the statute, commits a Class B felony.
b. Under T.C.A. § 39-16-103, a person convicted of bribery is disqualified
from ever holding office again in the state. Conviction while in office will not
end the person's term of office under this statute, but a person may be removed
from office pursuant to any law providing for removal or expulsion existing prior
to the conviction.
c. A public servant who requests a pecuniary benefit for performing an
act the person would have had to perform without the benefit or for a lesser fee,
may be convicted of a Class E felony for solicitation of unlawful compensation
under T.C.A. § 39-16-104.
d. A public servant convicted of "buying and selling in regard to offices"
under T.C.A. § 39-16-105, may be found guilty of a Class C felony. Offenses
under this statute relevant to public officials are selling, resigning, vacating, or
refusing to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office for pecuniary gain, or
entering into any kind of borrowing or selling for anything of value with regard
to the office.
e. Exceptions to 1, 3, and 4, above include lawful contributions to political
campaigns, and a "trivial benefit" that is "incidental to personal, professional,
or business contacts" in which there is no danger of undermining an official's
impartiality.
6. Official misconduct, official oppression, misuse of official information.
a. Public misconduct offenses under Tennessee Code Annotated §
39-16-401 through § 39-16-404 apply to officers, elected officials, employees,
APP-A-4
candidates for nomination or election to public office, and persons performing
a governmental function under claim of right even though not qualified to do so.
b. Official misconduct under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-402
pertains to acts related to a public servant's office or employment committed
with an intent to obtain a benefit or to harm another. Acts constituting an
offense include the unauthorized exercise of official power, acts exceeding one's
official power, failure to perform a duty required by law, and receiving a benefit
not authorized by law. Offenses under this section constitute a Class E felony.
c. Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-403, "Official oppression,"
a public servant acting in an official capacity who intentionally arrests, detains,
frisks, etc., or intentionally prevents another from enjoying a right or privilege
commits a Class E felony.
d. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-404 prohibits a public servant's use
of information attained in an official capacity, to attain a benefit or aid another
which has not been made public. Offenses under the section are Class B
misdemeanors.
e. A public servant convicted for any of the offenses summarized in
sections 2-4 above shall be removed from office or discharged from a position of
employment, in addition to the criminal penalties provided for each offense.
Additionally, an elected or appointed official is prohibited from holding another
appointed or elected office for ten (10) years. At-will employees convicted will
be discharged, but are not prohibited from working in public service for any
specific period. Subsequent employment is left to the discretion of the hiring
entity for those employees. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-406.
7. Ouster law.
Some Tennessee city charters include ouster provisions, but the only general law
procedure for removing elected officials from office is judicial ouster. Cities are
entitled to use their municipal charter ouster provisions, or they may proceed
under state law.
The judicial ouster procedure applies to all officers, including people holding any
municipal "office of trust or profit." (Note that it must be an "office" filled by an
"officer," distinguished from an "employee" holding a "position" that does not
have the attributes of an "office.") The statute makes any officer subject to such
removal "who shall knowingly or willfully misconduct himself in office, or who
shall knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such
officer by any of the laws of the state, or who shall in any public place be in a
state of intoxication produced by strong drink voluntarily taken, or who shall
APP-A-5
engage in any form of illegal gambling, or who shall commit any act constituting
a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude" (T.C.A. § 8-47-101).
T.C.A. § 8-47-122(b) allows the taxing of costs and attorney fees against the
complainant in an ouster suit if the complaint subsequently is withdrawn or
deemed meritless. Similarly, after a final judgment in an ouster suit,
governments may order reimbursement of attorney fees to the officer targeted
in a failed ouster attempt
(T.C.A. § 8-47-121).
The local attorney general or city attorney has a legal "duty" to investigate a
written allegation that an officer has been guilty of any of the mentioned
offenses. If he or she finds that "there is reasonable cause for such complaint, he
shall forthwith institute proceedings in the Circuit, Chancery, or Criminal Court
of the proper county." However, with respect to the city attorney, there may be
an irreconcilable conflict between that duty and the city attorney's duties to the
city, the mayor, and the rules of professional responsibility governing attorneys.
Also, an attorney general or city attorney may act on his or her own initiative
without a formal complaint (T.C.A. § 8-47-101-102). The officer must be removed
from office if found guilty (T.C.A. § 8-47-120).

APPENDIX C
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS OF THE
CHURCH HILL, TENNESSEE REGIONAL Planning Commission
(Hereafter referred to as the Planning Commission)
ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
A. Purpose.
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and
publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of
land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets
must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must
be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many
important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer,
and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed
in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the Planning Commission
are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the planning region;
to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to
secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, water,
drainage, sewer, and other sanitary facilities.
B. Authority.
These subdivision regulations are adopted under authority granted by
Sections 13-4-302 through 13-4-309 and Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411,
Tennessee Code Annotated. The Planning Commission has fulfilled the
requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such
regulations. A certified copy of the Church Hill, Tennessee Major Street and
Road Plan was filed in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Hawkins County,
Tennessee, on February 3, 1960.
C. Jurisdiction.
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate
limits of Church Hill, Tennessee, as now or hereafter established and within the
Church Hill, Tennessee Planning Region as established by resolution of the
Tennessee State Planning Office. Within these regulations the term
"subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more
lots, sites, or divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or
building development, and include resubdivision of the land or area subdivided.
APP-C-2
Any prospective subdivider owning land located within the Church Hill
Planning Region shall submit his subdivision plat to the Church Hill Regional
Planning Commission. The plat is to be submitted according to the procedures
outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements
set forth in Article III. Improvements shall be installed as required by Article
IV of these regulations.
ARTICLE II. PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL.
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of
two separate steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission of a
preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission. The
second step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of
a final plat together with required certificates. The final plat becomes the
instrument to be recorded in the office of the county register of deeds when duly
signed by the secretary of the Planning Commission.
A. General.
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the
Planning Commission wishing to divide such land into two or more lots,
sites, or divisions, for the purpose, either immediate or future, of sale or
building development, or wishing to resubdivide for this purpose, shall
submit a plan of such proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission
for approval and shall obtain such approval prior to the filing of his
subdivision plat for record. Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to
the minimum standards of design for the subdivision of land as set forth
in Article III of these regulations and shall be presented in the manner
specified in the following section of this Article. No plat of a subdivision
of land within these areas of jurisdiction shall be filed by the county
register of deeds without the approval of the Planning Commission.
2. The subdivider should consult early and informally with the
Planning Commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance
before the preparation of the preliminary plat and its formal application
for approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with
these regulations, the Major Street and Road Plan and other official plans
or public improvements which might affect the area. Such informal
review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
3. A subdivider may omit the submission of a preliminary plat,
submitting only a final plat if the following conditions are met:
APP-C-3
a. All public improvements as set forth in Article IV are
already installed. Any construction, installation, or improvements
of any public improvement shall require the submission of a
preliminary plat as prescribed by Section B of Article II.
b. The subdivider has consulted informally with the Planning
Commission technical staff for advice and assistance before the
preparation of the final plat and its formal application for
approval.
B. Preliminary Sketch Plat
1. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered, the subdivider shall submit to the secretary of the Planning
Commission twelve (12) copies of a preliminary sketch plat of the
proposed subdivision in order to allow the Planning Commission technical
staff and utilities heads time to review and prepare recommendations to
the Planning Commission. The subdivision plan shall be drawn to a scale
of not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet. At the time of
such submission the Secretary of the Planning Commission shall issue a
receipt acknowledging said submission. Neither the submission of the
preliminary sketch plat to the secretary of the Planning Commission or
the receipt issued by the secretary of the Planning Commission shall
constitute submission of the preliminary sketch plat for consideration by
the Planning Commission.
2. The sketch plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design
as set forth in Article III and the general requirements for the
construction of public improvements as set forth in Article IV shall give
the following information insofar as possible:
a. The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and
address of the owner or owners, and the name of the designer of
the plat who shall be a licensed or certified engineer or surveyor
approved by the Planning Commission.
b. Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale.
c. The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, water courses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain
pipes, water mains, and any public utility easements, the present
zoning classification, if any, both on the land to be subdivided and
on the adjoining land; and the names of adjoining property owners
or subdivisions.
APP-C-4
d. A construction plan which shall include:
(1) A complete drainage plan showing all improvements
including all proposed streets, easements, storm sewers,
swages, ditches, reserved areas and lot drainage.
(2) A plan and profile of all streets showing typical cross
sections of proposed roadways, swages and ditches as well
as both existing and proposed finished grades of paved
rights-of-way and special ditches, and details of all
structures which are part of the physical improvements in
the subdivision. All proposed drainage structures including
manholes, catch basins, junction boxes, pipe storm drainage
ditches, and other drainage facilities including head-walls
shall be shown on the plan and profile.
e. The distance and bearing of one of the corners of the
boundary of the subdivision to the nearest intersection of existing
streets or roads and to an original corner of the original survey of
which it is a part or key map showing relation of subdivision to
well-known streets, railroads, and water courses in all directions
to a distance of at least one-half mile. Suggested scale: one inch
equals 2,000 feet;
f. Plans of proposed utility layouts (sanitary and storm sewers,
water, and electricity) showing feasible connections to the existing
or any proposed utility systems. When such connections are not
practicable, any proposed individual water supply and/or sewage
disposal system, must be approved by the county health
department;
g. The names, locations, widths, and other dimensions of
proposed streets, alleys, easements, parks, and other open spaces,
reservations, lot lines, building lines and utilities;
h. Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five feet,
except when specifically not required by the Planning Commission;
i. Actual closure computations for the boundary traverses.
Such boundary traverses shall close to an accuracy of at least one
(1) part in five thousand (5,000);
3. Within sixty (60) days after submission of the preliminary sketch
plat, the Planning Commission will review it and indicate its approval,
APP-C-5
disapproval or approval subject to modification as a basis for the
preparation of the final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such
disapproval will be stated in writing. If approved subject to
modifications, the nature of the required modifications will be indicated.
4. The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission
will not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated
on the preliminary sketch plat.
5. Failure of the Planning Commission to act on the preliminary
sketch plat within sixty (60) days after being presented at a Planning
Commission meeting in accordance with subsections B-1 and B-2 of this
Article will be deemed approval of this plat, and a certificate to that effect
shall be issued by the commission on demand, provided, however, that
the applicant may waive this requirement and consent to the extension
of such period.
6. One copy of the sketch plat will be returned to the subdivider with
any notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific
changes, if any, required.
7. The approval of the preliminary sketch plat shall lapse unless a
final plat based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of
such approval unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by
the Planning Commission.
8. If the subdivision is going to be developed and submitted as final
plats in portions of the preliminary plat, the portions must be designed
and titled in alphabetical characters.
9. No subdivision shall use the name of an existing subdivision except
as noted in Article II, subsection B-8.
C. Final Plat
1. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary sketch
plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary sketch plat which he proposes
to record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion
conforms to all requirements of these regulations. If a proposed
subdivision fronts upon an existing public road, the Planning Commission
may waive the requirements for preliminary approval, and permit the
developer to submit only a final plat.
APP-C-6
2. In order to allow the Planning Commission technical staff and
utilities personnel time to review and prepare recommendations to the
Planning Commission, the final plat shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission at least fifteen (15)days prior to the meeting at which it is to
be considered. The subdivider shall submit the original drawings in black
drawing ink and twelve (12) copies (black and white prints or blue line
prints), together with street profiles or other plans that may be required
by the Planning Commission. At the time of such submission the
secretary of the Planning Commission shall issue a receipt acknowledging
said submission.
3. The final plat shall be presented to the Planning Commission at its
next meeting by the secretary or acting secretary of the Planning
Commission for consideration for approval or disapproval.
4. The plat shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals one hundred
(100) feet on sheets eighteen (18) by twenty-four (24) inches or of an
approved size to correspond to local plat book dimensions. When more
than one sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed
showing the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in alphabetical
order as a key.
5. When the final plat has been approved by the Planning
Commission, one copy will be returned to the subdivider, with the
approval of the Planning Commission certified thereon, for filing with the
county register of deeds as the official plat of record.
6. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the final
plat within sixty (60) days after its submission. Failure of the Planning
Commission to act on this final plat within these sixty (60) days shall be
deemed approval of it. If the plat is disapproved, the grounds for
disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the Planning Commission.
7. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets or
other public way or ground.
8. The final plat shall show:
a. The lines of all streets and roads, alley lines, lot lines,
building setback lines, lots numbered in numerical order,
reservations, easements, and any areas to be dedicated to public
use or sites for other than residential use with notes stating their
purpose and any limitations;
APP-C-7
b. Sufficient data to determine readily and reproduce on the
ground the location, bearing and length of every street line, lot
line, boundary line, block line and building line whether curved or
straight, and including north point. This shall include the radius,
central angle and tangent distance for the center line of curved
streets and curved property lines that are not the boundary of
curved streets.
c. All dimensions to the nearest one hundredth (100th) of a
foot and angles to the nearest minute;

right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of
the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an
existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured
from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In
no case shall the resulting right-of-way width be less than fifty (50)
feet.
APP-C-11
6. Restriction of Access
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may
be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
7. Street Grades
Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven (7) percent. Grades
on other streets may exceed seven (7) percent but shall not exceed fifteen
(15) percent.
8. Horizontal Curves

in rates of grade for major streets and one half this minimum length for
other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades
drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet
horizontal, and one inch equals ten (10) feet vertical, may be required by
the Planning Commission.
10. Intersection
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible,
and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius,
property line radii at all street intersections shall not be less than twenty
(20) feet. Where the angle of the street intersection is less than ninety
(90) degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater radius.
APP-C-12
11. Tangents
A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
12. Street Jogs
Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet shall not be allowed.
13. Dead-end Streets
a. Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end
permanently closed shall be no more than five hundred (500) feet
long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be provided at
the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway
diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of-way
diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet or the Planning
Commission may approve an alternate design such as the T or Y
background.
b. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is
desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such
property. Such dead-end streets shall be provided with a
temporary turn-around having a roadway diameter of at least
eighty (80) feet.
14. Private Streets and Reserve Strips
There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision. Every
subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street.
There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where
the control of such strips is definitely placed with the appropriate
governmental entity under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission.
15. Drainage
All streets and roads must be so designed as to provide for the
discharge of surface water from the right-of-way of all streets and roads
by grading and drainage as shall be approved by the Planning
Commission. Where it is the opinion of the Planning Commission that
APP-C-13
water cannot be adequately discharged by surface drainage, the Planning
Commission may require the installation of a storm sewer system.
16. Street Name
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others
already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing street. In
no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street
names, irrespective of the use of suffix street, avenue, boulevard,
driveway, place, or court. Through its index list of street names on file,
the Planning Commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding
duplication.
17. Alleys
Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business
purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the
subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Planning Commission of
the need for alleys.
B. Blocks
1. Length
Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) nor more than
twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except as the Planning Commission
considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of
street pattern. In blocks over eight (800) feet in length the Planning
Commission may require one or more public crosswalks of not less than
ten (10) feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at locations
deemed necessary.
2. Width
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum
depth, except where fronting on major streets or prevented by
topographical conditions or sale of the property, in which case the
Planning Commission will approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.
APP-C-14
C. Lots
1. Arrangement
Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front
for a minimum of forty (40) feet upon a public street or road which is not
less than forty (40) feet in width.
2. Minimum Size
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as the
Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and
use contemplated. Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a
connection to each lot. Where a public sewer is not accessible, an
alternate method of sewage disposal may be used, when meeting all
applicable public health regulations.
a. Residential lots served by a public sewerage system shall
not be less than sixty (60) feet wide at the building setback line nor
less than seventy-five hundred (7,500) square feet in area.
b. Residential lots not served by a public sewerage system
shall not be less than forty (40) feet wide at the street right-of-way
line and a minimum of eighty (80) feet wide at the building setback
line and shall provide a minimum area of fifteen thousand (15,000)
square feet.
Greater area may be required for private sewage disposal if,
in the opinion of the county health officer there are factors of
drainage, soil condition or other conditions to cause potential
health problems. The Planning Commission may require that data
from percolation tests be submitted as a basis for passing upon
subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage
disposal.
c. The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a
private source of water supply shall be determined by the county
health officer after investigations of soil conditions, proposed
sewerage system, and depth of ground water.
d. Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street
APP-C-15
service and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be
avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such
purposes.
e. The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the
minimum requirements of any zoning ordinance in effect.
3. Building Setback Lines and Yard Requirements
a. The minimum depth of building setback lines from the
street right-of-way line shall not be less than thirty (30) feet from
minor residential and collector streets and forty (40) feet from all
others. In case of corner lots, one must provide a setback of fifteen
(15) feet from the side street right-of-way line unless a lower
standard is allowed by the existing zoning ordinance. A minimum
side yard of eight (8) feet on one side for all lots and a total
minimum side yard setback of fifteen (15) feet is required for
interior lots.
b. In the case of electric transmission lines where easement
widths are not definitely established there shall be a minimum
building setback line from the center of the transmission line of
fifty (50) feet.
4. Corner Lots
Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the
additional side yard requirements of the zoning ordinance or building
setback lines as outlined above.
D. Public Use and Service Areas
Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located
and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as
well as public service areas.
1. Public Open Spaces
Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation area or public
access to water frontage, shown on an official map or in a plan made and
adopted by the Planning Commission, is located in part in the applicant's
subdivision, the Planning Commission may require the dedication or
reservation of such open space within the subdivision up to a total of ten
APP-C-16
(10) percent of the gross area of water frontage of the plat, for park,
school, or recreation purposes.
2. Easements for Utilities
a. Drainage and utility easements shall be provided on each
side and rear lot line where deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission. The easements shall be designed to adequately
provide utilities and drainage for all lots in the proposed
subdivision. Where drainage is proposed to cross any lot at any
point other than the side or corner of the lot, the plat shall indicate
the size of the pipe necessary to carry the proposed run-off. Each
cul-de-sac shall have provisions for a fifteen (15) foot utility
easement extending therefrom to prevent dead-end water mains.
Easements of the same or a greater width may be required along
the lines of or across lots where necessary for the extension of
existing or planned utilities.
b. Storm Sewers
Where in the opinion of the Planning Commission the flow
of water cannot be accommodated with surface drainage, storm
sewers may be required. The Planning Commission shall
determine, on the basis of the watershed and the probable run-off,
the size of the storm sewers. In ascertaining the size of the storm
sewers, the Planning Commission may call up its technical staff or
any public or private agency to assist it in its determinations.
3. Water Supply and Sewerage Connections
Where a public water supply or public sewerage system is
reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall indicate a connection with
such water supply or sewerage system and a water and sewerage
connection for each lot with such material and to such size and length as
shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Where a public water
supply or public sewerage system is not reasonably accessible or not
planned for in the future, an alternate method of water supply and
sewerage disposal may be indicated and shall be approved in writing by
the county health officer.
4. Community Assets
In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural
features such as large trees, water courses, historical sites, and similar
APP-C-17
community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value
to the property.
E. Suitability of the Land
The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land, if
from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has
been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for
platting and development purposes of the kind proposed.
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses
as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion. Such
land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered
by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
Fill may not be used to raise land in areas subject to flood unless the fill
proposed does not restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood heights.
F. Large Tracts of Parcels
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets
and logical further reusability.
G. Group Housing Developments
A comprehensive group housing development, including large scale
construction of housing units and mobile home sites together with necessary
drives and ways of access, may be approved by the Planning Commission,
although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and
subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be
made without destroying their intent.
1. Mobile Home Parks
All mobile home parks within the corporate limits shall comply
with Title 11, Chapter 5, Church Hill Municipal Code and/or these
regulations. When conflicting, the most restrictive regulation shall apply.
Proposed mobile home park developments shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for preliminary and final approval.
a. Any mobile home park development within the Church Hill
Planning Region must be submitted to the Church Hill Regional
Planning Commission for approval. A mobile home park shall
APP-C-18
mean any plot of ground upon which two or more mobile homes are
located or are intended to be located, but does not include sites
where unoccupied mobile homes are on display for sale. No mobile
home park shall contain less than two (2) acres if located outside
the corporate limits or five (5) acres if located inside the corporate
limits.
b. The owner or lessee of the land parcel proposed for a mobile
home park shall submit a plan for development to the Church Hill
Regional Planning Commission for approval. The plans shall
show:
(1) The park plan drawn to scale;
(2) The area and dimensions of the proposed park;
(3) The location and width of all roadways;
(4) The location and dimensions of any proposed service
buildings and structures;
(5) The location of all water and sewer lines;
(6) The location of all equipment and facilities for refuse
disposal and other park improvements;
(7) A plan for drainage of the park;
(8) A certificate of accuracy signed by the surveyor or
engineer that the engineering work is correct;
(9) Certificate of signature of the health officer;
(10) A certificate for Planning Commission approval; and
(11) Any other information deemed pertinent by the
Planning Commission.
c. The site shall meet the following minimum standards:
(1) The site shall be located on a well drained and flood
free site with proper drainage.
APP-C-19
(2) The site shall not be exposed to objectionable smoke,
noise, odors, insect or rodent harborage or other adverse
influences.
(3) The site shall be located with direct access to an open
public street.
(4) There shall be buffer strips along side and rear lot
lines of the park. Buffer strip shall mean a plant material
which will provide a screen not less than six feet in height.
(5) The mobile home park shall have a maximum density
of 10 mobile home units per gross acre. All mobile home
units shall abut on a driveway with unobstructed access to
an open approved public street. Each mobile home shall be
set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from property lines, and
there shall be a minimum distance of 20 feet between
mobile homes.
(6) Each mobile home space shall be provided with a 200
square foot vehicular parking area.
(7) No service building shall be located less than 20 feet
from any mobile home space. Service buildings shall be of
permanent construction, adequately ventilated and lighted
and built in conformity to all city codes and ordinances.
(8) Municipal water supply or an alternate source and
sanitary sewer facilities approved by the county health
officer shall be provided to each mobile home space.
(9) Each mobile home park shall provide a common area
for playgrounds, and leisure time pursuits totaling a
minimum of 500 square feet for each mobile home space
exclusive of roadways, mobile home spaces, and parking
spaces.
(10) All service buildings shall be convenient to the spaces
which they solely serve and shall be maintained in a clean
and sanitary condition.
(11) The drives, walks, and parking areas shall be paved
with a hard surface material which shall be not less than a
double bituminous surface.
APP-C-20
(12) Driveways shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.
(13) Any part of the park area not used for buildings or
other structures, parking, or access ways shall be
landscaped with grass, trees, shrubs, and pedestrian walks.
(14) The park shall be adequately lighted.
2. Planned Unit Developments
Planned unit subdivisions may be approved by the Planning
Commission provided they are connected to a publicly approved sewerage
system and conform to the overall intent of these regulations.
H. Mobile Home Subdivisions
The Planning Commission may approve a subdivision with lots designed
and established exclusively for mobile homes. A mobile home is a detached
single family dwelling unit with the following characteristics: (a) designed for
long-term occupancy and containing sleeping accommodations, a flush toilet, a
tub or shower bath, and kitchen facilities with plumbing and electrical
connections provided for attachment to outside systems; (b) designed to be
transported after fabrication on its own wheels, or on a flat-bed or other trailers
or detachable wheels; and © arriving at the site where it is to be occupied as a
dwelling complete, including major appliances and furniture, and ready for
occupancy except for minor and incidental unpacking and assembly operations,
location on foundation supports, connection to utilities and the like. Mobile
home subdivisions shall meet the following standards.
1. The minimum lot sizes, setbacks, and yard requirements shall be
the same as those established in this Article.
I. Variances
Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
1. Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to these
regulations would cause unnecessary hardship; or
2. Where the Planning Commission decides that there are
topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, and a departure
from these regulations will not destroy their intent. Any variance thus
authorized and the reasons therefore shall be stated in writing in the
minutes of the Planning Commission.
APP-C-21
J. Zoning or Other Regulations
No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning
ordinance will be approved unless it conforms with such ordinance.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or
dimensions noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building
code, or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.
Article IV. Development Prerequisite to Final Approval
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a
prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw
acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation.
Improvements by the subdivider spare the community from a potential tax
liability. The following tangible improvements are required before final plat
approval in order to assure the physical reality of a subdivision which approval
and recordation will establish legally.
A. Required Improvements
Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve
streets and alleys, and to install curbs, monuments, sewers, storm water inlets
and water mains, in accordance with specifications established by the Church
Hill Regional Planning Commission. Where specifications adopted by local
authorities conflict with standards as set forth in these subdivision regulations,
the higher set of standards, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall
govern.
1. Monuments
a. Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or square,
three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners,
at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior
boundaries of the subdivision, and at angle points and points of
curve in each street. The top of the monuments shall have an
indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set
flush with the finished grade.
b. All other corners and points shall be marked with iron pipe
or solid steel rod not less than one-half (½) inches in diameter and
twenty-four (24) inches long and driven so as to be flush with the
finished grade.
APP-C-22
2. Grading
All street, roads and alleys shall be graded or filled horizontally to
the full width of their rights-of-way by the subdivider or developer. Due
to special topographical conditions, deviation from the above will be
allowed only with special approval of the Planning Commission.
a. Preparation. Before grading is started the entire
right-of-way area shall be cleared of all trees, stumps, roots, brush
and other objectionable materials.
b. Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall
be removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock,
when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of twelve (12)
inches below subgrade.
c. Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used
in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places needed.
Excess materials including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall
be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in
layers not to exceed six (6) inches loose and compacted by a sheep's
foot roller. Unless another method of preparation of the subgrade
is approved by Planning Commission, the subgrade shall be
constructed as specified in Section 203 Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of
Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and latest revision
thereto. The filling of utility trenches and other places not
accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped, and where
water is used to assist compaction the water content shall not
exceed the optimum of moisture.
3. Storm Drainage
An adequate drainage system, including storm sewers, necessary
open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges,
etc., shall be provided for proper drainage of all surface water. Cross
drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall
be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required
slopes. The size openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbot's
formula and in no case shall the pipe be less than twelve (12) inches.
Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade and shall be laid on
a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with spigot end pointing
in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to
provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at
APP-C-23
a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of
impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than one foot below
the roadbed.
4. Roadway Improvements
a. Base: A compacted base course six (6) inches deep and three
(3) feet wider than the width of the pavement on each side of the
street shall be installed on all streets, including cul-de-sacs,
temporary turn arounds and access streets to adjoining properties,
according to the method specified in Section 33, Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee
Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and
latest revisions thereto. Wetting of the stone before compaction
may be done at a point of origin or on the job site at the option of
the contractor. In all cases the center line of a roadway shall
coincide with the center line of the right-of-way dedicated for such
road or street. A compaction test shall be performed at the
expense of the developer by a certified laboratory to verify that all
such streets comply with all appropriate standards. (Amended by
Ordinance No. 255, October 19, 1993).
b. Curbs: Except for rural streets as defined above, the
subdivider shall install curbs of no lower classification than
machine formed concrete extruded curb, nine (9) inches wide at the
base and seven and one-half (7 ½) inches high. The curb shall be
installed after the prime coat is applied to the base. Back fill shall
be towards the curb to insure drainage of surface water into the
drainage system.
In lieu of curbs as the drainage system on cul- de-sacs and
loop streets in the planning region, the Planning Commission may
accept one of two alternatives:
(1) swages may be used on streets where the finished
grade does not exceed two (2) percent; or
(2) street with an inverted crown may be used provided
that the drainage area of the street does not exceed five (5)
acres.
One-half (½) inch to three-fourths (3/4) inch expansion and
contraction joints for the curbs shall be placed at intervals not
exceeding forty (40) feet.
APP-C-24
c. Prime Coat: After a thoroughly compacted base has been
established, a prime coat shall be applied as specified in Section
402, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
Tennessee Department of Highway and Public Works - January 1,
1968, and latest revision thereto. In no event is the prime coat or
binder to be less than two inches (2") deep. (Amended by
Ordinance No. 255, October 19, 1993).
d. Wearing Surface: The wearing surface shall consist of
surface course constructed with asphalt concrete, prepared with
mineral aggregate, laid hot as specified under Section 411,
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works - January
1, 1968, and latest revisions thereto. It shall be constructed in one
layer not less than one (1) inch thick to conform to the lines, grades
and cross sections indicated on a plan approved by the inspecting
engineer. (Amended by Ordinance No. 255, 10/19/1993).
5. Minimum Pavement Width
Due to the diversity of development in the Church Hill Planning
Region ranging from sparsely populated agricultural areas to the densely
populated urban areas, required widths for the surface treatment of
roadways (by the developer) will necessarily vary with the character of
building development and the amount of traffic encountered. Minimum
widths for surface treatment of roads and streets shall be those indicated
below.
a. Arterial Streets . . . . . . . (not usually paved by developer)
b. Collector Streets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 feet
c. Minor Residential . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 feet
Most minor streets in residential developments involve parking
and/or considerable traffic. (Amended by Ordinance No. 255,
October 19, 1993)
d. Marginal Access . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 feet
Maximum length 1200 feet or 25 dwelling units.
e. Loop Streets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 feet
Maximum length 1000 feet or 25 dwelling units.

APP-C-25
Maximum length 500 feet or 15 dwelling units.
g. Rural Streets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 to 20 feet
Without curbs - minimum of one-acre lots and 150 feet frontage.
6. Installation of Utilities
After grading is completed and approved and before any base is
applied, all of the underground work - water mains, gas mains, etc., and
all service connections shall be installed completely and approved
throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All
driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and
drained.
7. Water Supply System
Water mains properly connected with the community water supply
approved by the county health officer shall be constructed in such a
manner as to adequately serve all lots shown on the subdivision plat for
both domestic use and fire protection. Fire hydrants are required to be
installed when 6" water lines are available.
The size of water mains, the location and type of valves and
hydrants, the amount of soil cover the pipes and other features of the
installation shall be approved by the Planning Commission upon the
recommendation of the Superintendent of Water and Light Commission
or other applicable inspection agencies, and shall conform with accepted
standards of good practice for municipal water systems.
8. Sanitary Sewers
a. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a
sewerage system, they must contain adequate area for the
installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields and must
be approved in writing by the county health officer.
b. All lots connected to a sewer system shall be approved by
the utility operating the system. They shall meet all requirements
of the state health department and shall be approved by the
Hawkins County Health Department.
c. Subdividers shall supply all data required for the
installation and/or operation of the sewerage system to the
APP-C-26
appropriate utility district, Hawkins County Health Department,
and the Tennessee State Department of Health.
9. Erosion Control
The Planning Commission, shall require seeding or other
conservation measures of all areas subject to erosion.
10. Street Name Signs
Appropriate street signs also add sales value to land subdivisions
and enable strangers, delivery concerns and even potential lot buyers to
find their way around. Street name signs, stop signs, and other traffic
control signs as designated by the Planning Commission will aid the
subdivider with specifications for the construction, placing, and setting
of such signs.
B. Guarantee in Lieu of Completed Improvements
No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission
or accepted for record by the County Register of Deeds until one of the following
conditions has been met:
1. All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory
manner and approved by the City of Church Hill, Tennessee.
2. The Planning Commission has accepted a security or performance
bond in an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of the
required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and
utilities installed without cost to the city in the event of default of the
subdivider. The conditions of such security or performance bond shall
provide for the installation of the improvements covered by such bond
within a period of not to exceed one (1) year; provided, however that such
period may be extended by the Planning Commission with the consent of
the parties thereto if the Planning Commission finds that the public
interest will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the Planning
Commission shall decide at any time during the performance bond that
the extent of the building development that has taken place in the
subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by
such performance bond, that required improvements have been installed
as provided in this Section in sufficient amount to warrant reduction in
the face amount of said bond, or that the character and the extent of such
development require additional improvements for any or all such
improvements, the face value of such performance bond shall thereupon
APP-C-27
be reduced or increased by an appropriate amount so that the new face
amount will cover the cost in full of the amended list of improvements.
Performance bonds which are submitted in lieu of the installation
of required improvements shall be in cash or made by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Tennessee. In the case of a
surety company, the performance bond shall be prepared according to the
form as shown in Attachment A, said Attachment A is made a part of
these subdivision regulations.
Article V. Enforcement and Penalties for Violations
The enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the unapproved
recitation or transfer of land is provided by state law in the authority granted
by public acts of the State of Tennessee.
A. Enforcement
1. No plat or plan of a subdivision of land into two or more lots
located within the Church Hill Planning Region shall be admitted to the
land records of the county or received or recorded by the County Register
of Deeds until said plat or plan has received final approval in writing by
the Planning Commission as provided in Title 13, Tennessee Code
Annotated.
B. Penalties
1. No county register shall receive, file, or record a plat of a
subdivision within the planning region without the approval of the
Planning Commission as required in Section 13-3-402, Tennessee Code
Annotated, and any county register so doing shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law.
2. Sections 13-4-307 and 13-3-406, Tennessee Code Annotated,
provides that "Whoever being the owner or agent of the owner of any
land, transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by
reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such
land without having submitted a plat of such subdivision to the Planning
Commission and obtained its approval as required by this Act and before
such plat be recorded in the office of the county register, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided
by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of
transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring
shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties." In this case of the
APP-C-28
regional Planning Commission, Section 13-3-410 provides that the county
through its county attorney, or other official designated by the county
commission may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action of
injunction.

subdivision regulations shall be deemed an unlawful building or
structure, and the building commissioner or the solicitor of the
municipality or other official designated by the chief legislative body
and/or the county attorney or other official designated by the county
commission may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be
vacated or removed as provided in Section 13-3-411, Tennessee Code
Annotated.

SUBDIVISION INSPECTION PROCEDURES
In order to insure the proper development of subdivisions within the
Church Hill Planning Region, a subdivision inspection system has been
established. The Planning Commission has appointed a committee to inspect
the progress of all developing subdivisions within its jurisdiction. The
committee will inspect each developing subdivision three (3) times.
1. There will be an inspection immediately following clearance of the
right-of-way;
2. Immediately following the laying and compacting of the 6" stone
base; and
3. Before final approval is requested in order to insure that curbing,
paving, backfilling, seeding, etc., have been accomplished.
The developer of a subdivision will be responsible for notifying the
committee during each of the above mentioned steps. The committee will
make its inspection promptly to insure a minimum of delay of the
developer.
Inspection committee contacts are listed below. Failure to notify
the committee of completion of each step mentioned above could delay
final approval of a subdivision.
