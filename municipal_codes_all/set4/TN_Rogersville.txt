PREFACE
The Rogersville Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of
the ordinances of the Town of Rogersville, Tennessee. By referring to the
historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine
the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the town's ordinance book or the town recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the town's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the town's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the town is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the town agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in
the MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
iv
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team: Hannah Kraemer, Program
Resource Specialist; and Linda Winstead, Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown,
Administrative Specialists, is gratefully acknowledged.

4-313. Definitions.
4-301. Purpose. The Town of Rogersville recognizes that the use and
abuse of drugs and alcohol in today's society is a serious problem that may
involve the workplace. It is the intent of the Town of Rogersville to provide all
employees with a safe and secure workplace in which each person can perform
his/her duties in an environment that promotes individual health and workplace
efficiency. Employees of the Town of Rogersville are public employees and must
foster the public trust by preserving employee reputation for integrity, honesty,
and responsibility.
To provide a safe, healthy, productive, and drug-free working
environment for its employees to properly conduct the public business, the Town
of Rogersville has adopted this drug and alcohol testing policy effective
_________, 199__. This policy complies with the: Drug-Free Workplace Act of
1988, which ensures employees the right to work in an alcohol-and drug-free
environment and to work with persons free from the effects of alcohol and drugs;
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rules, which require drug and alcohol
testing for persons required to have a commercial driver's license (CDL);
Division of Transportation (DOT) rules, which include procedures for urine drug
testing and breath alcohol testing; and the Omnibus Transportation Employee
Testing Act of 1991, which requires alcohol and drug testing of safety-sensitive
employees in the aviation, motor carrier, railroad, pipeline, commercial marine,
and mass transit industries. In the case of this policy, the Omnibus
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 is most significant with its
additional requirement of using the "split specimen" approach to drug testing,
which provides an extra safeguard for employees. The types of tests required
4-6
are: pre-employment, transfer, reasonable suspicion, post-accident (postincident),
random, return-to-duty, and follow-up.
It is the policy of the Town of Rogersville that the use of drugs by its
employees and impairment in the workplace due to drugs and/or alcohol are
prohibited and will not be tolerated. Engaging in prohibited and/or illegal
conduct may lead to termination of employment. Prohibited and/or illegal
conduct includes but is not limited to:
(1) Being on duty or performing work in or on town property while
under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol;
(2) Engaging in the manufacture, sale, distribution, use, or
unauthorized possession of (illegal) drugs at any time and of alcohol while on
duty or while in or on town property;
(3) Refusing or failing a drug and/or alcohol test administered under
this policy;
(4) Providing an adulterated, altered, or substituted specimen for
testing;
(5) Use of alcohol within four (4) hours prior to reporting for duty on
schedule or use of alcohol while on-call for duty; and
(6) Use of alcohol or drugs within eight (8) hours following an accident
(incident) if the employee's involvement has not been discounted as a
contributing factor in the accident (incident) or until the employee has
successfully completed drug and/or alcohol testing procedures.
This policy does not preclude the appropriate use of legally prescribed
medication that does not adversely affect the mental, physical, or emotional
ability of the employee to safely and efficiently perform his/her duties. It is the
employee's responsibility to inform the proper supervisory personnel of his/her
use of such legally prescribed medication before the employee goes on duty or
performs any work.
In order to educate the employees about the dangers of drug and/or
alcohol abuse, the town shall sponsor an information and education program for
all employees and supervisors. Information will be provided on the signs and
symptoms of drug and/or alcohol abuse; the effects of drug and/or alcohol abuse
on an individual's health, work, and personal life; the town's policy regarding
drugs and/or alcohol; and the availability of counseling. The personnel director
has been designated as the municipal official responsible for answering
questions regarding this policy and its implementation.
All Town of Rogersville property may be subject to inspection at any time
without notice. There should be no expectation of privacy in such property.
Property includes, but is not limited to, vehicles, desks, containers, files, and
lockers. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-302. Scope. Certain aspects of this policy may apply to full-time, parttime,
temporary, and volunteer employees of the Town of Rogersville. The policy
also applies to applicants for positions requiring a CDL and other safety
4-7
sensitive positions who have been given a conditional offer of employment from
the Town of Rogersville. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-303. Consent form. Before a drug and/or alcohol test is administered,
employees and applicants will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the
test and permitting release of test results to the laboratory, medical review
officer (MRO), personnel director or his/her designee. The consent form shall
provide space for employees and applicants to acknowledge that they have been
notified of the town's drug and alcohol testing policy.
The consent form shall set forth the following information:
(1) The procedure for confirming and verifying an initial positive test
result;
(2) The consequences of a verified positive test result; and
(3) The consequences of refusing to undergo a drug and/or alcohol test.
The consent form also provides authorization for certified or licensed
attending medical personnel to take and have analyzed appropriate specimens
to determine if drugs or alcohol were present in the employee's system. (Ord.
#1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-304. Compliance with substance abuse policy. Compliance with
this substance abuse policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal
by an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by signing necessary consent
forms or other required documents or the failure or refusal to submit to any test
or any procedure under this policy in a timely manner will be grounds for
refusal to hire or for termination. The submission by an applicant or employee
of a urine sample that is not his/her own or is adulterated shall be grounds for
refusal to hire or for termination. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-305. General rules. These are the general rules governing the Town
of Rogersville drug and alcohol testing program:
(1) Town employees shall not take or be under the influence of any
drugs unless prescribed by the employee's licensed physician. Employees who
are required to take prescription and/or over-the-counter medications shall
notify the proper supervisory personnel before the employees go on duty.
(2) Town employees are prohibited from engaging in the manufacture,
sale, distribution, use, or unauthorized possession of illegal drugs at any time
and of alcohol while on duty or while in or on town property.
(3) All Town of Rogersville property is subject to inspection at any time
without notice. There should be no expectation of privacy in or on such
property. Town property includes, but is not limited to, vehicles, desks,
containers, files, and lockers.
(4) Any employee convicted of violating a criminal drug statute shall
inform the director of his/her department of such conviction (including pleas of
guilty and nolo contendere) within five (5) days of the conviction occurring.
4-8
Failure to so inform the town subjects the employee to disciplinary action up to
and including termination for the first offense. The town will notify the federal
contracting officer pursuant to applicable provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace
Act and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act. (Ord. #1-9-96-1,
Jan. 1996)
4-306. Drug testing. An applicant or employee must carry and present
a current and recent photo ID to appropriate personnel during testing. Failure
to present a photo ID is equivalent to refusing to take the test. Employees and
applicants may be required to submit to drug testing under six (6) separate
conditions:
(1) Types of tests. (a) Pre-employment. All applicants for employee
status for positions requiring a CDL (or for a position in the fire
department, police department, gas department, and transit department),
who have received a conditional offer of employment with the Town of
Rogersville, must take a drug test before receiving a final offer of
employment. (Note: It is not a requirement to conduct pre-employment
test for all applicants in the fire department, police department, gas
department or transit department and your city or town may want to
delete this requirement.)
(b) Transfer. Employees transferring to the fire department,
police department, gas department and transit department and/or
another position within the town that requires a commercial driver's
license (CDL) shall undergo drug testing.
(c) Post-accident/post-incident testing. Following any
workplace accident (incident) determined by supervisory personnel of the
Town of Rogersville to have resulted in significant property or
environmental damage or in significant personal injury, including but not
limited to a fatality or human injury requiring medical treatment, each
employee whose performance either contributed to the accident (incident)
or cannot be discounted as a contributing factor to the accident (incident)
and who is reasonably suspected of possible drug use as determined
during a routine post-accident (post-incident) investigation or who
receives a citation for a moving violation arising from the accident will be
required to take a post-accident (post-incident) drug test.
Post-accident (post-incident) testing shall be carried out within
thirty-two (32) hours following the accident (incident). Urine collection
for post-accident (post-incident) testing shall be monitored or observed by
the same-gender collection personnel at the established collection site(s).
In instances where post-accident (post-incident) testing is to be
performed, the Town of Rogersville reserves the right to direct the
medical review officer (MRO) to instruct the designated laboratory to
perform testing on submitted urine specimens for possible
illegal/illegitimate substances.
4-9
Any testing for additional substances listed under the Tennessee
Drug Control Act of 1989 as amended shall be performed at the urinary
cutoff level that is normally used for those specific substances by the
laboratory selected.
(i) Post-accident (post-incident) testing for ambulatory
employees. Following all workplace accidents (incidents) where
drug testing is to be performed, unless otherwise specified by the
department head, affected employees who are ambulatory will be
taken by a supervisor or designated personnel of the Town of
Rogersville to the designated urine specimen collection site within
thirty-two (32) hours following the accident. (Note: DOT
regulations allow up to 32 hours for drug tests. A lesser time
provision is optional.) In the event of an accident (incident)
occurring after regular work hours, the employee(s) will be taken
to the testing site within thirty-two (32) hours. No employee shall
consume drugs prior to completing the post-accident (post-incident)
testing procedures.
No employee shall delay his/her appearance at the
designated collection site(s) for post-accident (post-incident)
testing. Any unreasonable delay in providing specimens for drug
testing shall be considered a refusal to cooperate with the
substance abuse program of the Town of Rogersville and shall
result in administrative action up to and including termination of
employment.
(ii) Post-accident (post-incident) testing for injured
employees. An affected employee who is seriously injured, nonambulatory,
and/or under professional medical care following a
significant accident (incident) shall consent to the obtaining of
specimens for drug testing by qualified, licensed attending medical
personnel and consent to the testing of the specimens. Consent
shall also be given for the attending medical personnel and/or
medical facility (including hospitals) to release to the medical
review officer (MRO) of the Town of Rogersville appropriate and
necessary information or records that would indicate only whether
or not specified prohibited drugs (and what amounts) were found
in the employee's system. Consent shall be granted by each
employee at the implementation date of the substance abuse policy
of the Town of Rogersville or upon hiring following the
implementation date.
Post-accident (post-incident) urinary testing may be
impossible for unconscious, seriously injured, or hospitalized
employees. If this is the case, certified or licensed attending
medical personnel shall take and have analyzed appropriate
specimens to determine if drugs were present in the employee's
4-10
system. Only an accepted method for collecting specimens will be
used. Any failure to do post-accident (post-incident) testing within
32 hours must be fully documented by the attending medical
personnel.
(d) Testing based on reasonable suspicion. A drug test is
required for each employee where there is reasonable suspicion to believe
the employee is using or is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
The decision to test for reasonable suspicion must be based on a
reasonable and articulate belief that the employee is using or has used
drugs. This belief should be based on recent, physical, behavioral, or
performance indicators of possible drug use. One supervisor who has
received drug detection training that complies with DOT regulations
must make the decision to test and must observe the employee's
suspicious behavior.
Supervisory personnel of the Town of Rogersville making a
determination to subject any employees to drug-testing based on
reasonable suspicion shall document their specific reasons and
observations in writing to the personnel director within 24 hours of the
decision to test and before the results of the urine drug tests are received
by the department. Urine collection for reasonable suspicion testing shall
be monitored or observed by same-gender collection personnel.
(e) Random testing. Only employees of the Town of Rogersville
possessing or wishing to obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL) are
subject to random urine drug testing. (Note: It is not a requirement to
randomly test police or fire department employees and town may wish to
delete this provision.) It is the policy of the Town of Rogersville to
annually random test for drugs at least fifty (50) percent of the total
number of drivers possessing or obtaining a commercial driver's license
(CDL).
A minimum of fifteen (15) minutes and a maximum of two (2)
hours will be allowed between notification of an employee's selection for
random drug testing and the actual presentation for specimen collection.
Random donor selection dates will be unannounced with
unpredictable frequency. Some may be tested more than once each year
while others may not be tested at all, depending on the random selection.
If an employee is unavailable (i.e. vacation, sick day, out of town,
work-related causes, etc.) to produce a specimen on the date random
testing occurs, the Town of Rogersville may omit that employee from that
random testing or await the employee's return to work.
(f) Return to duty and follow-up. Any employee of the Town of
Rogersville who has violated the prohibited drug conduct standards and
is allowed to return to work, must submit to a return-to-duty test.
Follow-up tests will be unannounced, and at least six tests will be
conducted in the first twelve (12) months after an employee returns to
4-11
Appendices for the Rogersville Drug Testing Policy are of record in the 1
recorder's office.
Appendices for the Rogersville Drug Testing Policy are of record in the 2
recorder's office.
duty. Follow-up testing may be extended for up to sixty (60) months
following return to duty.
The employee will be required to pay for his or her return-to-duty
and follow-up tests accordingly. (Note: Requiring employees to pay for
their return-to-duty and follow-up tests is optional. Return-to-duty and
follow-up tests are not required for non-CDL drivers.)
Testing will also be performed on any employee possessing a CDL
returning from leave or special assignment in excess of six (6) months.
In this situation, the employee will not be required to pay for the testing.
(2) Prohibited drugs. All drug results will be reported to the medical
review officer (MRO). If verified by the MRO, they will be reported to the
personnel director. The following is a list of drugs for which tests will be
routinely conducted. (See Appendix A for cutoff levels): 1
(a) Amphetamines;
(b) Marijuana;
(c) Cocaine;
(d) Opiates;
(e) Phencyclidine (PCP);
(f) Alcohol; and
(g) Depressants.
The town may test for any additional substances listed under the Tennessee
Drug Control Act of 1989.
(3) Drug testing collection procedures. Testing will be accomplished
as non-intrusively as possible. Affected employees, except in cases of random
testing, will be taken by a supervisor or designated personnel of the Town of
Rogersville to a drug test collection facility selected by the Town of Rogersville
(see Appendix B), where a urine sample will be taken from the employee in
privacy. The urine sample will be immediately sealed by personnel overseeing
the specimen collection after first being examined by these personnel for signs
of alteration, adulteration, or substitution. The sample will be placed in a
secure mailing container. The employee will be asked to complete a chain-ofcustody
form to accompany the sample to a laboratory selected by the Town of
Rogersville to perform the analysis on collected urine samples.
(4) Drug testing laboratory standards and procedures. All collected
urine samples will be sent to a laboratory that is certified and monitored by the
federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (see Appendix C).2
As specified earlier, in the event of an accident (incident) occurring after
regular work hours, the supervisor or designated personnel shall take the
4-12
Appendices for the Rogersville Drug Testing Policy are of record in the 1
recorder's office.
employee(s) to the testing site within thirty-two (32) hours where proper
collection procedures will be administered.
The Omnibus Act requires that drug testing procedures include split
specimen procedures. Each urine specimen is subdivided into two (2) bottles
labeled as a "primary" and a "split" specimen. Both bottles are sent to a
laboratory. Only the primary specimen is opened and used for the urinalysis.
The split specimen bottle remains sealed and is stored at the laboratory. If the
analysis of the primary specimen confirms the presence of drugs, the employee
has seventy-two (72) hours to request sending the split specimen to another
federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) certified laboratory
for analysis. The employee will be required to pay for his or her split specimen
test(s).
For the employee's protection, the results of the analysis will be
confidential except for the testing laboratory. After the MRO has evaluated a
positive test result, the employee will be notified, and the MRO will notify the
personnel director.
(5) Reporting and reviewing. The Town of Rogersville shall designate
a medical review officer (MRO) to receive, report, and file testing information
transmitted by the laboratory. This person shall be a licensed physician with
knowledge of substance abuse disorders (see Appendix C).1
(a) The laboratory shall report test results only to the
designated MRO, who will review them in accordance with accepted
guidelines and the procedures adopted by the Town of Rogersville.
(b) Reports from the laboratory to the MRO shall be in writing
or by fax. The MRO may talk with the employee by telephone upon
exchange of acceptable identification.
(c) The testing laboratory, collection site personnel, and MRO
shall maintain security over all the testing data and limit access to such
information to the following: the respective department head, the
personnel director, and the employee.
(d) Neither the Town of Rogersville, the laboratory, nor the
MRO shall disclose any drug test results to any other person except under
written authorization from the affected employee, unless such results are
necessary in the process of resolution of accident (incident) investigations,
requested by court order, or required to be released to parties (i.e., DOT,
the Tennessee Department of Labor, etc.) having legitimate right-to-know
as determined by the city attorney. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-307. Alcohol testing. An applicant or employee must carry and
present a current and recent photo ID to appropriate personnel during testing.
4-13
Failure to present a photo ID is equivalent to refusing to take the test.
Employees and applicants may be required to submit to alcohol testing under
six (6) separate conditions:
(1) Types of tests. (a) Post-accident/post-incident testing. Following
any workplace accident (incident) determined by supervisory personnel
of the Town of Rogersville to have resulted in significant property or
environmental damage or in significant personal injury, including but not
limited to a fatality or human injury requiring medical treatment, each
employee whose performance either contributed to the accident (incident)
or cannot be discounted as a contributing factor to the accident (incident)
and who is reasonably suspected of possible alcohol use as determined
during a routine post-accident (post-incident) investigation or who
receives a citation for a moving violation arising from the accident will be
required to take a post-accident (post-incident) alcohol test.
Post-accident (post-incident) testing shall be carried out with two
(2) hours following the accident (incident).
(i) Post-accident (post-incident) testing for ambulatory
employees. Following all workplace accidents (incidents) where
alcohol testing is to be performed, unless otherwise specified by the
department head, affected employees who are ambulatory will be
taken by a supervisor or designated personnel of the Town of
Rogersville to the designated breath alcohol test site for a breath
alcohol test within two (2) hours following the accident. In the
event of an accident (incident) occurring after regular work hours,
the employee(s) will be taken to the testing site within two (2)
hours. No employee shall consume alcohol prior to completing the
post-accident (post-incident) testing procedures.
No employee shall delay his/her appearance at the
designated collection site(s) for post-accident (post-incident)
testing. Any unreasonable delay in appearing for alcohol testing
shall be considered a refusal to cooperate with the substance abuse
program of the Town of Rogersville and shall result in
administrative action up to and including termination of
employment.
(ii) Post-accident (post-incident) testing for injured
employees. An affected employee who is seriously injured, nonambulatory,
and/or under professional medical care following a
significant accident (incident) shall consent to the obtaining of
specimens for alcohol testing by qualified, licensed attending
medical personnel and consent to specimen testing. Consent shall
also be given for the attending medical personnel and/or medical
facility (including hospitals) to release to the medical review officer
(MRO) of the Town of Rogersville appropriate and necessary
information or records that would indicate only whether or not
4-14
specified prohibited alcohol (and what amount) was found in the
employee's system. Consent shall be granted by each employee at
the implementation date of the substance abuse policy of the Town
of Rogersville or upon hiring following the implementation date.
Post-accident (post-incident) breath alcohol testing may be
impossible for unconscious, seriously injured, or hospitalized
employees. If this is the case, certified or licensed attending
medical personnel shall take and have analyzed appropriate
specimens to determine if alcohol was present in the employee's
system. Only an accepted method for collecting specimens will be
used. Any failure to do post-accident (post-incident) testing within
two hours must be fully documented by the attending medical
personnel.
(b) Testing based on reasonable suspicion. An alcohol test is
required for each employee where there is reasonable suspicion to believe
the employee is using or is under the influence of alcohol.
The decision to test for reasonable suspicion must be based on a
reasonable and articulate belief that the employee is using or has used
alcohol. This belief should be based on recent, physical, behavioral, or
performance indicators of possible alcohol use. One supervisor who has
received alcohol detection training that complies with DOT regulations
must make the decision to test and must observe the employee's
suspicious behavior.
Supervisory personnel of the Town of Rogersville making a
determination to subject any employee to alcohol testing based on
reasonable suspicion shall document their specific reasons and
observations in writing to the personnel director within eight (8) hours of
the decision to test and before the results of the tests are received by the
department.
(c) Random testing. Only employees of the Town of Rogersville
not terminated possessing or wishing to obtain a commercial driver's
license (CDL) or who are gas department employees are subject to
random alcohol testing. (Note: It is not required that police or fire
department employees be randomly alcohol tested and the town may
want to delete this provision.) It is the policy of the Town of Rogersville
to annually random test for alcohol at least twenty-five (25) percent of the
total number of drivers possessing or obtaining a commercial driver's
license (CDL).
A minimum of fifteen (15) minutes and a maximum of two (2)
hours will be allowed between notification of an employee's selection for
random alcohol testing and the actual presentation for testing.
Random test dates will be unannounced with unpredictable
frequency. Some employees may be tested more than once each year
while others may not be tested at all, depending on the random selection.
4-15
If an employee is unavailable (i.e., vacation, sick day, out of town,
work-related causes, etc.) to be tested on the date random testing occurs,
the Town of Rogersville may omit that employee from that random
testing or await the employee's return to work.
(d) Return to duty and follow-up. Any employee of the Town of
Rogersville who has violated the prohibited alcohol conduct standards
must submit to a return-to-duty test. Follow-up tests will be
unannounced, and at least six (6) tests will be conducted in the first
twelve (12) months after an employee returns to duty. Follow-up testing
may be extended for up to sixty (60) months following return to duty.
The employee will be required to pay for his or her return-to-duty
and follow-up tests accordingly. (Note: Requiring employees to pay for
their return-to-duty and follow-up tests is optional.)
Testing will also be performed on any employee with a CDL
returning from leave or special assignment in excess of six (6) months.
In this situation, the employee will not be required to pay for the testing.
(2) Alcohol testing procedures. All breath alcohol testing conducted for
the Town of Rogersville shall be performed using evidential breath testing (EBT)
equipment and personnel approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). (Note: A town's own public safety department cannot
do this testing unless the test is required because of a traffic accident (incident)).
Alcohol testing is to be performed by a qualified technician as follows:
(a) Step one: An initial breath alcohol test will be performed
using a breath alcohol analysis device approved by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). If the measured result is less
than 0.02 percent breath alcohol level (BAL), the test shall be considered
negative. If the result is greater or equal to 0.04 percent BAL, the result
shall be recorded and witnessed, and the test shall proceed to step two.
(b) Step two: Fifteen minutes shall be allowed to pass following
the completion of step one above. Before the confirmation test or step two
is administered for each employee, the breath alcohol technician shall
insure that the evidential breath testing device registers 0.00 on an air
blank. If the reading is greater than 0.00, the breath alcohol technician
shall conduct one more air blank. If the reading is greater than 0.00,
testing shall not proceed using that instrument. However, testing may
proceed on another instrument. Then step one shall be repeated using a
new mouthpiece and either the same or equivalent but different breath
analysis device.
The breath alcohol level detected in step two shall be recorded and
witnessed.
If the lower of the breath alcohol measurements in step one and
step two is 0.04 percent or greater, the employee shall be considered to
have failed the breath alcohol test. Failure of the breath alcohol test
4-16
shall result in administrative action by proper officials of the Town of
Rogersville up to and including termination of employment.
Any breath level found upon analysis to be between 0.02 percent
BAL and 0.04 percent BAL shall result in the employee's removal from
duty without pay for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. In this
situation, the employee must be retested by breath analysis and found to
have a BAL of up to 0.02 percent before returning to duty with the Town
of Rogersville.
All breath alcohol test results shall be recorded by the technician
and shall be witnessed by the tested employee and by a supervisory
employee of the Town of Rogersville, when possible.
The completed breath alcohol test form shall be submitted to the
personnel director. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-308. Education and training. (1) Supervisory personnel who will
determine reasonable suspicion testing. Training supervisory personnel who
will determine whether an employee must be tested based on reasonable
suspicion will include at the minimum two (2), sixty (60) minute periods of
training on the specific, contemporaneous, physical, behavioral, and
performance indicators of both probably drug use and alcohol use. One (1) sixty
(60) minute period will be for drugs and one will be for alcohol.
The Town of Rogersville will sponsor a drug-free awareness program for
all employees.
(2) Distribution of information. The minimal distribution of
information for all employees will include the display and distribution of:
(a) Informational material on the effects of drug and alcohol
abuse;
(b) An existing community services hotline number, available
drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs for
employee assistance;
(c) The Town of Rogersville policy regarding the use of
prohibited drugs and/or alcohol; and
(d) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug
abuse violations occurring in the workplace. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-309. Consequences of a confirmed positive drug and/or alcohol
test result and/or verified positive drug and/or alcohol test result. Job
applicants will be denied employment with the Town of Rogersville if their
initial positive pre-employment drug and alcohol test results have been
confirmed/verified.
If a current employee's positive drug and alcohol test result has been
confirmed, the employee is subject to immediate removal from any safetysensitive
function and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination. The city may consider the following factors in determining the
4-17
appropriate disciplinary response: the employee's work history, length of
employment, current work assignment, current job performance, and existence
of past disciplinary actions. However, the town reserves the right to allow
employees to participate in an education an/or treatment program approved by
the town Employee Assistance Program as an alternative to or in addition to
disciplinary action. If such a program is offered and accepted by the employee,
then the employee must satisfactorily participate in and complete the program
as a condition of continued employment.
No disciplinary action may be taken pursuant to this drug policy against
employees who voluntarily identify themselves as drug users, obtain counseling
and rehabilitation through the town's Employee Assistance Program or other
program sanctioned by the town, and thereafter refrain from violating the
town's policy on drug and alcohol abuse. However, voluntary identification will
not prohibit disciplinary action for the violation of town personnel policy and
regulations, nor will it relieve the employee of any requirements for return to
duty testing.
Refusing to submit to an alcohol or controlled substances test means that
a driver:
(a) Fails to provide adequate breath for testing without a valid
medical explanation after he or she has received notice of the
requirement for breath testing in accordance with the provisions of this
part;
(b) Fails to provide adequate urine for controlled substances
testing without a valid medical explanation after he or she has received
notice of the requirement for urine testing in accordance with the
provisions of this part; or
(c) Engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing
process.
In either case the physician or breath alcohol technician shall provide a written
statement to the town indicating a refusal to test. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-310. Voluntary disclosure of drug and/or alcohol use. In the
event that an employee of the Town of Rogersville is dependent upon or an
abuser of drugs and/or alcohol and sincerely wishes to seek professional medical
care, that employee should voluntarily discuss his/her problem with the
respective department head in private.
Such voluntary desire for help with a substance abuse problem will be
honored by the Town of Rogersville. If substance abuse treatment is required,
the employee will be removed from active duty pending completion of the
treatment.
Affected employees of the Town of Rogersville may be allowed up to thirty
(30) consecutive calendar days for initial substance abuse treatment as follows:
(1) The employee must use all vacation, sick, and compensatory time
available.
4-18
(2) In the event accumulated vacation, sick, and compensatory time is
insufficient to provide the medically prescribed and needed treatment up to a
maximum of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, the employee will be provided
paid/unpaid leave for the difference between the amount of accumulated leave
and the number of days prescribed and needed for treatment up to the
maximum thirty (30) day treatment period.
Voluntary disclosure must occur before an employee is notified of or
otherwise becomes subject to a pending drug and/or alcohol test.
Prior to any return-to-duty consideration of an employee following
voluntary substance abuse treatment, the employee shall obtain a return-toduty
recommendation from the substance abuse professional (SAP) of the Town
of Rogersville. The SAP may suggest conditions of reinstatement of the
employee that may include after-care and return-to-duty and/or random drug
and alcohol testing requirements. The respective department head and
personnel director of the Town of Rogersville will consider each case individually
and set forth final conditions of reinstatement to active duty. These conditions
of reinstatement must be met by the employee. Failure of the employee to
complete treatment or follow after-care conditions, or subsequent failure of any
drug or alcohol test under this policy will result in administrative action up to
and including termination of employment.
These provisions apply to voluntary disclosure of a substance abuse
problem by an employee of the Town of Rogersville. Voluntary disclosure
provisions do not apply to applicants. Employees found positive during drug
and/or alcohol testing under this policy are subject to administrative action up
to and including termination of employment as specified elsewhere in this
policy. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-311. Exceptions. This policy does not apply to possession, use, or
provision of alcohol and/or drugs by employees in the context of authorized work
assignments (i.e., undercover police enforcement, intoxilyzer demonstrations).
In all such cases, it is the individual employee's responsibility to ensure that job
performance is not adversely affected by the possession, use, or provision of
alcohol. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-312. Modification of policy. This statement of policy may be revised
by the Town of Rogersville at any time to comply with applicable federal and
state regulations that may be implemented, to comply with judicial rulings, or
to meet any changes in the work environment or changes in the drug and alcohol
testing policy of the Town of Rogersville. (Ord. #1-9-96-1, Jan. 1996)
4-313. Definitions. For purposes of the drug and alcohol testing policy,
the following definitions are adopted:
(1) "Alcohol." The intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol,
or other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or isopropyl alcohol.
4-19
(2) "Alcohol concentration." The alcohol in a volume of breath

applied for and is offered a promotion or who has been selected for a special
assignment; a non-uniformed employee who is offered a position as a uniformed
employee; or an employee transferring to or applying for a position requiring a
CDL.
(5) "Breath alcohol technician (BAT)." An individual who instructs
and assists individuals in the alcohol testing process and operates an evidential
breath testing device (EBT).

4-401. Purpose. It is the responsibility of the Town of Rogersville to
provide employees a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards
that may cause death or serious physical harm. In providing services to the
citizens of the Town of Rogersville, employees may come in contact with
life-threatening infectious diseases which can be transmitted through job related
activities. It is important that both citizens and employees are protected from
the transmission of diseases just as it is equally important that neither is
discriminated against because of basic misconceptions about various diseases
and illnesses.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive set of rules and
regulations governing the prevention of discrimination and potential
occupational exposure to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Tuberculosis (TB). (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct.
1993)
4-402. Coverage. Occupational exposures may occur in many ways,
including needle sticks, cut injuries or blood spills. Several classes of employees
are assumed to be at high risk for blood borne infections due to their routinely
increased exposure to infectious material from potentially infected individuals.
Those high risk occupations include but are not limited to:
(1) Paramedics and emergency medical technicians;
(2) Occupational nurses;
4-23
(3) Housekeeping and laundry workers;
(4) Police and security personnel;
(5) Firefighters;
(6) Sanitation and landfill workers; and
(7) Any other employee deemed to be at high risk per this policy and
an exposure determination. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-403. Administration. This infection control policy shall be
administered by the mayor or his/her designated representative who shall have
the following duties and responsibilities:
(1) Exercise leadership in implementation and maintenance of an
effective infection control policy subject to the provisions of this chapter, other
ordinances, the town charter, and federal and state law relating to OSHA
regulations;
(2) Make an exposure determination for all employee positions to
determine a possible exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials;
(3) Maintain records of all employees and incidents subject to the
provisions of this chapter;
(4) Conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the
infection control policy by municipal employees;
(5) Coordinate and document all relevant training activities in support
of the infection control policy;
(6) Prepare and recommend to the board of mayor and aldermen any
amendments or changes to the infection control policy;
(7) Identify any and all housekeeping operations involving substantial
risk of direct exposure to potentially infectious materials and shall address the
proper precautions to be taken while cleaning rooms and blood spills; and
(8) Perform such other duties and exercise such other authority as may
be prescribed by the board of mayor and aldermen. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-404. Definitions. (1) "Body fluids" - fluids that have been recognized
by the Center for Disease Control as directly linked to the transmission of HIV
and/or HBV and/or to which universal precautions apply: blood, semen, blood
products, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid,
amniotic fluid, and concentrated HIV or HBV viruses.
(2) "Exposure" - the contact with blood or other potentially infectious
materials to which universal precautions apply through contact with open
wounds, non-intact skin, or mucous membranes during the performance of an
individual's normal job duties.
(3) "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)" - a serious blood-borne virus with
potential for life-threatening complications. Possible complications include:
massive hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic active hepatitis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
4-24
(4) "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)" - the virus that causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through
sexual contact and exposure to infected blood or blood components and
perinatally from mother to neonate.
(5) "Tuberculosis (TB)" - an acute or chronic communicable disease
that usually affects the respiratory system, but may involve any system in the
body.
(6) "Universal precautions" - refers to a system of infectious disease
control which assumes that every direct contact with body fluid is infectious and
requires every employee exposed to direct contact with potentially infectious
materials to be protected as though such body fluid were HBV or HIV infected.
(Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-405. Policy statement. All blood and other potentially infectious
materials are infectious for several blood-borne pathogens. Some body fluids
can also transmit infections. For this reason, the Center for Disease Control
developed the strategy that everyone should always take particular care when
there is a potential exposure. These precautions have been termed "universal
precautions."
Universal precautions stress that all persons should be assumed to be
infectious for HIV and/or other blood-borne pathogens. Universal precautions
apply to blood, tissues, and other potentially infectious materials. Universal
precautions also apply to semen, (although occupational risk or exposure is quite
limited), vaginal secretions, and to cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal,
pericardial and amniotic fluids. Universal precautions do not apply to feces,
nasal secretions, human breast milk, sputum, saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and
vomitus unless these substances contain visible blood. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct.
1993)
4-406. General guidelines. General guidelines which shall be used by
everyone include:
(1) Think when responding to emergency calls and exercise common
sense when there is potential exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials which require universal precautions.
(2) Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandages
which repel liquids.
(3) Soap and water kill many bacteria and viruses on contact. If hands
are contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials to which
universal precautions apply, then wash immediately and thoroughly. Hands
shall also be washed after gloves are removed even if the gloves appear to be
intact. When soap and water or handwashing facilities are not available, then
use a waterless antiseptic hand cleaner according to the manufacturers
recommendation for the product.
4-25
(4) All workers shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused by
needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp instruments. To prevent needle stick
injuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand,
removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After
they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp
items shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal. The
puncture resistant container shall be located as close as practical to the use
area.
(5) The town will provide gloves of appropriate material, quality and
size for each affected employee. The gloves are to be worn when there is contact
(or when there is a potential contact) with blood or other potentially infectious
materials to which universal precautions apply:
(a) While handling an individual where exposure is possible;
(b) While cleaning or handling contaminated items or
equipment;
(c) While cleaning up an area that has been contaminated with
one of the above.
Gloves shall not be used if they are peeling, cracked, or discolored, or if
they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration. Employees shall
not wash or disinfect surgical or examination gloves for reuse.
(6) Resuscitation equipment shall be used when necessary. (No
transmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has
been documented.) However, because of the risk of salivary transmission of
other infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV or HBV transmission
during artificial resuscitation, bags shall be used. Pocket mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation masks designed to isolate emergency response personnel from
contact with a victims' blood and blood contaminated saliva, respiratory
secretion, and vomitus, are available to all personnel who provide or potentially
provide emergency treatment.
(7) Masks or protective eyewear or face shields shall be worn during
procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other potentially
infectious materials to prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the mouth,
nose, and eyes. They are not required for routine care.
(8) Gowns, aprons, or lab coats shall be worn during procedures that
are likely to generate splashes of blood or other potentially infectious materials.
(9) Areas and equipment contaminated with blood shall be cleaned as
soon as possible. A household (chlorine) bleach solution (1 part chlorine to 10
parts water) shall be applied to the contaminated surface as a disinfectant
leaving it on for a least 30 seconds. A solution must be changed and re-mixed
every 24 hours to be effective.
(10) Contaminated clothing (or other articles) shall be handled carefully
and washed as soon as possible. Laundry and dish washing cycles at one
hundred twenty degrees (120E) are adequate for decontamination.
4-26
(11) Place all disposable equipment (gloves, masks, gowns, etc...) in a
clearly marked plastic bag. Place the bag in a second clearly marked bag
(double bag). Seal and dispose of by placing in a designated "hazardous"
dumpster. NOTE: Sharp objects must be placed in an impervious container and
properly disposed of.
(12) Tags shall be used as a means of preventing accidental injury or
illness to employees who are exposed to hazardous or potentially hazardous
conditions, equipment or operations which are out of the ordinary, unexpected
or not readily apparent. Tags shall be used until such time as the identified
hazard is eliminated or the hazardous operation is completed.
All required tags shall meet the following criteria:
(a) Tags shall contain a signal word and a major message. The
signal word shall be "BIOHAZARD," or the biological hazard symbol. The
major message shall indicate the specific hazardous condition or the
instruction to be communicated to employees.
(b) The signal word shall be readable at a minimum distance of
five (5) feet or such greater distance as warranted by the hazard.
(c) All employees shall be informed of the meaning of the
various tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions
are necessary.
(13) Linen soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials
shall be handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent
contamination of the person handling the linen. All soiled linen shall be bagged
at the location where it was used. It shall not be sorted or rinsed in the area.
Soiled linen shall be placed and transported in bags that prevent leakage.
The employee responsible for transported soiled linen should always wear
protective gloves to prevent possible contamination. After removing the gloves,
hands or other skin surfaces shall be washed thoroughly and immediately after
contact with potentially infectious materials.
(14) Whenever possible, disposable equipment shall be used to minimize
and contain clean-up. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-407. Hepatitis B vaccinations. The Town of Rogersville shall offer
the appropriate Hepatitis B vaccination to employees at risk of exposure free of
charge and in amounts and at times prescribed by standard medical practices.
The vaccination shall be voluntarily administered. High risk employees who
wish to take the HBV vaccination should notify their department head who shall
make the appropriate arrangements through the Infectious Disease Control
Coordinator. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-408. Reporting potential exposure. Town employees shall observe
the following procedures for reporting a job exposure incident that may put them
at risk for HIV or HBV infections (i.e., needle sticks, blood contact on broken
skin, body fluid contact with eyes or mouth, etc...):
4-27
(1) Notify the Infectious Disease Control Coordinator of the contact
incident and details thereof.
(2) Complete the appropriate accident reports and any other specific
form required.
(3) Arrangements will be made for the person to be seen by a physician
as with any job-related injury.
Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample should be drawn after
consent is obtained from the individual from whom exposure occurred and tested
for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody). Testing of the source individual should
be done at a location where appropriate pretest counseling is available. Post-test
counseling and referral for treatment should also be provided. (Ord. #8-10-93-2,
Oct. 1993)
4-409. Hepatitis B virus post-exposure management. For an
exposure to a source individual found to be positive for HBsAg, the worker who
has not previously been given the hepatitis B vaccine should receive the vaccine
series. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is also
recommended, if it can be given within seven (7) days of exposure.
For exposure from an HBsAg-positive source to workers who have
previously received the vaccine, the exposed worker should be tested for
antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and given one dose of
vaccine and one dose of HBIG if the antibody level in the worker's blood sample
is inadequate (ie., 10 SRU by RIA, negative by EIA).
If the source individual is negative for HBsAg and the worker has not
been vaccinated, this opportunity should be taken to provide the hepatitis B
vaccine series. HBIG administration should be considered on an individual
basis when the source individual is known or suspected to be at high risk of
HBV infection. Management and treatment, if any, of previously vaccinated
workers who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or is not
identifiable should be individualized. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-410. Human immunodeficiency virus post-exposure
management. For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who is
found to be positive for HIV infection, or who refuses testing, the worker should
be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and
serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure.
The worker should be advised to report and seek medical evaluation for any
acute febrile illness that occurs within twelve (12) weeks after the exposure.
Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash, or
lymphadenopathy, may be indicative of recent HIV infection.
Following the initial test at the time of exposure, seronegative workers
should be retested six (6) weeks, twelve (12) weeks, and six (6) months after
exposure to determine whether transmission has occurred. During this
4-28
follow-up period (especially the first 6 - 12 weeks after exposure) exposed
workers should follow the U.S. Public Health service recommendation for
preventing transmission of HIV. These include refraining from blood donations
and using appropriate protection during sexual intercourse. During all phases
of follow-up, it is vital that worker confidentiality be protected.
If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, baseline
testing of the exposed worker with follow-up testing twelve (12) weeks later
may be performed if desired by the worker or recommended by the health care
provider. If the source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding
appropriate follow-up should be individualized. Serologic testing should be
made available by the town to all workers who may be concerned they have been
infected with HIV through an occupational exposure. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct.
1993)
4-411. Disability benefits. Entitlement to disability benefits and any
other benefits available for employees who suffer from on-the-job injuries will
be determined by the Tennessee Worker's Compensations Bureau in accordance
with the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 50-6-303. (Ord. #8-10-93-2,
Oct. 1993)
4-412. Training regular employees. On an annual basis all employees
shall receive training and education on precautionary measures, epidemiology,
modes of transmission and prevention of HIV/HBV infection and procedures to
be used if they are exposed to needle sticks or potentially infectious materials.
They shall also be counseled regarding possible risks to the fetus from
HIV/HBV and other associated infectious agents. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-413. Training high risk employees. In addition to the above, high
risk employees shall also receive training regarding the location and proper use
of personal protective equipment. They shall be trained concerning proper work
practices and understand the concept of "universal precautions" as it applies to
their work situation. They shall also be trained about the meaning of color
coding and other methods used to designate contaminated material. Where tags
are used, training shall cover precautions to be used in handling contaminated
material as per this policy. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-414. Training new employees. During the new employee's
orientation to his/her job, all new employees will be trained on the effects of
infectious disease prior to putting them to work. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-415. Records and reports. (1) Reports. Occupational injury and
illness records shall be maintained by the infectious disease control coordinator.
Statistics shall be maintained on the OSHA-200 report. Only those
work-related injuries that involve loss of consciousness, transfer to another job,
4-29
restriction of work or motion, or medical treatment are required to be put on the
OSHA-200.
(2) Needle sticks. Needle sticks, like any other puncture wound, are
considered injuries for recordkeeping purposes due to the instantaneous nature
of the event. Therefore, any needle stick requiring medical treatment (i.e.
gamma globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, hepatitis B vaccine, etc...) shall
be recorded.
(3) Prescription medication. Likewise, the use of prescription
medication (beyond a single dose for minor injury or discomfort) is considered
medical treatment. Since these types of treatment are considered necessary,
and must be administered by physician or licensed medical personnel, such
injuries cannot be considered minor and must be reported.
(4) Employee interviews. Should the town be inspected by the U.S.
Department of Labor Office of Health Compliance, the compliance safety and
health officer may wish to interview employees. Employees are expected to
cooperate fully with the compliance officers. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)
4-416. Legal rights of victims of communicable diseases. Victims
of communicable diseases have the legal right to expect, and municipal
employees, including police and emergency service officers are duty bound to
provide, the same level of service and enforcement as any other individual would
receive.
(1) Officers assume that a certain degree of risk exists in law
enforcement and emergency service work and accept those risks with their
individual appointments. This holds true with any potential risks of contacting
a communicable disease as surely as it does with the risks of confronting an
armed criminal.
(2) Any officer who refuses to take proper action in regard to victims
of a communicable disease, when appropriate protective equipment is available,
shall be subject to disciplinary measures along with civil and, or criminal
prosecution.
(3) Whenever an officer mentions in a report that an individual has or
may have a communicable disease, he shall write "contains confidential medical
information" across the top margin of the first page of the report.
(4) The officer's supervisor shall ensure that the above statement is on
all reports requiring that statement at the time the report is reviewed and
initiated by the supervisor.
(5) The supervisor disseminating newspaper releases shall make
certain the confidential information is not given out to the news media.
(6) All requests (including subpoenas) for copies of reports marked
"contains confidential medical information" shall be referred to the town
attorney when the incident involves an indictable or juvenile offense.
4-30
(7) Prior approval shall be obtained from the town attorney before
advising a victim of sexual assault that the suspect has, or is suspected of
having a communicable disease.
(8) All circumstance, not covered in this policy, that may arise
concerning releasing confidential information regarding a victim, or suspected
victim, of a communicable disease shall be referred directly to the appropriate
department head or town attorney.
(9) Victims of a communicable disease and their families have a right
to conduct their lives without fear of discrimination. An employee shall not
make public, directly or indirectly, the identity of a victim or suspected victim
of a communicable disease.
(10) Whenever an employee finds it necessary to notify another
employee, police officer, firefighter, emergency service officer, or health care
provider that a victim has or is suspected of having a communicable disease,
that information shall be conveyed in a dignified, discrete and confidential
manner. The person to whom the information is being conveyed should be
reminded that the information is confidential and that it should not be treated
as public information.
(11) Any employee who disseminates confidential information in regard
to a victim, or suspected victim of a communicable disease in violation of this
policy shall be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or civil/and/or criminal
prosecution. (Ord. #8-10-93-2, Oct. 1993)

TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT REGULATIONS
SECTION
4-501. Purpose.
4-502. Enforcement.
4-503. Travel policy.
4-504. Travel reimbursement rate schedules.
4-501. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter and referenced regulations
is to bring the town into compliance with Public Acts 1993, Chapter 433. This
Act requires Tennessee municipalities to adopt travel and expense regulations
covering expenses incurred by any mayor and any member of the local governing
body and any board or committee member elected or appointed by the mayor or
local governing body, and any official or employee of the municipality whose
salary is set by charter or general law.
To provide consistent travel regulations and reimbursement, this chapter
is expanded to cover regular town employees. It is the intent of this policy to
assure fair and equitable treatment to all individuals traveling on municipal
business at town expense. (Ord. #8-10-93-1, Oct. 1993)
4-502. Enforcement. The chief administrative officer (CAO) of the
municipality or his or her designee shall be responsible for the enforcement of
these travel regulations. (Ord. #8-10-93-1, Oct. 1993)
4-503. Travel policy. (1) In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, the term "traveler" or "authorized traveler" means any elected or
appointed municipal officer or employee, including members of municipal boards
and committees appointed by the mayor or the municipal governing body, and
the employees of such boards and committees who are traveling on official
municipal business and whose travel was authorized in accordance with this
chapter. "Authorized traveler" shall not include the spouse, children, other
relatives, friends, or companions accompanying the authorized traveler on
municipal business, unless the person(s) otherwise qualifies as an authorized
traveler under this chapter.
(2) Authorized travelers are entitled to reimbursement of certain
expenditures incurred while traveling on official business for the town.
Reimbursable expenses shall include expenses for transportation; lodging;
meals; registration fees for conferences, conventions, and seminars; and other
actual and necessary expenses related to official business and determined by the
CAO. Under certain conditions, entertainment expenses may be eligible for
reimbursement.
4-32
(3) Authorized travelers can request either a travel advance for the
projected cost of authorized travel, or advance billing directly to the town for
registration fees, airfares, meals, lodging, conferences, and similar expenses.
Travel advance requests are not considered documentation of travel
expenses. If travel advances exceed documented expenses, the traveler must
immediately reimburse the town. It will be the responsibility of the CAO to
initiate action to recover any undocumented travel advances.
(4) Travel advances are available only for special travel and only after
completion and approval of the travel authorization form.
(5) The travel expense reimbursement form will be used to document
all expense claims.
(6) To qualify for reimbursement, travel expenses must be:
(a) Directly related to the conduct of the municipal business for
which travel was authorized, and
(b) Actual, reasonable, and necessary under the circumstances.
The CAO may make exceptions for unusual circumstances. Expenses
considered excessive will not be allowed.
(7) Claims of five dollars ($5.00) or more for travel expense
reimbursement must be supported by the original paid receipt for lodging,
vehicle rental, phone call, public carrier travel, conference fee, and other
reimbursable costs.
(8) Any person attempting to defraud the town or misuse town travel
funds is subject to legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/or
advances.
(9) Mileage and motel expenses incurred within the town are not
ordinarily considered eligible expenses for reimbursement. (Ord. #8-10-93-1,
Oct. 1993)
4-504. Travel reimbursement rate schedules. Authorized travelers
shall be reimbursed according to the federal travel regulation rates. The
municipal travel reimbursement rates will automatically change when the
federal rates are adjusted.
The municipality may pay directly to the provider for expenses such as
meals, lodging, and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars, and
other education programs. (Ord. #8-10-93-1, Oct. 1993)

failure of any plumbing contractor or his agent or employee in charge of the

fixtures in violation of the plumbing code, or to otherwise create conditions
making additional inspection necessary will be charged for at the rate of three

their employees. (1986 Code, § 4-409)

in force in Rogersville will be permitted to do such work in Rogersville, after
having purchased from the recorder, upon recommendation of the building
official, the necessary permits governing the work. Only one such permit per
year will be issued under the above conditions. (1986 Code, § 4-607)
12-608. Inspections. At least two inspections shall be made on each job.
The first one shall be made when the work is roughed in (all connections made
up and soldered or approved connectors not taped), and the second when the job
is finished. On jobs where, due to size or type of construction it would not be
practical to get all the wiring ready for inspection at one time, inspections will
be made as often as is necessary.
No work shall be covered until the proper inspections have been made and
approval given. The contractor or the person responsible for any work covered
before it is inspected and approved will be required to uncover the work at their
expense in order that the proper inspection might be made.
No service equipment or wiring shall be installed in attics, lofts, or upper
floors unless there is a ladder or stairway furnished so that work will be
accessible at the time the request for an inspection is made.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve the contractor,
owner, or operator of an electric contracting business of full responsibility for
work done by their employees. (1986 Code, § 4-608)
12-609. Reinspections. The electric inspector shall make periodically
a thorough reinspection of the installation of all electric wiring, devices,
appliances, and equipment now installed or that may hereafter be installed
within the town and within the scope of this chapter. When the installation of
any such wiring, devices, appliances, or equipment is found to be in a dangerous
or unsafe condition, the person, firm, or corporation owning, using, or operating
it shall be notified in writing and shall make the necessary repairs or changes
12-18
required to place such wiring, devices, and equipment in safe condition. Such
work shall be completed within ten (10) days, or any longer period specified by
the electric inspector in the notice. Upon failure of the contractor to comply with
the notice, the electric inspector will and is hereby granted authority to have the
electric service discontinued until the recommended repairs or changes are
made. Reinspection shall be made at least once in every two years of all electric
wiring, devices, appliances, and equipment in all automobile service stations,
garages, hotels, rooming houses, auditoriums, and all other places used for
public gatherings and seating more than sixty (60) persons. No fee will be
charged for such inspections. (1986 Code, § 4-609)
12-610. Extra inspections. Extra inspections made necessary through
failure of any electric contractor, his agents, or employees in charge of the work
to specify properly the location of the work, or to install wiring or apparatus in
the proper manner, or otherwise to create conditions making additional
inspection necessary will be charged for at the rate of three dollars ( $3.00) per
trip. (1986 Code, § 4-610)
12-611. Review of inspection decisions. When the electric inspector
condemns all or a part of any electrical installation, the owner may, within five
days after receiving written notice form the building official, file a petition in
writing with the mayor for review of the action of the building official. Upon
receipt of the petition the mayor shall at once proceed to determine if the electric
installation complies with this chapter and within three days shall make a
decision in accordance with his findings. (1986 Code, § 4-611)
12-612. Inspection fees. The schedule of fees to be charged for the
inspection of wiring for lights, heat, and power and all other electrical
equipment shall be as set by resolution of the board of mayor and aldermen.
(1986 Code, § 4-612)
12-613. Installation and maintenance of television and radio
antennae. All television antennae or masts and their appurtenances now
existing or hereafter erected in the town shall comply with the following
regulations and the applicable rules and regulations of the National Electric
Code.
Before erecting any television antennae or masts or their appurtenances,
application shall be made to the building official for a permit therefor. The
application shall set forth detailed information regarding the location, type of
antennae, and materials to be used, all of which shall conform to the provisions
of this chapter. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one dollar
($1.00) payable to the Town of Rogersville. When the application shows that the
proposed work and equipment conform with these regulations, the building
official shall issue a permit therefor. Where the application fails to show
12-19
conformity to the provisions hereof, a permit shall be denied. It shall be
unlawful for any person hereafter to erect a television antenna or mast or
appurtenance without obtaining a permit from the building official. It shall be
unlawful for any person to maintain or use or to have on his premises a
television antenna or mast or appurtenance thereto unless they conform to these

all new piping authorized by the permit has been installed, and before the
piping has been covered or concealed or any fixtures or gas appliances have been
attached thereto.
(2) A final piping inspection shall be made after all piping authorized
by the permit has been installed and after all portions thereof which are to be
concealed by plastering or otherwise have been so concealed, and before any
fixtures or gas appliances have been attached thereto. This inspection shall
include a pressure test, at which time the piping shall stand an air pressure
equal to not less than the pressure of a column of mercury six (6) inches in
height, and the piping shall hold this air pressure for a period of at least ten (10)
minutes without any perceptible drop. A mercury column gauge shall be used
for the test. All tools, apparatus, labor, and assistance necessary for the test
shall be furnished by the installer of the piping. (1986 Code, § 4-708)
12-709. Certificates. The inspector shall issue a certificate of approval
at the completion of the work for which a permit for consumer piping has been

of the gas code. A duplicate of each certificate issued covering consumer's gas
piping shall be delivered to the gas company and used as its authority to render
gas service. (1986 Code, § 4-709)

license of the person may be revoked, or both fine and revocation of license may
be imposed. (1986 Code, § 4-711)
12-712. Nonliability. This chapter shall not be construed as imposing
upon the town any liability or responsibility for damages to any person injured
by any defect in any gas piping or appliance mentioned herein, or by installation
thereof, nor shall the town, or any official or employee thereof, be held as
assuming any such liability or responsibility by reason of the inspection
authorized hereunder or the certificate of approval issued by the inspector.(1986

15-809. Enforcement. (1) Any certified officer of the Town of
Rogersville who had determined, by use of a sound meter test as hereinabove
provided, that the prohibitions of this chapter have been violated shall issue a
summons to the operator of the vehicle in question, requiring him to appear
before the municipal judge, as in the case of other offenses against the town, at
a date and time certain to answer the charge. The officer in each case shall
inform the operator to be charged with the offense that
15-23
(a) The operator has the option of first appearing at a place and
time designated by the officer prior to the date the operator is to appear
in court for a second noise meter test of the vehicle in question; and
(b) If the operator elects to schedule a second test, but fails to
appear with the vehicle at the scheduled time and place, then he will be
conclusively presumed to have committed the violation alleged in the
summons. The fact that the operator has been so informed as above
specified, together with his acceptance or rejection of the second test
option shall appear upon the face of all copies of the summons, together
with the date, time, and place the second test, if any, is scheduled. No
test shall be scheduled to take place less than seventy two (72) hours
following the date and time of the issuance of the summons. If the
operator fails to appear for the scheduled test, then the testing officer
shall note the failure to appear on the reverse side of the original
summons and transmit the summons to the court. Failure to appear
shall create a conclusive presumption that the operator was in violation
of this chapter at the date and time the summons was originally issued;
and all copies of the summons shall contain, at the time of issuance, a
written statement, on the face thereof or appended thereto, setting forth
the presumption. If the operator appears with the vehicle for the second
test as set forth above, then the testing officer shall conduct a sound level
meter test of the vehicle as herein provided, and shall note the results of
the test, together with any other comments the officer may have, on the
reverse side of the original summons. Such comments may include, if
appropriate, a recommendation that bond be reduced. The summons
shall then be transmitted to the court as in other cases, and the results
of the second test, together with the officer's comments, shall be evidence
at the hearing.
(2) Any certified officer having probable cause to believe that a
violation of this chapter has been committed in his presence, regardless of
whether a sound meter test was used to determine the violation, shall likewise
issue a summons to the operator of the vehicle in question, requiring the
operator to appear and answer the charge. In cases where the summons is
issued without a sound meter test as herein provided, the officer shall require
the operator to first appear at a designated time and place not less than seventy
two (72) hours following the date and time of the issuance of the summons, for
a soundmeter test of the vehicle in question. Such cases shall otherwise proceed
in the same manner as cases under subsection (1) above, wherein the summons
is first issued pursuant to sound meter tests; and the presumption of violation
arising from failure to appear for the designated test shall likewise apply.
(3) The authority to issue summonses for violations of subsections (1)
and (3) of § 15-805 pertaining to the operation of motor vehicles without a
muffling device, and the sounding of any horn or signaling device except as a
danger warning shall not be confined to certified officers as herein defined; but
15-24
any police officer of the Town of Rogersville is hereby empowered to issue
summonses for violations of those subsections. (1986 Code, § 9-709)

the provisions of this chapter; and it shall also be unlawful to violate, or vary
from, the terms of any such permit; any person maintaining pipes, lines, or
other underground facilities in or under the surface of any street may proceed

work to be done immediately and a permit cannot reasonably and practicably
be obtained beforehand. The person shall thereafter apply for a permit on the
first regular business day on which the office of the recorder is open for
business, and said permit shall be retroactive to the date when the work was
begun. (1986 Code, § 12-201)
16-202. Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to
the recorder, or such person as he may designate to receive such applications,
and shall state thereon the location of the intended excavation or tunnel, the

others doing the actual excavating, the name of the person, firm, corporation,
association, or others for whom the work is being done, and shall contain an

16-203. Fee. The fee for such permits shall be two dollars ($2.00) for
excavations which do not exceed twenty-five (25) square feet in area or tunnels
not exceeding twenty-five (25) feet in length; and twenty-five cents ($.25) for

involved or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if the excavation is in a paved area and
shall insure the proper restoration of the ground and laying of the pavement, if
any. Where the amount of the deposit is clearly inadequate to cover the cost of
restoration, the recorder may increase the amount of the deposit to an amount
considered by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From this deposit shall be
deducted the expense to the town of relaying the surface of the ground or
pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the town or at its expense.
The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest after the tunnel
or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or pavement is restored.
In lieu of a deposit the applicant may deposit with the recorder a surety

to the town if the applicant fails to make proper restoration. (1986 Code,

16-206. Restoration of streets, etc. Any person, firm, corporation,
association, or others making any excavation or tunnel in or under any street,
alley, or public place in this town shall restore the street, alley, or public place
to its original condition except for the surfacing, which shall be done by the
town, but shall be paid for promptly upon completion by the person, firm,
corporation, association, or others for which the excavation or tunnel was made.
In case of unreasonable delay in restoring the street, alley, or public place, the
recorder shall give notice to the person, firm, corporation, association, or others
16-6
that unless the excavation or tunnel is refilled properly within a specified
reasonable period of time, the town will do the work and charge the expense of
doing it to the person, firm, corporation, association, or others. If within the
specified time the conditions of the above notice have not been complied with,
the work shall be done by the town, an accurate account of the expense involved
shall be kept, and the total cost shall be charged to the person, firm, corporation,
association, or others who made the excavation or tunnel. (1986 Code, § 12-206)

hereinbefore required to insure that proper restoration is made, each person
applying for an excavation permit shall file a certificate of insurance indicating
that he is insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as
against claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance be by himself, his
subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him. The insurance
shall cover collapse, explosive hazards, and underground work by equipment on
the street, and shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations. The amount of the insurance shall be prescribed by the recorder in
accordance with the nature of the risk involved; the liability insurance for bodily
injury shall not be less than $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each
accident, and for property damages not less than $25,000 for any one (1)
accident, and a $75,000 aggregate. (1986 Code, § 12-207)
16-208. Time limits. Each application for a permit shall state the
length of time it is estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work
until the restoration of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill
is made ready for the pavement to be put on by the town if the town restores the
surface pavement. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with this time
limitation unless permission for an extension of time is granted by the recorder.

18-108. State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this chapter. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April
1997)
18-109. Town's right of revision. The town reserves the right to
establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges
to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in
§ 18-101 of this chapter. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-110. Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of
process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in
any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the town or state. (Ord.
#2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-111. Slug discharges. (1) Each industrial user shall provide
protection from slug discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and
shall be approved by the town before construction of the facility. All existing
18-14
users shall complete such a plan within one hundred eighty (180) days from the
effective date of the ordinance comprising this chapter. No user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance comprising
this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until slug
discharge procedures have been approved by the town. Review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from
the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter. In the case of a slug discharge, it is the
responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of this
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(2) Written notice. Within five (5) days following a slug discharge, the
user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
(3) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a slug discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who
may cause or suffer such a slug discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedures. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-112. Discharge of hazardous wastes. (1) All industrial users shall
notify the town, the EPA Region IV Waste Management Division Director, and
the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Solid
Waste Management in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part
261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth
in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch or other).
(2) If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100)
kilograms of such wastes per calendar month to the POTW, the notification
shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimate of the mass and
concentration of such constituents discharged during that calendar month, and
an estimate of the mass and concentration of such constituents expected to be
discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
(3) Notification shall be provided within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the discharge. Notification need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged; however, advance notification of substantial change is
required.
18-15
Rate schedules of charges and fees are available in the office of the 1
recorder.
(4) Industrial users are exempt from notification requirements if
(a) The pollutants are already monitored and reported under
the user's permit requirements; or
(b) Less than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous
wastes are discharged within a calendar month.
(5) If new regulations identify additional characteristics of hazardous
wastes or list new hazardous wastes, notification of the appropriate authorities
by the industrial user is required within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
(6) If notification is required, the industrial user shall certify that it
has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. (Ord.
#2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-113. Charges and fees. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this 1
section to provide a schedule of charges and fees which will enable the town to
comply with the revenue requirements of section 204 of the Clean Water Act.
Charges and fees shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
regulations of the Federal Grant Program to ensure that sufficient revenues are
collected to defray the cost of operating and maintaining, including replacement,
adequate wastewater collection and treatment system. Specific charges and fees
shall be adopted by a separate ordinance; this section describes the procedure
to be used in calculating the charges and fees. Additional charges and fees to
recover funds for capital outlay, bond service costs and capital improvements
may be assessed by the town. These charges and fees shall be recovered through
the user classification established hereinafter.
(2) Classification of users. All users shall be classified by the water
superintendent either by assigning each one to a user classification category
according to the principal activity conducted on the user's premises, by
individual user analysis, or by a combination thereof. The purpose of
classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges based on
wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(3) Types of charges and fees. The town may adopt charges and fees
which may include, but are not limited to:
(a) User classification charges;
(b) Fees for monitoring requested by a user;
(c) Fees for permit application;
(d) Appeal fees;
(e) Charges and fees based on wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
(f) Fee for use of garbage grinders;
(g) Fees for holding tank wastes;
18-16
(h) Fees for reimbursement of administrative costs related to
the pretreatment program;
(i) Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures;
(j) Fees for reviewing accidental discharge prevention
procedures and construction;
(k) Fees for allowing connection of building sewers to the
POTW.
(4) Basis of determination of charges. Charges and fees may be based
upon a minimum basic charge for each premise, computed on the basis of
"normal wastewater" from a domestic premise with the following characteristics:
5 BOD 300 milligrams per liter
COD 600 milligrams per liter
TKN 60 milligrams per liter
3 NH -N 30 milligrams per liter
Suspended Solids 300 milligrams per liter
Total Dissolved Solids 3,000 milligrams per liter
Oil and grease 70 milligrams per liter
The charges and fees for all classifications of users other than the basic
domestic premise shall be based upon the relative difference between the
average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as
related to those of a domestic premise.
The charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the
measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater
discharge of that user which may include, but not be limited to, BOD, COD, SS,
3 NH as N, chlorine demand, and volume.
(5) User charges. The fair user charge fee schedule consists of a flat
base charge based on an equitable distribution of the administrative costs of
providing sewer service to all customers connected to the POTW and to each lot,
parcel of land or premises which may now or hereinafter be located within two
hundred (200) feet of a sanitary sewer owned by the town, plus an equitable
distribution of the costs of operating expenses, debt amortization and
depreciation to all customers connected to the POTW based on water usages as
determined by water meters owned by the town. A surcharge will be levied
against those users which discharge wastewater that exceeds the strength of
"normal wastewater." The owner or occupant of property obtaining water from
a source or sources other than through a meter of the town, which water is
discharged into the POTW shall install, without cost to the town, a meter or
meters to measure the quantity of water received from any such source or
sources and shall pay the same rate or rates as provided in this section. No
meter shall be installed or used for such purpose without the approval of the
superintendent.
Whenever a property upon which a fair user charge is hereby imposed
uses water for industrial, commercial, or air conditioning purposes, and does not
18-17
discharge it into the POTW but, through agreement with the POTW, discharges
it in some other manner, including discharging it into the town's storm sewer
system, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the POTW, shall
be excluded in determining the sewer service charge of said owner or occupant.
However, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the POTW must
be measured by a device or meter approved by the town and installed by the
owner or occupant without cost to the POTW. The current fair user charge fee
schedule and the method used in calculating the fee schedule shall at all times
be maintained on file by the superintendent for inspection by the public.
(6) Operation and maintenance user charges. Each user's share of
operation and maintenance costs will be computed by the following formula:
Cu = Ct x (Vu)
Vt
Where:
Cu = User's charge for O&M per unit of time.
Ct = Total O&M cost per unit of time.
Vt = Total volume contribution from all users per unit of time.
Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time.
Operation and maintenance charges may be established on a percentage of
water use charge only in the event that water use charges are based on a
constant cost per unit of consumption.
(7) Notification. Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges
which are attributable to wastewater treatment services.
(8) Biennial review of operation and maintenance charges. The town
shall review not less often than every two (2) years the wastewater contribution
of users and user classes, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the
treatment works and its approved user charge system. The town shall revise
the charges for users or user classes to accomplish the following:
(a) Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among users and user classes as required herein;
(b) Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance
(including replacement) of the treatment works; and
(c) Apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the
costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next
year and adjust the rate accordingly. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-18
18-114. Wastewater dischargers. It shall be unlawful to discharge
without a NPDES permit to any natural outlet within the Town of Rogersville,
or in any area under the jurisdiction of said town, any wastewater except as
authorized by the water superintendent in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. It shall be unlawful to discharge without a Town of Rogersville permit
any wastewater to the POTW except as authorized by the superintendent in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-115. Wastewater contribution permits. (1) General permits. All
users proposing to discharge non-domestic waste to the POTW shall obtain a
wastewater contribution permit before connecting to or contributing to the
POTW. Any existing connected user discharging waste other than domestic
waste shall obtain a wastewater contribution permit within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of this chapter.
(2) Permit application. Users required to obtain a wastewater
contribution permit shall complete and file with the superintendent an

The town will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished,
the town may issue a wastewater contribution permit subject to terms and
conditions provided herein.
(3) Permit modifications. Within nine (9) months of the promulgation
of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the users, subject to such
standards, shall apply for a permit modification to require compliance with such
standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user,
subject to national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater contribution permit, as required by
18-20
subsection (2) of this section, the user shall apply for a wastewater contribution
permit within one hundred eighty (180) days after the promulgation of the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In addition, the user,
with an existing wastewater contribution permit shall submit to the
superintendent within one hundred eighty (180) days after the promulgation of
an applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard the information
required by subsection (2)(h) and (i) above.

the POTW.
(l) Requirements for notification of slug discharges; and
(m) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the town to
ensure compliance with this chapter.
(5) Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply
for permit re-issuance a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit
may be subject to modification by the town during the term of the permit as
limitations or requirements as identified in § 18-104 are modified or other just
cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit
18-21
at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or
new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance.
(6) Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation at a specific location. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner,
new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the
approval of the town. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the
terms and conditions of the existing permit. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-116. Reporting requirements for permittee. (1) Compliance date
report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user
subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants
in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the significant industrial user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional
engineer registered to practice engineering in the State of Tennessee.
(2) Periodic compliance reports. (a) An industrial user subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the superintendent, upon
request, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in
the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standard and the
sewer use ordinance. In addition, this report may also be required to
include a report of all daily flows which, during the reporting period,
exceed the average daily flow reported in § 18-115(4)(c) of this chapter.
(b) The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users
to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in any
other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In
such cases, the report required by subsection (1) of this section shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in
the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration of production and mass where requested by the
superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards. These reports shall be made
18-22
available to the approval authority upon request. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard.
All analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures
established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any
other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be
approved by the administrator. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-117. Monitoring facilities. The town shall require to be provided
and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written
notification by the town. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-118. Inspection and sampling. The town shall inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town or its representative
as well as representatives of the State of Tennessee and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the
performance of any of their duties. The town, state and/or EPA shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where
a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the town, state, and EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-119. Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
18-23
with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations
as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the town shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans, prepared by a
professional engineer registered to practice engineering in the State of
Tennessee, showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures, shall
be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the
town before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the town under the
provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes to the pretreatment
facilities shall be reported to and be acceptable to the town prior to the user's
initiation of the changes.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. (Ord.
#2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-120. Confidential information. Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter
and the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the state and any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
Information, accepted by the town as confidential, shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the town
until and unless a thirty (30) day notification is given to the user. (Ord.
#2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-121. Private sewage disposal. Where any residence, office,
recreational facility or other establishments used for human occupancy is not
accessible to the POTW, the user shall provide a private sewage disposal system.
Where any residence, office, recreational facility, or other establishment used
for human occupancy, where the building drain is below the elevation to obtain
a one (1) percent grade in the building sewer, but is otherwise accessible to the
POTW, the owner shall provide a private sewage pumping station as provided
in § 18-124(3).
18-24
(1) Non-availability certificate. A private sewage disposal system may
not be constructed within the town limit unless and until a certificate is
obtained from the superintendent stating that the POTW is not accessible to the
property and no such POTW is proposed for construction in the immediate
future. If the property is within reasonable distance of the POTW, connection
to the POTW is required. The superintendent shall determine the reasonable
distance of the POTW, connection to the POTW is required. The superintendent
shall determine the reasonable distance to the POTW but in no case shall the
reasonable distance be less than five hundred (500) feet for gravity flow or less
than three hundred (300) feet for a private sewage force main. No certificate
shall be issued for any private sewage disposal system employing subsurface soil
absorption facilities where the area of the lot is less than that specified by the
Town of Rogersville and the Hawkins County Health Department.
(2) Requirements. Any private sewage disposal system must be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of the State of Tennessee and
of the Hawkins County Health Department and the Town of Rogersville,
Tennessee, and must be inspected and approved by the authorized
representative of the Hawkins County Health Department and by the
superintendent. The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage
disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the town.
When the POTW becomes available, the building sewer shall be connected to
such POTW within sixty (60) days of the date of availability, and the private
sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with suitable
material.
No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with
any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Hawkins County
Health Department. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-122. Regulation of holding tank waste disposal. (1) Septic tanks.
No person owning vacuum or "septic tank" pump trucks or other liquid waste
transport trucks shall discharge directly or indirectly such sewage into the
POTW, unless such person shall first have applied for and received a truck
discharge operation permit from the superintendent. All applicants for a truck
discharge operation permit shall complete such forms as required by the
superintendent, pay appropriate fees, and agree in writing to abide by the
provisions of this section and any special conditions or regulations established
by the superintendent. Such permits shall be valid for a period of one (1) year
from date of issuance, provided that such permit shall be subject to revocation
by the superintendent for violation of any provision of this section or reasonable
regulation established by the superintendent. Such permits shall be limited to
the discharge of domestic sewage waste containing no industrial waste.
(2) Other holding tank waste. No person shall discharge any other
holding tank waste into the POTW unless he shall have applied for and have
been issued a permit by the superintendent. Unless otherwise allowed under
the terms and conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for
18-25
each separate discharge. The permit shall state the specific location of the
discharge, the time of day the discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge,
and shall limit the wastewater constituents and characteristics of the discharge.
Such user shall pay any applicable charges or fees thereof, and shall comply
with the conditions of the permit issued by the superintendent and the Solid
Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901, et seq.). Provided, however, no permit will
be required to discharge domestic waste from a recreational vehicle holding tank
provided such discharge is made into an approved facility designed to receive
such waste.
(3) Fees. For each permit issued under the provisions of this chapter,
an annual service charge shall be paid to the town to be set as specified in
§ 18-113. Any such permit granted shall be for one (1) full fiscal year or fraction
of the fiscal year, and shall continue in full force and effect from the time issued
until the ending of the fiscal year unless sooner revoked, and shall be nontransferable.
The number of the permit granted hereunder shall be plainly
painted on each side of each motor vehicle used in the conduct of the business
permitted hereunder. All users discharging septic tank or holding tank wastes
to the POTW shall pay appropriate fees to be established as specified in
§ 18-113.
(4) Designated disposal location(s). The superintendent shall
designate approved location(s) for the emptying and cleansing of all equipment
used in the performance of the services rendered under the permit herein
provided for, and it shall be a violation hereof for any person, firm, association
or corporation to empty or clean such equipment at any place other than a place
so designated. The superintendent may refuse to accept any truckload of waste
at his absolute discretion where it appears that the waste could interfere with
the effective operation of the POTW.
(5) Revocation of permit. Failure to comply with all the provisions of
this chapter shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of such permit by the
superintendent. The possession within the service area by any person of any
motor vehicle equipped with a body type and accessories of a nature and design
capable of serving a septic tank of wastewater or excreta disposal system
cleaning unit shall be prima facie evidence that such person is engaged in the
business of cleaning, draining, or flushing septic tanks or other wastewater or
excreta disposal systems within the service area of the Town of Rogersville.
(Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-123. Wastewater pretreatment devices for commercial or
industrial users. (1) Requirement for devices. Grease, oil, sand trap collectors
or separators shall be installed and maintained when they are necessary for the
proper handling of harmful substances. Such separators shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Town of Rogersville and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning, pumping and inspection.
Commercial sources in operation prior to July 1, 1996 are excluded from
the minimum requirements of this chapter, but will be required to install and
18-26
maintain a gravity-type separator, interceptor or other such device on the
kitchen sink for the removal of oil and grease. These devices shall be the largest
type available that will fit under the sink and shall not be connected to any
dishwashers. These devices will be allowed to remain in service until such time
the Town of Rogersville determines the device is not preventing regulated
substances from entering the town's sewer system or the device is not being
adequately maintained. Upon this determination, the town will require the
establishment to install the minimum size device as outlined under subsection
(3) of this section.
It shall be the duty of every establishment required to have such devices,
to maintain the device and to have same pumped whenever the level of grease
or other substance has reached the top of the effluent pipe from the device, or
when it appears to the town or its representative that said grease, oil, or other
substances are leaving the aforementioned device and are being introduced into
the town's sewer system.
New commercial or industrial dischargers of wastewater into the Town
of Rogersville wastewater collection system are required by this chapter to
install and maintain a gravity-type separator, interceptor, or other such device
for the removal of oil, grease, sand, grit, entrails, or other such material likely
to create or contribute to a blockage of the wastewater collection system or
otherwise interfere with the operation of the sanitary sewer system or the
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) unless such establishments are
specifically excluded from this requirement.
New or existing commercial establishments which are generally not
required to install pretreatment devices unless specifically required include, but
are not limited to:
(a) Commercial establishments which are not involved in food
processing, preparation, packaging, or handling; or
(b) Commercial establishments with food preparation, but no
deep fryer, or grill.
Although these establishments are initially excluded from the
pretreatment device requirement, if it is determined that these businesses are
causing sewer line stoppages due to grease or other problems, then pretreatment
devices will be required.
If a new or existing commercial establishment plans to add a deep fryer
or a grill, that establishment must notify the town prior to installation and
submit plans as specified in subsection (3) of this section.
Every establishment with a separation device is required to maintain a
maintenance log on all such devices. The log will show the date of all cleanings
and who performed the cleaning. Disposition of removed substances is to be
recorded. The maintenance log will be provided by the town and shall be
available for examination by the town or its representative at any time and shall
be submitted annually to the town between May 1 through the 31 each year.
Failure to carry out this reporting procedure is a violation of this chapter and
18-27
the town may institute enforcement action under § 18-125 and penalties under
§ 18-126 of this chapter.
(2) Inspection. Each commercial or industrial user required to own
and maintain such pretreatment devices will be inspected at least once each
year. Maintenance records shall be kept and shall be available for review by the
town's personnel during inspections.
Town of Rogersville personnel shall be permitted ready access to inspect
devices for compliance. If found in violation, the user will be issued a seven (7)
day notice to come into compliance. Failure to correct the noncompliance within
the seven (7) day period will result in the termination of water service under
§ 18-125--Enforcement of this chapter. If the severing of water service will
possibly result in a threat to public health, then the grease trap will be pumped
and cleaned by Town of Rogersville personnel. The user will be responsible for
all labor, equipment, and disposal charges incurred by the town. These charges
will be added to the user's utility bill.
(3) Submittals and design. Prior to installation of new gravity-type
separators, grease traps, screens, or other pretreatment devices, plans and
design calculations shall be submitted to Town of Rogersville personnel for
review and approval. No specifications for pretreatment devices are detailed in
these regulations except for grease traps and grit separators. Grease trap
specifications are outlined on Drawing Number GR-1 at the end of this chapter
and in this subsection of this section. Grit separator specifications for car wash
operations are outlined on drawing No. GR-2 at the end of this chapter and in
this subsection. Town of Rogersville personnel will evaluate separately the
materials and criteria proposed for use in the design of other pretreatment
devices.
All grease traps are to meet design criteria as outlined in this section.
Person(s) wishing to install pre-cast concrete septic tanks or concrete tanks
must submit to the town a design drawing. A field inspection shall be required
to ensure that the installation complies with the approved drawings and that
adequate baffling has been installed in the device.
During the site plan review conducted by Town of Rogersville personnel
of proposed commercial and industrial developments, the need for a grease trap
or other pretreatment devices will be determined. If a grease trap or other
pretreatment device is required, then detailed plumbing plans shall be
submitted to the town prior to commencement of construction.
Grease trap sizes will be determined by the following formula:
Grease Trap Size (gallons) =
F.U. x 0.5 x 5 gpm x 20 minutes
Where F. U. = fixture units plumbed into the grease trap
(fixture unit values as listed in the Southern
Building Code)
18-28
gpm = gallons/minute
(4) Private waste disposal. Acceptable disposal options for the wastes
removed from these devices includes recycling collectors, trash disposal, or
commercial collectors. These options are contingent on the regulations of
landfills where the waste is disposed.
(5) Fees. Users required to install and maintain a gravity-type
separator, interceptor, or other such device will be subject to an annual fee.
These fees are outlined in § 18-113, as passed and amended from time to time
by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen of the Town of Rogersville. All fees will
appear on the user's utility bill. In the event the user chooses not to pay said
fees, water service will be terminated until such time fees and any other late
charges have been paid.
Any person(s) including, but not limited to, commercial users who
willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter or any orders or
permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine as outlined in § 18-126 of this chapter. (Ord. #2-11-97-2,
April 1997)
18-124. Building sewers and connections. (1) Building sewer permit.
No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening
into, use, alter or disturb any POTW or appurtenances thereof without first
obtaining a written building sewer permit from the water superintendent.
Any residential and commercial user discharging only domestic wastes
shall make application for a building sewer permit furnished by the town. The
permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the water superintendent.
(2) Connections. All costs and expense incident to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the town from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Connection to the POTW
shall be made only by the Town of Rogersville or its duly authorized agent. The
sewer connection and all building sewers, from the building to the POTW, shall
be inspected by the water superintendent before the underground portion is
covered.
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where a building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot
and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building
through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the building sewer from the
front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered
as one building sewer.
(3) Installation. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the water
superintendent, to meet all requirements of this chapter. All others shall be
sealed to the specifications of the water superintendent.
18-29
Building sewers shall be at least four (4) inches in diameter. Larger
building sewers shall be used as necessary in order to carry the flow anticipated.
Four (4) inch building sewers shall be laid on a grade of at least one (1) percent.
Larger building sewers shall be laid on a grade that will produce a velocity when
flowing full of at least two (2) feet per second. Slope and alignment of all
building sewers shall be neat and regular. Pipe materials as specified below
shall be used. Pipe shall conform to the appropriate ASTM specification and
shall be laid in conformation with the appropriate ASTM specification of the
WEF Manual of Practice, No. 9.
Building sewers shall be constructed only of:
(a) Concrete or clay sewer pipe using rubber compression joints
of approved type;
(b) Cast-iron soil pipe using rubber compression joints of
approved type;
(c) Polyvinyl-chloride pipe with rubber compression joints;
(d) ABS composite sewer pipe with solvent welded or rubber
compression joints of approved type; or
(e) Such other materials of equal or superior quality as may be
approved by the water superintendent.
Under no circumstances will cement mortar joints be acceptable. Each
connection to the POTW must be made at a wye, or service line stubbed out, or
in the absence of any other provision, by means of a saddle of a type approved
by the water superintendent attached to the sewer. No connection may be made
by breaking into an existing sewer and inserting the service line.
The building sewer may be brought into the building below the basement
floor when gravity flow from the building to the POTW is at a grade of one (1)
percent or more if possible. In cases where basement or floor levels are lower
than the ground elevation at the point of connection to the POTW, adequate
precautions by installation of check valves or other backflow prevention devices,
to protect against flooding shall be provided by the owner. In all buildings in
which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the POTW, wastes
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building at the expense of the owner.
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly
to the POTW.
The connection of the building sewer into the POTW shall conform to the
rules and regulations the town may establish and the procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WEF Manual of Practice, No. 9.
All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from
the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the water
superintendent before installation.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the water
superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
18-30
to the POTW. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the water
superintendent or his representative.
All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the town.
Each individual property owner or user of the POTW shall be entirely
responsible for the maintenance of the building sewer located on private
property. This maintenance shall include repair or replacement of the service
line as deemed necessary by the water superintendent to meet specifications of
the town. (Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-125. Enforcement. (1) Harmful contributions. The town may
suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the town, in order
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to
the environment, causes interference or pass-through at the POTW, or causes
the town to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the town shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The town
shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge.
A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence
shall be submitted to the town within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.
(2) Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following
conditions of this chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject
to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this section:
(a) Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharger;
(b) Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(c) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
(d) Violation of conditions of the permit.
(3) Notification of violation. Whenever the town finds that any user
has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater contribution permit, or any
prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, the town may serve
upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within
thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction
18-31
thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after
this notice of violation is issued.
(4) Administrative orders. If the user fails to correct a violation within
thirty (30) days of receiving notice of violation, the control authority shall issue
the administrative order for the correction of this violation; provided however,
that the user is not relieved of responsibility for unauthorized discharges which
occur within the thirty (30) day interval.
(5) Cease and desist order. When the town finds that a discharge of
wastewater has taken place, in violation of prohibitions or limitations of this
chapter or the provisions of a wastewater discharge permit, the town may issue
an order to cease and desist, and direct the user to comply forthwith within a
specified time schedule, or to take appropriate remedial or preventative action
in the event of a threatened violation.
(6) Fines and penalties. Any user who violates or fails to comply with
any of the provisions of the this chapter and/or industrial user discharge permit
issued by the town shall be liable for an administrative fine of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day as authorized by Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 69-3-115 for each violation. The town shall have the power to
impose such fines and penalties.
(7) Show cause hearing. (a) The town may order any user who causes
or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW or contributes to
violation of this chapter or wastewater permit to show cause before the
town why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to
be held by the town regarding the violation, the reasons why the action
is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to
show cause before the town why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10)
days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of
a corporation. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as
noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
(b) The board of mayor and aldermen may itself conduct the
hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or
any officer or employee of the Town of Rogersville to:
(i) Issue in the name of the board of mayor and aldermen
notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of
witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter
involved in such hearings;
(ii) Take the evidence;
(iii) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing,
including transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the board of mayor and aldermen for action
thereon.
18-32
(c) After the town has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have
been installed on existing treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as
are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
(8) Unacceptable wastes. Waters or wastes that are otherwise
5 acceptable for discharge to sanitary sewers, but which have a BOD in excess of
three hundred (300) milligrams per liter, a COD in excess of six hundred (600)
milligrams per liter, a total kjeldahl nitrogen content in excess of sixty (60)
milligrams per liter, an ammonia nitrogen content in excess of thirty (30)
milligrams per liter, a suspended solids content in excess of three hundred (300)
milligrams per liter, a total dissolved solids content in excess of three thousand
(3,000) milligrams per liter, or an ether soluble matter (oil and grease) content
in excess of seventy (70) milligrams per liter, or any constituent found in
violation of those specific pollutant limitations shown in § 18-107 of this chapter,
shall be subject to a surcharge based on the actual considerations as compared
to normal sanitary sewage, such surcharge being necessary to compensate the
town for the extra cost of treating such wastes.
(9) Surcharge determination procedure. The surcharge(s) shall be
based on the analytical results on not less than three (3) twenty-four (24) hour
composite samples collected at the control manhole. Samples shall be collected
and analyses shall be made by competent operating personnel at the wastewater
treatment plant or other persons designated by the town in accordance with the
latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater."
5 (10) Surcharge rates. The surcharge on excessive BOD , COD, TKN,
3 NH -N, suspended solids, oil and grease, or any constituent found in § 18-107
of this chapter shall be determined by the following formula:
Surcharge Factor =
Actual Constituent Concentration -1
Constituent Concentration for "Normal Sewage" (see § 18-107)
The "surcharge factor" shall be multiple by the monthly charge for sewer
service to obtain the surcharge for that particular month.
The town may adjust or vary the various rates and/or formulas at its
discretion.
(11) Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes
or other wastes into the town's wastewater disposal system, in any other way
violates this chapter or its industrial wastewater discharge permit, contrary to
the provisions of this chapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or
any order of the town, the town attorney may commence an action for
18-33
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. #2-11-97-2, April 1997)
18-126. Penalty and costs. (1) Civil penalties. Any user who is found
to have violated an order of the board of mayor and aldermen or who willfully
or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the
orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be fined not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) as authorized by Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 69-3-115 for each offense. Each day of which a violation shall occur
or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the
penalties provided herein, the town may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, court reporters' fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate
suit at law against the person found to have violated this chapter or the orders,
rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder.
(2) Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this

CHAPTER 3
USER CHARGE SYSTEM
SECTION
18-301. General provisions.
18-302. Charge structure.
18-303. Rates.
18-301. General provisions. (1) Actual use. The user change system
(UCS) shall be based on actual use, or estimated use, of wastewater treatment
services. Each user or user class must pay their proportionate share of the costs
of wastewater treatment services based on the quantity and quality of their
discharge.
(2) Notifications. Each user shall be notified annually in conjunction
with their regular bill of the rate being charged for wastewater treatment
services.
(3) Financial management system. The UCS must establish a
financial management system that will accurately account for revenues
generated and expenditures of the wastewater system. This financial
management system shall be based on an adequate budget identifying the bases
for determining the annual operating expenses, interest expenses, interest
expense, depreciation (if appropriate), and any reserve account requirements.
(4) Charges for inflow and/or infiltration. The UCS shall provide that
the cost of operation and maintenance for all flow not directly attributable to
users be distributed among all users in the same manner that it distributes the
costs of the actual or estimated usage.
(5) Use of revenue. Revenue derived from a wastewater project funded
by a state revolving loan; including but not limited to, sale of treatment-relatedby-
products; lease of land; or sale of crops grown on land purchased shall offset
current user charges as well as moderate future rate increases.
(6) Other municipalities. If the wastewater system accepts
wastewater from other local governments, these subscribers receiving
wastewater treatment services shall adopt user charge systems in accordance
with the same state regulations, requiring this chapter.
(7) Inconsistent agreements. This UCS shall take precedence over the
terms or conditions of contracts between the town and users which are
inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. #6-11-91-1, Aug. 1991)
18-302. Charge structure. (1) Classification of users. Class 1: Those
users whose average biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is three hundred fifty
(350) milligrams per liter by weight or less, and whose suspended solids (SS)
discharge is three hundred fifty (350) milligrams per liter by weight or less.
(C1)
18-39
(2) Determination of costs. The governing body shall establish
monthly rates and charges for the use of the wastewater system and the service
supplied by the wastewater system. These charges shall be based upon the cost
categories described as operation, maintenance, and replacement (OMR);
interest (I); and, principal repayments or depreciation, whichever is greater (P).
(a) All users who fall under Class 1 shall pay a single unit
charge expressed as dollars per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water
purchased with the unit charge being determined by the following
formula: C1 = OMR + I + P/ Total gallons treated.
(b) All users who fall within Class 2 classification shall pay the
same base unit charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water
purchased as for the Class I users and in addition shall pay a surcharge
rate on the excessive amounts of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and
suspended solids (SS) in direct proportion to the actual discharge
quantities.
C2 = C1 plus the following formula for excessive strength:
(A (D-350) + B (E-350) X .00834 X G =
Surcharge Payment ($/Mo.)
The components of the formula are as follows:
A = Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound.
B = Surcharge rate of SS, $/pound.
C = Surcharge rate for other pollutant(s) in $/pound.
D = User's average BOD concentration, in mg/l.
E = User's average SS concentration, in mg/l.
F = User's average other pollutants concentration, in mg/l.
G = User's monthly flow to sewage works, per 1,000 gallons.
No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the
sewage works contain less than 350 mg/l of BOD of 350 mg/l.
(c) The volume of water purchased which is used in the
calculation of wastewater use charges may be adjusted by the Rogersville
Water Commission if a user does not discharge it to the public sewers (i.e.
filling swimming pools or industrial heating). The user shall be
responsible for documenting the quantity of wastewater actually
discharged to the public sewer. (Ord. #6-11-91-1, Aug. 1991)
18-40
Municipal code reference 1
Sewer charges and fees: § 18-113.
18-303. Rates. The Rogersville Water Commission will review the user 1
charges annually along with the budget process and revise the rates as
necessary to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to pay OMR, I, and
P. The periodic review shall also ensure that the system continues to provide
for the proportional distribution of these costs among users and user classes.

existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the Superintendent of the Water
Commission of the Rogersville Public Water System.
18-45
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-13-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
Rogersville Public Water System, shall be grounds for denial of water service.
If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the utility
shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be discontinued
and physically separate the public water supply from the customer's on-site
piping system in such a manner that the two systems cannot again be connected
by an unauthorized person.
Where cross connections, interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses
are found that constitutes an extreme hazard of immediate concern of
contaminating the public water system, the management of the water supply
shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat
to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the
public water system from the on-site piping system unless the imminent
hazard(s) is (are) corrected immediately. (Ord. #2-11-86-2, April 1986)

willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the water supply, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water
supply.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected.
The Superintendent of the Water Commission of the Rogersville Public
Water System or his designated representative, shall require the use of an
approved protective device on the service line serving the premises to assure
that any contamination that may originate in the customer's premises is
contained therein. The protective device shall be a reduced pressure zone type
backflow preventer approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation as to manufacture, model, and size. The method of installation of
backflow protective devices shall be approved by the Superintendent of the
Water Commission of the Rogersville Public Water System prior to installation
and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation. The installation shall be at the expense of the
owner or occupant of the premises.
Personnel of the Rogersville Public Water System shall have the right to
inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the superintendent of the water commission or his designated
18-46
representative. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the device without
the knowledge of the occupant of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and
the continuance of service is critical, the superintendent of the water
commission shall notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of plans to
discontinue water service and arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test
and/or repair the device. The water supply shall require the occupant of the
premises to make all repairs indicated promptly, to keep the unit(s) working
properly, and the expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner or
occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel
acceptable to the Superintendent of the Water Commission of the Rogersville
Public Water System.
The failure to maintain backflow prevention device(s) in proper working
order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises. Likewise,
the removal, bypassing, or altering of the protective device(s) or the installation
thereof so as to render the device(s) ineffective shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises shall not be
restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or
defects to the satisfaction of the Rogersville Public Water System.
(Ord. #2-11-86-2, April 1986)
18-411. Unpotable water to be labeled. That the potable water
system made available to the premises served by the public water system be
protected from possible contamination as specified herein. Any water outlet
which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied
by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one-inch high
located on a red background. (Ord. #2-11-86-2, April 1986)
18-412. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the Rogersville Public Water System whether located
inside or outside the corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the
conditions required to be met for the town to provide water services to any
premises. Such action, being essential for the protection of the water
distribution system against the entrance of contamination which may render the
water unsafe healthwise, or otherwise undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly
18-47
without regard to location of the premises, whether inside or outside the
Rogersville Corporate Limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
therefor, shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than fifty
dollars ($50.00), and each day of continued violation after conviction shall

(b) Water supply conditions (existing and forecasted), and
(c) Other relevant information.
(3) The water management advisory group shall consult with and

18-506. Shortage water rates (stand-by rates). (1) Upon the
declaration of a water shortage, the Town of Rogersville shall utilize shortage
water rates to water conservation of water supplies. Such rates may provide for,
but not be limited to:
(a) Higher charges per unit for increasing usage (increasing
block rates);
(b) Uniform charges for water usage per unit of use (uniform
unit rate);
(c) Extra charges for use in excess of a specified level (excess
demand surcharge); or
(d) Discounts for conserving water beyond specified levels.
(This ordinance includes an example of an "excess use or "surcharge"
structure.)
(2) In the event of a water shortage and activation of the "restrictions"
phase, the Town of Rogersville is hereby authorized to monitor water use and
limit households to seventy (70) gallons per household member per day.
Domestic water use above this limit will be subject to a surcharge of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons. The Town of Rogersville is
hereby authorized to monitor water use and limit households to forty (40)
gallons per household member per day under an "emergency" phase. Domestic
water use above this limit will be subject to a surcharge of fifty dollars ($50.00)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons. Institutional, commercial, industrial, and
recreational water users will be subject to water use surcharges of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water used if the Town of
Rogersville deems that adequate conservation measures have not been
implemented. (Ord. #8-9-88-2, Oct. 1988)
18-507. Rationing. In the event of a declared drought the Town of
Rogersville issues a declaration of water shortage specifying either a restrictions
phase or emergency phase the Town of Rogersville is hereby authorized to ration
water in accordance with the following conditions:
(1) Residential water customers and allotments. (a) The number of
permanent residents in each dwelling unit (household) will determine the
amount of water that each household will be allowed.
(b) Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted seventy (70)
gallons per day for each resident of the household under "restrictions"
and forty (40) gallons per day for each resident of the household under
18-53
"emergency" conditions. Households with only one permanent resident
will have a daily allotment of fifty-five (55) gallons per day under
"emergency" conditions.
(c) Residential water customers are required to provide city
utility personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary to
this rationing declaration. Where access is not readily available, all
reasonable efforts to contact customers in order to arrange for access to
read meters shall be made. In the event a water customer does not allow
entry to read the meter after reasonable efforts to arrange for such
access, the dwelling unit (household) allotment will be reduced to fiftyfive
(55) gallons per day.
(d) (i) Where the residential water allotment provided under
this section would create an "extraordinary hardship," as in the
case of special health-related requirements, the water customer
may apply to the water system for an exemption or variance from
these requirements. If it is found that the allotment provided in
this section would impose an extraordinary hardship, a revised
allotment for the particular customer may be established.
(ii) Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such
an exemption or variance rendered by the municipality rendering
water service, may file a complaint with the water management
advisory group. The complaint must be filed in writing in the
office of the city recorder. The WMAG shall render its opinion
within seven (7) days of the receipt of such written complaint by
the city recorder. The aggrieved person may request a hearing
before the WMAG. If such request is made in writing, the hearing
shall be held within seven (7) days of the date of the request, and
the opinion of the WMAG shall be rendered within three (3) days
of such hearing.
(2) Non-residential water customers and allotments. Non-residential
customers include commercial, industrial, institutional, pubic and all other such
users, with the exception of hospitals and health care facilities.
Non-residential water customers shall further reduce their water usage
to fifty (50) percent of use levels of April 19, 1988.
It is the primary responsibility of each non-residential water customer to
meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner possible.
The Town of Rogersville will establish a water allotment for each nonresidential
water customer, based upon a required further reduction of water
usage from the rate of water used by the customer in effect on April 1988, or the
last recorded use level if no meter readings record the rate of the customer's use
on April 1988.
Each non-residential water user shall provide access to water system
personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance with this
ordinance. All reasonable efforts will be made to contact customers to arrange
for access.
18-54
If the mandated further reduction in water usage cannot be obtained
without imposing extraordinary hardship which threatens health and safety, the
non-residential customer may apply to the water system for a variance. For
these purposes "extraordinary hardship" means a permanent damage to
property or economic loss which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices
borne by other water users subject to this water rationing ordinance. If the
further reduction would cause an extraordinary hardship or threaten health or
safety, a variance may be granted and a revised water use reduction
requirement for the particular customer may be established.
(3) Water use rationing for hospitals and health care facilities.
Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all restrictions imposed
on residential and non-residential water customers as may be applicable to each
individual institution, to the extent compliance will not endanger the health of
the patients or residents of the institution.
Each hospital or health care facility shall survey its water usage patterns
and requirements and implement such additional conservation measures as may
be possible without endangering the health of its patients or residents to achieve
a further reduction in the institution's water usage. (Ord. #8-9-88-2, Oct. 1988)
18-508. Fines and penalties. Except as otherwise stated herein,
violators of any provision of this ordinance shall be penalized. The penalty for
a person's first offense shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The penalty for a
person's second offense shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). Persons violating this
ordinance a third or more times within the same drought period will have water
service disconnected for a period of five (5) days with a three hundred dollar
($300.00) reconnection fee.
The aforementioned fines and penalties may be in lieu of, or in addition
to, any other penalty provided by law.
Services disconnected under such circumstances shall be restored only
upon payment of a reconnection charge. (Ord. #8-9-88-2, Oct. 1988)
18-509. Monitoring and enforcement. Law officers of the Town of
Rogersville police force shall, in addition to duties imposed by law, diligently
enforce the provisions of this ordinance.

Department, and Fire Department have the duty, and are hereby authorized to
enforce the provisions of this ordinance and shall have the power and authority
to issue citations when violations of this ordinance occur during any declared
drought. (Ord. #8-9-88-2, Oct. 1988)
18-510. Variances. (1) Customers not capable of reducing water use
immediately, because of equipment damage or other extreme circumstances,
shall reduce water use within twenty-four (24) hours of a declaration of a water
shortage, where provisions of this ordinance apply to them and shall apply for
a variance from curtailment.
18-55
(2) Customers requesting exemption from the provisions of this
ordinance shall file a petition for variance with the WMAG within three (3) days
after such curtailment becomes effective.
(3) When the ordinance has been invoked by the WMAG, all petitions
for variances shall be reviewed by the WMAG. When the ordinance has been
invoked by the WMAG, persons using less than twenty five thousand (25,000)
gallons of water per day shall file a petition for variance with the WMAG, and
persons using in excess of twenty-five thousand (25,000)gallons of water per day
shall file a petition for variance with the WMAG within three (3) days of the
effective date of water use curtailment or reduction. The WMAG shall respond
to requests for variance within five (5) days of receipt of information or within
twenty (20) days of declarations of the curtailment, whichever comes first.
Petitions shall contain the following:
(a) Name and address of the petitioner(s);
(b) Purpose of water use;
(c) Specific provisions from which the petitioner is requesting
relief;
(d) Detailed statement as to how the declaration adversely

accomplished during the duration of the water shortage.
(b) Alternative methods can be implemented which will achieve
the same level of reduction in water use.
(c) An extraordinary hardship can be shown.
(5) The Town of Rogersville may, in writing, grant temporary
variances for existing water uses otherwise prohibited under the ordinance if it
is a condition adversely affecting health, sanitation, or fire protection for the
public or the petitioner and if one or more of the aforementioned conditions is
met. The governing body of the Town of Rogersville shall ratify or revoke any
such variance at their next scheduled meeting. Any such variance so ratified
may be revoked by later action of the governing body of the Town of Rogersville.
(6) No variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation
of this ordinance occurring prior to the issuance of the variance.
18-56
(7) Variances granted by WMAG shall be subject to the following
conditions, unless waived or modified by WMAG.
(a) Variances granted shall include a timetable for compliance.
(b) Variances granted shall expire when the water shortage no
longer exists. (Ord. #8-9-88-2, Oct. 1988)

(1) Declaration of a drought. Whenever the Town of Rogersville finds
that a potential shortage of water supply is indicated, it shall be empowered to
declare a drought exists, and that the water superintendent shall, daily, monitor
the supply and demands upon that supply. In addition, the mayor (or his/her
agent) is authorized to specify the management phase in effect and the
measures to be employed by the system's customers. This declaration shall be

Section A. Statutory authorization
The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in sections 13-7-201 through
13-7-210, Tennessee Code Annotated delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Rogersville,
Tennessee Board of Mayor and Aldermen does ordain as follows:
Section B. Findings of fact
1. The Rogersville Mayor and Commission wishes to establish eligibility in
the National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet
the requirements of 60.3(b) of the Federal Insurance Administration
Regulations found at 44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-88 edition) and subsequent
amendments.
2. Areas of Rogersville are subject to periodic inundation which could result
in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and by uses
in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction
which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
Section C. Statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas. This ordinance is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion
hazards, or which cause in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights,
or velocities;
A-58
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be
protected against flood damage;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage, and;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards.
Section D. Objectives
The objectives of this ordinance are:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located
in floodable areas;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a floodable
area; and
8. To establish eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.

ARTICLE 4. ADMINISTRATION
Section A. Designation of building inspector
The building inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement the
provisions of this ordinance.
Section B. Permit procedures
Application for a development permit shall be made to the building inspector on
forms furnished by him prior to any development activity. The development
permit may include, but is not limited to the following: plans in duplicate drawn
to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or
equipment, drainage facilities. Specifically the following information is
required:
1. Application stage
a. Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor
(including basement) of all buildings.*
b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential
building will be flood-proofed, where base flood
elevation is available.*
c. Certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that
the non-residential flood-proofed building will meet the floodproofing
criteria in Article 4. Section B.2, where base flood
elevation data is available.*
d. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
*(see 2. below)
2. Construction stage
Within unnumbered A zones, where flood elevation data are not
available, building inspector shall record the elevation of the lowest floor
on the development permit. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be
determined as the measurement of the lowest floor of the building and
the highest adjacent grade. USGS Quadrangle maps may be utilized
when no more detailed references exists to establish reference elevations.
A-71
Within all flood zones where base flood elevation data are utilized, the
building inspector shall require that upon placement of the lowest floor,
or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, whichever is
applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
building inspector a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, or
flood-proofed elevation, whichever is applicable, as built in relation to
mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by, or under the
direct supervision of, a registered land surveyor, professional engineer,
or architect and certified by same. When flood-proofing is utilized for a
particular building, said certification shall be prepared by, or under the
direct supervision of, a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall
be prepared by, or under the direct supervision of, a professional engineer
or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to
submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The
building inspector shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit
holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted
to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said
corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for
the project.
Section C. Duties and responsibilities of the building inspector
Duties of the building inspector shall include, but not be limited to:
1. Review of all development permits to assure that the requirements of this
ordinance have been satisfied, and that proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding.
2. Advice to permittee that additional federal or state permits may be
required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are know,
require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the development permit. This shall include Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U. S. C.
1334.
3. Notification to adjacent communities and the Tennessee Department of
Economic and Community Development, Local Planning Office, prior to
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submission of evidence
of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
4. Record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level or highest
adjacent grade, whichever is applicable) of the lowest floor (including
A-72
basement) of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance
with Article 4. Section B.2.
5. Record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level or highest
adjacent grade, whichever is applicable) to which the new or substantially
improved buildings have been flood-proofed, in accordance with Article
4. Section B.2.
6. When flood-proofing is utilized, the building inspector shall obtain
certification from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with Article 4. Section B.2.
7. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be
a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the
building inspector shall make the necessary interpretation. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article 6.
8. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the building official
shall obtain, review and reasonably utilized any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including
data developed as a result of these regulations, as criteria for requiring
that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
in Zone A on the Community FHBM or FIRM meet the requirements of
this chapter.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not been
established and where alternative data is not available, the building
official shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or
floodproofed to a level of at least (2) two feet above the highest adjacent
grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in Article 2
of this ordinance). All applicable data including the highest adjacent
grade elevation and the elevations of the lowest floor of flood-proofing
shall be recorded as set forth in Article 4. Section B.
9. All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance shall be

(1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
A-78
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be
elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with
Article 5. Section B.
Section D. Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section
B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1' - 3') where
a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above

buildings shall:
a. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the
lowest floor, including basement shall be elevated at least two (2)
feet above the highest adjacent grade; or,
b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed to or above that level so that any space
below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Section E. Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3. Section
B. are areas of the 100-year flood protected by a flood protection system which
A-79
is under construction but where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors
have not been determined. With these areas (A-99 zones) the following
provisions apply:
1. All provisions of Article 4. And Article 5. Section A. and G. shall apply.
Section F. Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base
flood elevation and with floodways designated
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3. Section
B, where streams exist with base flood data and floodways provided, the
following provisions shall apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new construction, substantial
improvements or other developments shall be located within designated
floodways, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
encroachments or new development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to
standard hydraulic engineering principles.
2. If Article 5. Section F.1. above is satisfied, new construction or
substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed
to elevations established in accordance with Article 5. Section B.
Section G. Standards for unmapped streams
Located within Rogersville, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of
special flood hazard are neither indicated nor base flood data or floodways have
been provided. Adjacent to such streams the following provisions shall apply:
1. In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments including
fill material or structures shall be located within an area of at least equal
to twice the width of the stream along each side of the stream, unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point within the locality.
A-80
2. When flood elevation data is available, new construction or substantial
improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations
established in accordance with Article 4. Section B.2.
Section C. Standards for subdivision proposals
Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be reviewed to determine
whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision
proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such
proposals shall be reviewed to ensure that:
1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.

apply exclusively to areas of special flood hazard.
Section A. Board of zoning appeals
1. The Rogersville board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair
or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation
as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
3. In passing upon such applications, the board of zoning appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
A-81
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the
injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of
a functionally dependent facility;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
h. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
i. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site, and;
j. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.
4. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this
ordinance, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of
this ordinance.
5. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Section B. Conditions for variances
1. Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variances is the
minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the
A-82
instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the
minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and
design of the building.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient
cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, on conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and
that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property.
4. The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency
upon request.
