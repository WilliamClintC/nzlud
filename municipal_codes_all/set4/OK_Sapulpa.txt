PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sapulpa, Oklahoma. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the City Code, as updated through June 17, 2019. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the Sapulpa Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as updated. 
The Code has been arranged into parts, chapters, and sections. The various sections within each part have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this republication. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the republication, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 
Index or Indexes 
The index (indexes) has (have) been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself (indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

The holder of any elective office may be removed for just cause at any time by the electors qualified to vote for the successor of such incumbent.

The procedure to effect the removal of an incumbent of an elective office shall be as follows: Petitions filed by the electors entitled to vote for a successor to the incumbent sought to be removed, equal in number to at least twenty-five (25) percent of the registered voters of the ward of the Councilor or Councilors to be recalled, shall be filed with the City Clerk, who shall immediately refer it to the Board of Councilors, which board shall within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, examine and pass upon the sufficiency of said petition; provided further, the said petition shall contain a specific statement of the act or acts complained of in concise language, give a detailed description including the approximate date, location, and nature of each act complained of, signed by the person or persons making the charge, give their respective residence addresses, and be verified under oath that the person or persons believe the charge or charges to be true and have knowledge of the alleged facts upon which the stated grounds for recall are based. The signatures to the petitions need not be appended to on paper, but each signer shall show his place of residence, and his qualifications to vote at such election and that he is familiar with the contents of the petition. The person circulating each such paper shall make an oath before an officer, competent to administer oaths, that the statements therein made are true and that each signature to the petition appended is a genuine signature of the person whose name purports to be thereunto subscribed, and the same circulated and signed within sixty (60) days. 
(Amended, effective 2014)  
Sec. 2. - Sufficiency of petition. 
If the petition is found insufficient it shall be returned to the person filing the petition with a statement of the present reasons for such return, but without prejudice to the filing of new or amended petitions within ten (10) days to the same effect; if the petition or amended petition shall be found sufficient, the Board of Councilors, by resolution or ordinance, shall order and fix a date for a recall election, which shall be held at the earliest date permitted under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. There shall be no primary election. The recall election shall be an election to fill the office or offices held by the incumbent or incumbents sought to be recalled. Any qualified person including the incumbent(s) may file for the office or offices. The candidate(s) receiving the greatest number of votes for the office or offices in the recall election shall be elected. If at such election some other person than the incumbent(s) shall receive the highest number of votes, the incumbent(s) shall thereupon be deemed removed from office and shall vacate the office after the said election is certified to the City; otherwise the incumbent(s) shall remain in office. The successor of any officer removed shall hold office during the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any person sought to be removed may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless requested not to do so by the incumbent, the City Clerk shall place his name on the official ballot without nomination.

During the time of the epidemic, all dogs and cats within the City shall be confined on the premises of the owners or kept under leash as herein defined. The existence of an unusual number of rabid dogs and cats in the City shall be deemed an epidemic of rabies under this chapter, and the finding as to an epidemic of rabies by the Director shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.  
Sec. 4-107. - Rabies suspect. 
Any rabies-suspected animal shall be securely and separately confined for observation for a period of ten (10) days. The confinement and observation shall be at the Sapulpa Animal Shelter or, at the discretion of the owner, the animal may be confined in a veterinary hospital at the owner's expense. Boarding kennels shall not be considered proper confinement facilities. The owner must immediately surrender the rabies-suspect animal to the Chief of Police or his designee. In the event the owner wishes to have the animal held for observation at a veterinary hospital, the animal will be transported to the veterinary hospital of the owner's choice (provided the hospital is within the City limits of the City) by a representative of the City animal shelter. Any person failing to surrender a rabies-suspect animal, or any person removing the rabies-suspect animal from the City limits, is guilty of an offense. If, upon examination by a veterinarian, the animal has no signs of rabies at the end of the impoundment period, it may be released to the owner or, in case of a stray, it shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable law. In either event, the veterinarian shall make a written report of the disposition of the animal to the Chief of Police and the Director. At the end of the ten (10) day observation period, the Chief of Police shall notify any person bitten by a rabies-suspect animal whether such animal exhibited symptoms or indications of rabies; such notice shall be in the same manner as provided for service of notice under Section 4-109 of this chapter. 
Dogs owned and used by the Police Department that bit a person during the course of duty, shall be under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The type and amount of supervision is left to the professional opinion of the supervising veterinarian who assumes responsibility for the biting animal. 
The veterinarian must regularly examine the biting animal and immediately report any changes in condition of the animal to the City-County Health Department. 
The dog must be under the control of an authorized agent of the Police Department or the veterinarian at all times during the observation period. 
The owner of any non-immunized domestic animal other than a dog or cat which has been exposed to a rabid animal shall immediately report with such domestic animal to the Director for instruction concerning the disposition of that animal. 
Any effectively immunized domestic animal which is exposed to a rabid animal shall be immediately re-immunized and restrained by leashing and/or confined on the premises of its owner or in a veterinary hospital for a period of forty-five (45) days.  
Sec. 4-108. - Vicious animal. 
It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police and/or Director to investigate any proper claim that an animal is vicious within the meaning of this chapter. Should the investigating official determine that a vicious animal poses an immediate threat to the public health or safety, he shall immediately seize and impound the animal, or otherwise seek an order from the court that the animal be impounded. The Chief of Police shall also refer the matter to the City Attorney for approval of a verified complaint requesting a finding by the court that the impounded animal is vicious and aid in the proceedings instituted in the Municipal Criminal Court against any person for harboring a vicious animal. 
If the court shall fail to find, upon a preponderance of the evidence presented in an evidentiary hearing, that the animal seized and impounded is a vicious animal, then the court shall order the Chief of Police to return the animal to its owner. If such animal is found by the court to be a vicious animal, the court shall order the Chief of Police to euthanize the animal. 
At the option of the owner, but subject to the approval of the Chief of Police, an animal impounded pursuant to this section may be confined in a private kennel or veterinary clinic during the pendency of the vicious animal action. The operators of the facility shall then assume full liability for the confinement and maintenance of such animal and shall not release it without first being authorized by the Chief of Police or the court. All fees for such impoundment shall be the responsibility of the owner. In no event shall the City be liable for costs or fees charged by the private facility. Further, the City may assess to the owner the cost of transporting the animal to the privately-operated impoundment facility.  
Sec. 4-109. - Animal nuisance. 
It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police and/or Director to investigate any proper claim that an animal is a nuisance within the meaning of this chapter. Should the investigating official determine that a nuisance exists and it is necessary to abate the nuisance or should the official have reason to believe a threat to public health or safety exists, he shall refer the matter to the City Attorney for approval of a verified complaint and an order from the court that the animal be impounded. Following the filing of such verified complaint and an evidentiary hearing, if the court finds upon a preponderance of the evidence that a nuisance existed, the court may order the animal euthanized as in the case of a vicious animal. 
In lieu of order to have the animal euthanized, the court shall, at the request of the owner, require that the owner abate and prevent such nuisance and give a good and sufficient bond within three (3) days, in an amount not greater than the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00), satisfactory for a period not exceeding one (1) year. In this event, the court may order the return of such animal to the owner. However, during the pendency of such bond, upon a finding of the court that the nuisance has recurred, the court shall order the animal be impounded, euthanized and the owner's bond forfeited. If the court shall find that no nuisance existed, the court shall order the animal be surrendered to the owner. 
At the option of the owner, but subject to the approval of the Chief of Police, an animal impounded pursuant to this section may be confined in a private kennel or veterinary clinic during the pendency of the nuisance action. The operators of the facility shall then assume full liability for the confinement and maintenance of such animal and shall not release it without first being authorized by the Chief of Police or the court. All fees for such impoundment will be the responsibility of the owner. In no event will the City be liable for costs or fees charged by the private facility. Further, the City may assess to the owner the cost of transporting the animal to the privately operated impoundment facility. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the release from impoundment of any animal not properly licensed and vaccinated, or a threat to public health or safety.  
Sec. 4-110. - Notice of impoundment; reclaiming; disposal of animals; and fees. 
A.  When the owner of the animal is known, they shall be notified of the impoundment.

Provided, however, no fees shall be charged for any licensed animal surrendered to the owner on acquittal or dismissal of charges of keeping, possessing, owning or harboring such animal as a nuisance or as a vicious animal. Provided, further, no person shall be entitled to reclaim any animal found to be a nuisance, rabid, rabies-suspected, or vicious, except as provided herein.

A.  Permit and certificate of registration required. 
1.  It is unlawful for a person to own, harbor, or possess a dangerous dog without a permit and certificate of registration being issued to the owner of the dog by the City Clerk according to this chapter. This permit and certification requirement shall not apply to dogs used by law enforcement officials for police work. 
2.  The owner of a dangerous dog for which a permit and certificate of registration is required shall, prior to bringing or allowing the dog to be within City limits, apply to the City Clerk, or his or her designee, for a permit and registration certificate for each dangerous dog owned by him or her. The Clerk or designated representative shall issue a permit and certificate of registration to the owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence of compliance with Section 4-119 to the Chief of Police, or his designee. 
3.  All unregistered dangerous dogs within the City are deemed illegal animals. The person harboring or keeping an unregistered dangerous dog shall either register the dog with the City Clerk or have the animal removed from the City; and if any unregistered dangerous dog is found again unregistered in the City, the dog shall be destroyed. This section shall not apply to a dog which, upon initial notice, the owner agrees to properly register and confine the dog, or to a dog for which a hearing has been requested under this chapter to determine if it is a dangerous dog under the Code. 
4.  In addition to all other fees authorized to be assessed, the Animal Control Department may assess, and the owner or custodian of the dog must pay, the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for issuance of the permit allowing possession of a dangerous dog in the City. The permit shall be for a one (1) year period and may be renewed for additional one (1) year periods upon payment of the twenty-five dollars ($25.00) fee and compliance with other requirements of this section. 
B.  Confinement of dangerous dogs. 
1.  All dangerous dogs shall be securely confined within an occupied house or residence or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or kennel, except when leashed as provided in this section. No dangerous dog may be kept on a porch, patio, or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog to exit such structure of its own volition. 
2.  All pens, kennels, or other structures designed or used to confine dangerous dogs must have secure sides and a secure top attached to the sides or, in lieu of a top, walls at least six (6) feet in height and at least six (6) feet taller than any internal structure within the enclosed structure. If the pen or structure has no bottom secured to the sides, the ground beneath the gate shall be secured by imbedded posts and the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than two (2) feet so as to prevent digging under the walls by the confined dog, unless such pen has a concrete bottom, in which case the sides need only be embedded two (2) inches deep into the concrete. 
3.  All such pens or structures must be adequately lighted and ventilated and kept in a clean and sanitary condition. Any stationary pen or enclosure shall be required to be of a size at least two (2) square feet per pound of the dog so confined. Square feet per pound should be judged by the type of dog at average full-grown weight. 
4.  No person shall permit or allow a dangerous dog to go unconfined (outside its house, pen, kennel, or structure) unless such dog is securely muzzled and restrained by a chain or leash no longer than six (6) feet in length. The muzzle shall not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration but shall be made in a manner sufficient to prevent the dog from biting any human or other animal. No person shall permit or allow a dangerous dog to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash outside its kennel, pen, or other structure unless both the dog and leash are under the actual physical control of a person eighteen (18) years of age or older. Dangerous dogs may not be leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings, or any other object or structure. 
5.  The owner or person in control of a dangerous dog shall display in a prominent place on his or her premises a clearly visible warning sign indicating that there is a dangerous dog on the premises. A similar sign is required to be posted on each side of the pen, enclosure or kennel of the dog. 
C.  Confiscation of dangerous dogs. Any dangerous dog shall be immediately confiscated by the Animal Control Department if the dog is not validly registered as required by Section 4-119, or the dog is not confined or maintained in a proper enclosure required by Section 4-119, or the dog is outside of the dwelling of the owner or outside the proper enclosure and not muzzled and under physical restraint of a responsible person as required by Section 4-119. 
Any dangerous dog confiscated pursuant to this section and not reclaimed by its owner within five (5) days from the date of confiscation shall be deemed abandoned and, at the discretion of the Chief of Police, or his designee, humanely destroyed. Any dangerous dog which is found more than twice in any calendar year not to be confined as required by this chapter shall be, at the discretion of the Chief of Police, or his designee, permanently removed from the City or humanely destroyed. 
D.  Animal Control declaration of dangerous dog. If the Department of Animal Control has cause to believe a dog is dangerous, the department may find and declare such a dog to be a dangerous dog and the animal shall be immediately released and surrendered by the owner or custodian thereof to the Animal Control Department until a permit for the animal is obtained or an appeal filed by the owner as provided for herein. 
Dogs shall not be declared dangerous if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or has, in the past, been observed or reported to have tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. The owner shall have five (5) days from delivery of the notice that a dog is deemed dangerous to comply with the provisions of this chapter by removing the dog from the City limits, taking the prescribed measures to obtain a permit for the dog to remain in the City, or to dispute the finding by filing a written appeal with the office of the municipal court clerk within five (5) days of the declaration notice, which action shall be heard on the Court's next available docket. 
Upon conclusion of a hearing, the Judge is authorized to enter a finding on the matter and if finding that the dog is a dangerous dog, may order: 
1.  The payment of court costs and fines in the maximum amount allowed by law; 
2.  The installation of fencing, restraints, or enclosures in such a manner to provide the degree of protection warranted by the danger presented;

No permit shall be issued for a dangerous dog until all requirements of Section 4-119 shall have been met. 
E.  Judicial declaration of dangerous dog. An officer of the City, or any citizen, may initiate a municipal court proceeding to determine whether a dog is a "dangerous" dog by filing a complaint with Municipal Court Clerk.

Upon receipt of such a complaint, the City Manager shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection C, the City Manager shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the City Manager decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.

If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.

The City Manager may issue a subpoena to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The City Manager may administer oaths. 
B.  Upon written application to the City Manager, a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the manager to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request. 
C.  Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the City Manager shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him. 
D.  Within five (5) days after services of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the City Manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The City Manager shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason. 
E.  In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the City Manager or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business. 
F.  Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the manager shall be punished as provided in Section 1-108 of this Code. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the City Manager, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the City Manager pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be punished as provided in Section 1-108 of this Code.

A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or subsection D of Section 5-910 from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the City Manager are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the City Manager and which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be affected. 
B.  The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and punitive damages as provided by law, together with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff. Provided, that the plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume the attorney's fees.

It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require the City Manager or other appropriate officer or agency of the City government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement. 
B.  The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City Attorney, the Health Officer, the Building Inspector, the Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing Inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the City Manager, or any Councilor or resident, may submit through or with the consent of the City Manager to the Code Enforcement Officer, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the City or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. 
C.  Upon receiving the complaint or observing the nuisance himself, the City Manager or his designee will investigate the alleged nuisance. If he determines that a public nuisance exists, he will notify the person responsible for the nuisance. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing, by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names and addresses are not known, and the public peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the City. Such notice shall provide not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days, at the discretion of the City Manager or his designee, in which to abate such nuisance or to request a hearing as hereinafter set forth. 
D.  If the person receiving the abatement notice wishes a hearing, he must request it in writing within ten (10) days and mail or file it with the City Clerk. The hearing on his request will be before the City Manager and will be held as soon as possible after the request is filed. The City Manager shall render his decision by written memorandum and file the same with the City Clerk, who shall thereupon mail a copy to the person or persons requesting the hearing at the last known mailing address. 
E.  If the person responsible for a nuisance wishes to appeal the City Manager's decision, he may request a hearing before the City Council. Such request must be in writing and submitted to the City Clerk within five (5) days after notice of the decision of the City Manager is mailed to him. 
F.  The City Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the City Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. 
G.  If the City Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exists, it shall direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the City Council shall direct the City Manager to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by Section 16 of Title 50 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if the names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the City, collectible as other debts of the City may be collected.  
Sec. 8-409. - Abatement by suit in District Court. 
In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the City may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is located, as provided in Section 17 of Title 50 of the Oklahoma Statutes.  
Sec. 8-410. - Cost of abatement. 
If the person responsible for the nuisance is unable to pay for its removal, the work may be done by the employees of this City under supervision of the City Manager, or it may be let by contract to the lowest and best bidder, after appropriate notice, in the manner for letting other contracts.  
Sec. 8-411. - Cost to be determined, statement of cost to be sent. 
Upon the completion of the work ordered to be performed under Section 8-408 of this Code, the City Manager shall prepare a report on the cost thereof. Such report shall be itemized as to each tract, as follows: Labor, machinery rental or depreciation, fuel and supplies, cost of notice, and other costs. The City Manager shall determine the total actual costs of the work, and shall direct the City Clerk to forward a statement and demand payment thereof by certified mail with return receipt requested to the owner of the property at the address shown by the current tax rolls in the office of the treasurer of the county in which the property lies. If the statement is not paid within twenty (20) days after such statement is mailed, the City Council may direct the City Attorney to institute action to establish its lien against the property on which such work was done and to request the court to cause such property to be sold and the lien paid.  
Sec. 8-412. - Failure to pay costs, costs to be certified to County Treasurer. 
In the event the City does not elect to proceed by legal action as set forth herein, then six (6) months from the date of mailing the notice prescribed by Section 8-410 hereof, the City Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of such costs to the County Treasurer of the county in which the property upon which the work was done is located, to be levied upon the property and to be collected by the County Treasurer in the manner prescribed by the laws of this state.  
Sec. 8-413. - Nuisance unlawful. 
It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to any owner, lessee, or other person to create or maintain a nuisance within the City, or to permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his control within the City.  
Sec. 8-414. - Damages and prosecution for public offense. 
The fact that the City has abated and removed a nuisance shall in no way excuse the party responsible therefor from any damages which may have resulted prior thereto. Neither shall the order of abatement prevent the Chief of Police or other person from filing a complaint where the nuisance constitutes a public offense. The Chief of Police may file complaint in each and every instance where the nuisance amounts to a public offense, and the person responsible therefor shall be prosecuted on such complaint; on determination of guilt, he shall be punished as provided for punishment of public offenses.  
Sec. 8-415. - Health nuisances; abatement. 
A.  Pursuant to authority granted by Section 1-1011 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the Health Officer shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in the City to remove from such premises, at his own expense, any source of filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease, or any other condition adversely affecting the public health, within twenty-four (24) hours, or within such other time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute an offense. Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health Officer or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the City. 
B.  If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or other City utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a user of water from the City water system or such other utility service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of any City utility service, such cost, after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt due the City may be collected.

E.  The mayor shall issue a permit as provided for hereunder when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, he finds that:

G.  Without regard to the above provision of this section, the mayor, from his consideration of available, appropriate and necessary information, shall deny the application for a permit provided for by this chapter when, from this information, he has reason to believe that any contemplated advocacy at the proposed event will be directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and will likely incite or produce such action. 
H.  The mayor, in denying an application for a parade permit, may authorize the conduct of the parade on a date, at a time or over a route different from that named by the applicant. An applicant desiring to accept an alternate permit shall so indicate within five (5) days after notice of the action of the mayor. An alternate parade permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a parade permit under this section.

8.  Descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or depict its use; 
9.  National and local advertising concerning its use;

Sec. 10-504. - Sniffing glue, paint, and other substances. 
No person shall sniff or inhale paint, glue, gasoline, or other volatile substances for purposes of intoxication.  
Sec. 10-505. - Curfew for minors. 
A.  This section shall be known and may be cited as the "curfew ordinance" or "regulation of the presence and conduct of minor on streets and public places." 
B.  For the purposes of this section the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein: 
1.  "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen (18); 
2.  "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor as: 
a.  A natural or adoptive parent; 
b.  A legal guardian; 
c.  A person who stands in loco parentis; or 
d.  A person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court; 
3.  "Public place" means any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground, or place to which the general public has access and a right to resort for business, entertainment, or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include but not be limited to any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, café, theater, drug store, pool room, shopping center, and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the front or immediate area of the above; 
4.  "Remain" means to stand behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four (4) or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home; 
5.  "Street" means a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term street includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street; 
6.  "Time of night" is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public; and 
7.  "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth (17th) to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth (18th) birthday, making it clear that seventeen (17) or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen (18) years of age." 
C.  It is unlawful for any person seventeen (17) or less years of age (under eighteen (18) to be or remain in or upon the streets within the City at night during the period ending 6:00 a.m. and beginning: 
1.  At 10:00 p.m. for minors fifteen (15) years of age or younger; 
2.  At 12:00 midnight for minors more than fifteen (15) years of age on Sunday through Thursday; and 
3.  At 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and Sunday morning for minors more than fifteen (15) years of age. 
D.  In the following exceptional cases a minor on a City street during the nocturnal hours for which subsection C of this section is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be considered in violation of the curfew ordinance: 
1.  When accompanied by a parent of such minor; 
2.  When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area; 
3.  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned, by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone number, specifying when, and where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when the curfew ordinance is otherwise applicable to the minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication; 
4.  In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned by a parent of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number, and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination; 
5.  When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer; 
6.  When returning home, by a direct route from (and within thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) a school activity, or activity of a religious or the voluntary association, provided the minor has a written communication in the minor's possession, countersigned by a parent indicting the home address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at night; 
7.  When authorized, by regulation issued by the City Council, in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adopted to necessary night-time activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the City Council permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this curfew ordinance; 
8.  When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and his place of employment and his hours of employment or caries a valid proof of employment which may include the latest payroll receipt not over thirty (30) days old; or 
9.  When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This contemplates normal travel. This clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement through the City, particularly on normal routes. 
E.  It is unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any City street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the curfew ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall a fortior, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
F.  It shall be unlawful for any person operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow, permit or suffer the presence of minors in violation of the curfew established by this chapter. 
G.  Upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the curfew ordinance, a police officer of the City shall normally take the minor to the City police station, or other place designated by the Chief of Police, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interviewed. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age; 
1.  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances. For example, a minor of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or is known; 
2.  In any event such police officer shall within twenty-four (24) hours, file a written report with the Chief of Police. The report shall be treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with state statutes; 
3.  When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent; or 
4.  In the case of first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall cause to be personally delivered or by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of violation with a warning that any subsequent violation shall result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
H.  If after the warning notice pursuant to paragraph 4 of subsection G of this section of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates subsection E of this section (in connection with a second violation by the minor), this shall be treated as an offense by the parent. The penalty upon a plea of guilty, nolo contendere, or finding of guilt shall be as provided in Section 1-108 of this Code.  
Sec. 10-506. - False representation as blind, crippled or physically defective to obtain money, aid. 
No person shall falsely represent himself as blind, deaf, dumb, crippled or physically defective for the purpose of obtaining money or other things of value, or to secure aid or assistance on account of such false representation.

A.  No person shall by means of a telephone, willfully: 
1.  Make any comment, request, suggestion or proposal which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent; 
2.  Make a telephone call, whether or not conversation ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any person at the called number; 
3.  Permit any telephone under his control to be used for any purpose prohibited by this section; or 
4.  In conspiracy or concerted action with other persons, make repeated calls or simultaneous calls solely to harass any person at the called number. 
B.  Use of a telephone facility under this section shall include all uses made of such a facility between the points of origin and reception. Any offense under this section is a continuing offense and shall be deemed to have been committed at either the place of origin or the place of reception.

Sec. 10-509. - Disorderly house. 
A.  A disorderly house means any structure or vehicle by which the peace, comfort, health, welfare, or decency of the public is disturbed by reason of the people therein committing or resorting to any of the following acts: 
1.  The sale, distribution, possession or use of any controlled dangerous substance, the sale, distribution, possession, or use of which is declared unlawful by state statute;

The flood hazard areas of the City of Sapulpa are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.  
Sec. 12-502. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.  
Sec. 12-503. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.  
Sec. 12-504. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
Accessory structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Examples of accessory structures include but are not limited to garages and storage sheds. 
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within the City of Sapulpa subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood elevation means that elevation, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which flooding can be expected to occur on a frequency of once in every one hundred (100) years, or which is subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
BFE means base flood elevation. 
CFR means Code of Federal Regulations. 
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
Development means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Development permit means a permit issued by the City of Sapulpa Floodplain Administrator which authorizes development in a special flood hazard area in accordance with this chapter. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building built, in the case of a building in Zones AE, A, and X, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones AE, A, and X, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. 
Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 4, 1972. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

Flood insurance rate map means an official map of the City of Sapulpa on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the City of Sapulpa. 
Flood insurance study is the official report provided by FEMA for City of Sapulpa which contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity. 
Floodplain Administrator means a person accredited by the OWRB and designated by the City Council of the City of Sapulpa to administer and implement laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the management of floodplains. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flood). 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management regulations means zoning codes and ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose regulations and ordinances (such as floodplain, grading and erosion control regulations and ordinances) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within City of Sapulpa subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 12-506. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles. 
Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the City of Sapulpa's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the City of Sapulpa City Council and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the City of Sapulpa Floodplain Board. 
OWRB means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
A.  Built on a single chassis; 
B.  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
C.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
D.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
A.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions, or 
B.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Variance is a grant of relief by the City of Sapulpa City Council to a person from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of Title 44 CFR.)

Sec. 12-510. - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.  
Sec. 12-511. - Warning and disclaimer or liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sapulpa or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.  
Sec. 12-512. - Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The City Council of the City of Sapulpa designates the Director of Urban Development and/or his/her designee as Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of National Flood Insurance Program regulations in Title 44 CFR pertaining to floodplain management. 
(Ord. No. 2652)

Sec. 12-515. - Variances. 
A.  General provisions. 
1.  The City Council of the City of Sapulpa may grant variances for uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that (i) compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people and (ii) satisfies the pertinent provisions of Section 12-515. Provided, however, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards. 
2.  Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or by other laws of the state. 
3.  In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than twenty (20) years. 
4.  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the City Council, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
5.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 12-514.B and provisions of Section 12-515 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
6.  Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Chairman of the City Council which states that (i) the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation, and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
7.  At such time as the City Council deems the petition ready for notification to the public, the City Council shall schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Creek County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. 
8.  The City Council shall conduct the hearing and make determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. The City Council shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted. 
9.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and 
d.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
10.  Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the intent of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives stated in Section 12-502 of this chapter. 
11.  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any variance issued by the Floodplain Board shall be sent by the Floodplain Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of the variance. 
B.  Special provisions. 
1.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
2.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
3.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
4.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria of Section 12-515.A.5; Section 12-515.A.9; Section 12-515.B.2; and Section 12-515.B.3 of this chapter are met, and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.  
Sec. 12-516. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
A.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
B.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
C.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
D.

CHAPTER 8. - SPECIFIC USE PERMIT 
 
Sec. 12-800. - General purpose. 
The City Council may, after a public hearing and recommendation by the Sapulpa Metropolitan Area Planning Commission and after conducting a public hearing as is required in accordance with the provisions of this section, authorize for specific parcels of land, the issuance of a specific use permit. 
The uses listed in the specific use list are so clarified because of the size of the land they require or the specialized nature of the use, or they may more intensely dominate the area in which they are located, or their effects on the general public are broader in scope than other types of uses permitted in the district. 
The designation of a specific use permit as possible on the specific use list does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that such use will be permitted. Rather, each specific use permit application shall be valued as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate.  
Sec. 12-801. - Conditions for approval. 
A.  Application. Prior to submission of a request for a specific use permit, the Urban Development Director may require one (1) or more pre-application conferences with the potential applicant. In considering and determining its recommendation to the City Council relative to any application for a specific use permit, the Planning Commission may require that the applicant furnish preliminary site plans and data concerning the operation, location, function and characteristics of any use of land or building proposed. 
B.  Planning Commission requirements. The Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council the requirement of certain safeguards and conditions concerning setbacks, ingress and egress, off-street parking and loading arrangements and location or construction of buildings and uses and operation. If the Planning Commission fails to review and make a recommendation within forty-five (45) days from the date the application is accepted for processing, the City Council can take action on the application. 
C.  City Council requirements. The City Council, in the interest of the public welfare and to assure compliance with the intent of this chapter and the Sapulpa Comprehensive Plan, may deny a specific request or require such development standards and operational conditions and safeguards as are indicated to be important to the welfare and protection of adjacent property and the community as a whole and be compatible with the natural environment and the planned capacities of public services and facilities affected by the land use. This may include the requirement of having the property platted and/or the requirement of the dedication of sufficient right-of-way or easement as necessary to further the public good. The City Council may impose conditions including, but not limited to, permitted uses, lot sizes, setbacks, height limits, required facilities, buffers, open space areas, lighting, noise levels, signage, landscaping, parking and loading, compatibility, and land use density as may be indicated depending upon the proposed use and its potential effect on adjacent areas or the community. 
D.  Site plans. A site plan (plot plan) setting forth the conditions specified may be required of the applicant and such plan when accepted shall be made a part of the permit issued for the specific use. 
E.  Time limits for implementation. If for any reason the approved specific use ceases operation for a period of two (2) years, then the approval of said specific use shall be considered void and will require another public hearing review by the Planning Commission and City Council. This shall also apply to any approved specific use that does not begin operation within one (1) year of approval. This voiding of approval shall not apply if orderly progress toward completion of construction is taking place. Uses existing before the adoption of the specific use permit ordinance including non-conforming uses and their incidental and accessory uses must receive a specific use permit before any expansion of the use is permitted.

7.  Conditions of approval. In granting any sediment and erosion control permit pursuant to this section, the Environmental Administrator may impose such conditions as may be reasonably necessary to prevent creation of a nuisance or unreasonable hazard to persons or to a public or private property. Such conditions shall include (even if not specifically written in the permit), but need not be limited to: 
a.  The granting (or securing from others) and the recording in county land records of easements for drainage facilities, including the acceptance of their discharge on the property of others, and for the maintenance of slopes or erosion control facilities; 
b.  Adequate control of dust by watering, or other control methods acceptable to the Environmental Administrator, and in conformance with applicable air pollution ordinances; 
c.  Improvements of any existing grading ground surface or drainage condition on the site (not to exceed the area as proposed for work or development in the application) to meet the standards required under this section and the current City of Sapulpa Engineering Design Criteria and Standard Specifications; and 
d.  Sediment traps and basins located within a densely populated area or in the proximity of an elementary school, playground, or other area where small children may congregate without adult supervision may be requested to install additional safety related devices. 
8.  Permit authorization. The issuance of a sediment and erosion control permit shall constitute an authorization to do only that work described in the permit, or shown on the approved sediment and erosion control plan and specifications, all in strict compliance with the requirements of this section, unless each and every modification or waiver is specifically listed and given specific approval by the Environmental Administrator. 
9.  Permit duration. The permittee shall fully perform and complete all of the work required in the sequence shown on the plans within the time limit specified in the permit.

The permittee shall maintain a copy of the sediment and erosion control permit, approved plans and reports required under the sediment and erosion control permit on the work site and available for public inspection during all working hours. The permittee shall, at all times, be in conformity with the approved sediment and erosion control plan and also conform to the following: 
a.  General. Notwithstanding other conditions or provisions of the sediment and erosion control permit, or the minimum standards set forth in this section, the permittee is responsible for the prevention of damage to adjacent property. No person shall grade on land in any manner, or so close to the property line as to endanger or damage any adjoining public street, sidewalk, alley or any other public or private property without supporting and protecting such property from settling, cracking, erosion, sedimentation or other damage or personal injury which might result; and 
b.  Public ways. The permittee shall be responsible for the prompt removal of, and the correction of damages resulting from any soil, miscellaneous debris or other materials washed, spilled, tracked, dumped or otherwise deposited on public streets, highways, sidewalks or other public thoroughfare, incident to the construction activity, or during transit to and from the construction site. 
11.  Liability. The permittee is responsible for safely and legally completing the project. Neither the issuance of a sediment and erosion control permit under the provisions of this section, nor the compliance with the provisions hereto or with any condition imposed by the City of Sapulpa, shall relieve any person from responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any liability upon the City of Sapulpa for damages to persons or property. 
12.  Action upon noncompliance. 
a.  In the event work does not conform to the sediment and erosion control permit or to the plans and specifications or to any conditions imposed by the City of Sapulpa, notice to comply shall be given to the permittee in writing. The notice shall set forth a notification and compliance period of at least fifteen (15) days for the permittee to comply with the requirements of the notice, except that when an imminent hazard exists the Environmental Administrator may require that corrective work begin immediately. The notification and compliance period will begin on the day the notice is mailed to the permittee or the day the notice is posted on the property that is not conforming to the permit requirements, except that when an imminent hazard exists the Environmental Administrator may order an immediate summary abatement action to abate the violation. At the time of mailing of notice, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. Said notice shall further advise that, should the permittee fail to comply with the requirements of the notice by the established deadline, the work necessary to achieve compliance may be done by the City of Sapulpa or a designated contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the permittee. Issuance of a notice to comply shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other enforcement action. 
b.  If the City of Sapulpa finds any existing conditions not as stated in the application or approved plans, the Environmental Administrator may issue a stop-work order requiring that all construction activities halt when a construction site is in violation of this section. The stop-work order may apply to all construction activity on the subject property which may be directly or indirectly related to site drainage and which is being performed pursuant to any permits, licenses, franchises or contracts issued or approved by the City of Sapulpa. The stop-work order may order a work stoppage on all construction activity on buildings or structures and appurtenances thereto, including but not limited to building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, street work, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas lines, and all utilities including but not limited to gas, electric, telephone, and cable television. The Environmental Administrator may also suspend or revoke any sediment and erosion control, site preparation, grading, erosion control, earth change, construction, or any other permit when any part of this section is violated. 
c.  The violation of any provision of this section, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or thirty (30) days in jail, or both, plus court costs as set by the City. Each day or any portion of a day during which any violation of this section shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
d.  Other actions described in the Penalties and Administrative Remedies section of this chapter may be taken by the City of Sapulpa, including but not limited to suspension of MS4 access, water supply severance, injunctive relief, abatement, remediation, and restoration of lands. The permittee shall be responsible for the costs incurred by the City of Sapulpa. Failure to pay will result in the City of Sapulpa seeking recovery of costs and damages pursuant to the conditions set forth in this chapter. 
13.  Changes to plans. All proposals to modify the approved sediment and erosion control plans must be submitted in writing to the Environmental Administrator. No grading or any type of work in connection with any proposed modification shall be initiated without prior written approval of the Environmental Administrator. 
14.  Inspection and supervision. The City of Sapulpa shall conduct construction site inspections upon receiving a complaint of violation of this section and as needed to evaluate compliance with this section. The permittee shall notify the Environmental Administrator when there are any departures from the approved sediment and erosion control plan and at the following stages: 
a.  Upon completion of installation of perimeter sediment and erosion controls; 
b.  At least twenty-four (24) hours but not more than seventy-two (72) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) prior to commencing initial grading or land disturbing activities; 
c.  When construction and land disturbing activities are halted for a period of thirty (30) days or more; 
d.  At least twenty-four (24) hours but not more than seventy-two (72) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) prior to when construction or land disturbing activities shall recommence after being halted for a period of thirty (30) days or more; 
e.  Upon submitting a notice of termination to ODEQ in compliance with any OKR10 permit requirements; and 
f.  Upon completion of final grading, permanent drainage and erosion control facilities including established ground covers and planting, and all other work of the permit. 
15.  Maintenance during and after construction. For any property on which grading or other work has been done pursuant to a sediment and erosion control permit granted under the provisions of this section, the permittee or owner or an agent of the owner shall inspect all sediment and erosion control measures and other protective measures identified in the sediment and erosion control plan at least once every fourteen (14) calendar days and within twenty-four (24) hours of the end of a storm event of five-tenths (0.5) inches or greater and shall maintain and repair all sediment and erosion control measures, graded surfaces and erosion control facilities, drainage structures or means and other protective devices, plantings, and ground cover installed while construction is active. After construction is complete, the owner or their agent shall continue to regularly inspect the vegetation until adequate turf establishment or other suitable vegetative cover is established.  
Sec. 14-411. - Request for variance. 
A.  The City Council shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The variance request must be received by the Environmental Administrator within fifteen (15) days from the date of the Notice of Violation. 
C.  The Environmental Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving a request for variance and shall report variance decisions to ODEQ and EPA upon request. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors involved and the intent of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. 
E.  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the City Council may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.  
Sec. 14-412. - Monitoring of discharges. 
A.  The Environmental Administrator shall be permitted to enter facilities, premises, watercourses and waterways subject to regulation under this chapter for the purpose of observing, measuring, sampling, testing and inspecting as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
B.  Facility operators shall allow the Environmental Administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES or OPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. Any permits, pollution prevention plans, or other documents regarding a facility's stormwater discharge shall be made available to the Environmental Administrator when requested. 
C.  The Environmental Administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
D.  The Environmental Administrator has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Environmental Administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Environmental Administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
G.  If the Environmental Administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City of Sapulpa is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the City of Sapulpa may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

The City may pursue its right of action to recover all such costs, by utilizing any and all reasonable methods, including installment payment administered by the Finance Department. The City may recover the costs incurred by adding them to the utility bill of the violator or filing a lien on the subject property. 
F.  Water supply severance. Whenever a person has violated, or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or orders issued hereunder, water service may be severed. Service shall only recommence at the violator's expense, after the violator has satisfactorily demonstrated an ability to comply, and actual compliance. 
G.  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any NOV, administrative fine or order issued by the Environmental Administrator pursuant to this section may appeal the action as provided in this subsection. 
1.  The initiation of an appeal shall be in writing and filed with the Environmental Administrator no later than fifteen (15) days after service of notice of the action appealed from. The written notice of appeal shall specify the action appealed, detail why the action is in error, and specify provision of ordinances or statutes supporting the person's appeal.

1.  The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a warning that the "Red" or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and 
2.  Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near the limit line when the "Caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot be made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the intersection and clear the same before the "Red" signal flashes; 
C.  Red alone, "Stop": 
1.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone. Except where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the right traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and the turn shall be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street; and 
2.  Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.

1.  Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only on the red with green arrow signal; and 
2.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal; and 
E.  Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are displayed.

B.  Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by Section 17-306.A.2.h. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of the dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events as hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the City Manager no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, (if appropriate) the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the City Manager. 
C.  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standardNinety (90) day report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the City of Sapulpa a report containing the information described in Section 17-306.A.2.d through h. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users' subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 17-304.F. 
D.  Periodic compliance reports. 
1.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency to be determined by the City Manager, but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by any Federal, State, or local discharge standard, and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. This report shall include sampling location, sampling technique and chain of custody for all samples taken pursuant to this requirement. The City Manager may require significant industrial users to submit additional information regarding either the operation of the facility or other pollutants with the report. 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring facilities (sampling locations), shall be kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sampling results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in and of this section monitors any regulated pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in Section 17-306.K of this article the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify the City Manager of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.

2.  The City Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 17-304 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 17-305.D. 
3.  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless approved by the City Manager. 
4.  For the purposes of this requirement flow increases of ten (10) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed significant. 
F.  Reports of potential problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, but not limited to accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problem to the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in Section 17-302.A of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the City of Sapulpa of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
2.  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability pursuant to this chapter. 
3.  Failure to notify the City of Sapulpa of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter. 
G.  Reports from non-significant industrial users. All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the City of Sapulpa as the City Manager may require. 
H.  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting . 
1.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation: 
a.  The user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation, and 
b.  The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, and 
c.  The user shall continue to resample as long as results indicate the effluent is in violation of discharge limits or the discharge of industrial waste water is terminated. 
d.  When the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. 
2.  The industrial user is not required to resample if: 
a.  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month, or, 
b.  The control authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling. 
I.  Notification of hazardous waste. Any industrial user who commences the processing or use of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 and the EPA hazardous waste number (continuous, batch, or other). 
J.  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA and the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality. 
K.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as specified in Section 17-306.K.2, below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional-composite collection techniques.

2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab sampling techniques. 
L.  Determination of noncomplianceGrab samples. The City Manager may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
M.  Receipt of reports. Required reports and permit applications will be deemed to be submitted on the date postmarked. For documents not mailed, or illegibly postmarked, the date of receipt of the document will govern. 
N.  Record retention. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this chapter, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the City Manager. 
O.  Fraud and false statements. Reports and other documents required to be submitted or maintained by this chapter, or any permit or order issued hereunder, shall be subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001 regarding fraud or false statements and the provisions of 309c(4) of the Act, as amended, governing false statements, representations, or certification.

Sample chambers shall be accessible to personnel of the City of Sapulpa during the user's entire operational day. The City Manager may require sample chambers to be of such construction as to accommodate sampling equipment, to protect samples from freezing, and to provide adequate security for the POTW's sampling equipment. The industrial user shall submit plans and drawings of any proposed sample chamber to the City Manager for his/her approval prior to installation. If an existing sample chamber is incapable of meeting the requirements of this section, the industrial user shall, at its expense, replace, modify, or relocate said sample chamber as required by the City Manager. 
C.  Inspection and sampling. Representatives of the City of Sapulpa shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the City Manager or his representative's ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
1.  Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City of Sapulpa, the State and the EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
2.  The City of Sapulpa, the State, and the EPA shall have the right to install on the industrial users property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.

The City of Sapulpa shall publish annually, in the largest daily local newspaper, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
A.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l). 
B.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
C.  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the City Manager has determined has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interferences or pass through (including the endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public). 
D.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under 40 CFR Part 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) and Section 17-310.G of this chapter. 
E.  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance.

(Ord. 2518, 06/18/2007)  
Sec. 17-310. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
A.  Notification of violation. When the City Manager finds that any industrial user has violated or is in violation of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the City Manager or his agent may serve upon the industrial user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the City Manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City of Sapulpa to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
B.  Consent orders. The City Manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such order will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections D and E of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
C.  Show cause hearing. The City Manager may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the City Manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the industrial user. 
D.  Administrative orders. When the City Manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not come into compliance within this time period, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Administrative orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A administrative order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a administrative order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
E.  Cease and desist orders. When the City Manager finds that a user is violating this chapter, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other-pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur the City Manager may issue an order to the industrial user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements. 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive actions as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking other action against the user. 
F.  Administrative fines. 
1.  Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user that is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, its wastewater discharge permit, orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement may be fined an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. 
2.  Such fines must be paid within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the notice. 
3.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property. 
4.  Any user desiring to dispute such fines must follow the procedures set out in Section 17-310.I. 
5.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Emergency suspensions. The City Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge permit whenever suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge permit which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The City Manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to the public and/or environment. The City Manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in Section 17-310.H are initiated against the user. 
2.  Any user responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the City Manager, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearings. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing, to any emergency suspension under this section. 
H.  Termination of discharge. In addition to those provisions in Section 17-305.F of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination. 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions. 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge. 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge. 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling. 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards. 
Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 17-310.C of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. 
I.  Appeals. 
1.  City Manager. Any person affected or aggrieved by any administrative notice or order which has been entered in connection with the enforcement of any provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be granted a hearing before the City Manager. Such a person shall file, with the office of the City Manager, a request, stating the grounds for the hearing, within fifteen (15) days after the notice or order was served upon the person. Upon receipt of the request, the City Manager shall set a time and place for the hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to show why the City Manager's notice or order should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the request is filed in the City Managers offices unless the petitioner requests and shows good cause for postponement. The City Manager shall be the sole judge of whether good cause is shown. After the hearing, the City Manager may sustain, modify, or withdraw the notice or order. The decision of the City Manager shall be final unless a written notice for appeal to the City Council of the City of Sapulpa is filed with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of said decision. 
2.  City council. Appeals from any final order of the City Manager may be made to the City Council of the City of Sapulpa. A notice of appeal, specifying the grounds for such appeal, must be filed with the City Clerk's office within fifteen (15) days after service on the petitioner of the City Manager's decision. All such appeals shall be perfected when the notice of appeal is filed. Hearing on the appeal shall be de novo before the City Council at its second regular meeting following the filing of the notice of appeal. 
The proceedings of any hearing held pursuant to this section, including the findings and decisions of the City Manager and City Council, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered as a matter of public record in the office of the City Manager. 
(Ord. 2518, 06/18/2007)  
Sec. 17-311. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
A.  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the City Manager may petition the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction (or both as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user. The City Manager shall have such remedies to collect fees as are available to collect other sewer service charges. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil penalties. 
1.  Any user which has violated or continues to violate this chapter, any order or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of Sapulpa for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day. 
2.  The City of Sapulpa may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City of Sapulpa. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances. 
C.  Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in Sections 17-309 and 17-310 are not exclusive remedies.

(Ord. 2518, 06/18/2007)  
Sec. 17-313. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
A.  Upset. 
1.  Definition. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
2.  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Section 17-313.A.3 are met. 
3.  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset. 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally. A written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of a upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  Judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with a pretreatment standard. 
f.  User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
B.  General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an affirmation defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in Section 17-302.A of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference. 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the POTW was regularly in compliance with its OPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  Definitions. 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial damage to the property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this section. 
3.  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, if possible, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
4.  Prohibition of bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during the normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance. 
iii.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section. 
b.  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph 4.a of this section.

Chapter 4 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 400. - Purposes of residential districts. 
400.1.  General purposes. The residential districts are designed to: 
A.  Achieve the residential objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
B.  Protect the character of residential areas by excluding non-harmonious commercial and/or industrial activities. 
C.  Achieve a suitable environment for family by permitting in residential areas appropriate neighborhood facilities, such as churches, schools, and certain cultural and recreational facilities. 
D.  Preserve openness of living areas and avoid overcrowding by requiring minimum yards, open spaces, lot areas, and by limiting the bulk of structures. 
E.  Permit a variety of dwelling types and densities to meet the varying needs of families. 
F.  Control the density of residential development to facilitate the planning for an economical provision of streets, utilities, and other public facilities. 
400.2.  Purposes of the RE Residential Estate District. The RE District is designed to permit the development and conservation of single-family detached dwellings in a suitable environment for family life on large parcels of land at a low population density. It is the intent of this district to prohibit any other use, which would substantially interfere with the stated purposes of this district, and discourage any use that generate traffic and create congestion on neighborhood streets other than the normal traffic serving the residents on those streets. 
400.2(A).  Purpose of RE Estate Performance standards. The intent of the RE District is to provide the opportunity for development and conservation for single-family detached dwellings on larger parcels of land and with lower population densities in areas suitable for family life. The addition of these "performance" based standards helps to expand the development opportunity by allowing for adaptive alternatives for quality residential design that will meet or exceed the present standards of the RE District in areas that have unique topographical challenges and/or constraints, without compromising or waiving the City of Sapulpa Asphalt Pavement Standard Details for Residential and Commercial Streets. 
A.  RE Estate performance standards. The City Council shall determine if unique topographical challenges and/or constraints are contained in a project development site and warrant application of these, and may determine whether portion(s) or the entirety of the development project will comply. The following constraints must, at a minimum, exist on the proposed development to warrant application: 
1.  A slope analysis of the proposed development site documents that a minimum of sixty-five (65) percent of the project consists of slopes that are equal to or greater than ten (10) percent. 
2.  A determination has been made that the City of Sapulpa wastewater facilities will not be able to be expanded to support the development proposal or that one (1) or more lift station would be required to be constructed in order to utilize the City of Sapulpa facilities. 
B.  The City Council shall have the ability to approve alternative design solutions that are determined by the City Council to be equivalent to or exceed the present City of Sapulpa Engineering Design Criteria and Standards Specifications, provided that the following performance standards are followed and apply in their entirety: 
1.  The project will establish and maintain a home owners' association and will be governed according to by-laws approved by the residents of the project for the purpose of maintaining restrictive covenants and the maintenance up-keep of the project. 
2.  The project shall be designed to integrate with and otherwise preserve the character of the existing topography, including but not limited to such things as steepness of slopes, existing drainage features, river and stream terraces, ridgelines, rock outcroppings, and other scenic topographic features. These unique features will, to the reasonable extent feasible, be preserved in separate open-space development tracts, to be jointly owned and maintained by the home owners' association. 
3.  The project shall be designed so that the proposed development will minimize the degradation of these unique characteristics in the development terms of the following: 
a.  Use; 
b.  Density; 
c.  Traffic generation; 
d.  Quality of runoff water. 
4.  Recognizing the issues that can be associated with the unique topography mentioned above in [subsections] 500.2.A and 500.2.A.1, the installation of underground stormwater conveyance structures may not be feasible. If this occurs, the project may be allowed to design and construct aboveground conveyance systems that may include the use of borrow ditches. In such situations, the design and construction of said aboveground conveyance system shall be in accordance with the City of Sapulpa Engineering Design Criteria and Standard Specifications as well as the City of Sapulpa Asphalt Pavement Standard Details for Residential and Commercial Streets. 
5.  The project shall, to the reasonable extent feasible, preserve significant existing native vegetation as well as existing trees. 
6.  The project will construct and the home owners' association will maintain in perpetuity, a public trail or public pedestrian walkway system, to provide for public access throughout the development project, and provide links to adjacent existing and/or proposed pedestrian systems. If it is determined by the City Council that the construction of the above mentioned system is not feasible for the development, the project may substitute the construction and maintenance of a neighborhood park, clubhouse, or other recreation amenity. 
7.  The project shall provide a development agreement with the City of Sapulpa outlaying the construction and maintenance responsibilities of the developer and future property owners. The City of Sapulpa will not assume or accept dedication or maintenance responsibilities for common areas, wastewater collection systems that do not connect to City of Sapulpa facilities, stormwater conveyance systems and detention facilities, and public trail and/or public pedestrian walkway systems. 
400.3.  Purposes of the RS Residential Single-Family Districts. The RS-1, RS-2, and RS-3 districts are designed to permit the development and conservation of single-family detached dwellings in suitable environments in a variety of densities to meet the varying requirements of families. 
400.4.  Purpose of the RD Residential Duplex District. The RD District is designed to permit a more intense yet compatible use of tracts in or near single-family residential and other neighborhood, which because of size, topography or adjacent land use are not ideally suited for single-family use. 
400.5.  Purposes of RM Residential Multi-Family Districts. The RM-1 and RM-2 districts are designed to permit the development and conservation of multi-family dwelling types, such as garden apartments and townhouses, in suitable environments in a variety of densities to meet the varying requirements of families. 
400.6.  Purposes of the RMH Residential Mobile Home Park District. The RMH District is designed to recognize mobile home living as a residential use necessitating location in residential areas yet requiring regulation to insure a suitable living environment. 
400.7.  Purposes of the RMT Residential Multi-Family Townhouse District. The RMT district is designed to permit the development of attached single-family townhouse dwellings, on separate lots, which are designed expressly for separate ownership, in suitable residential environments at a higher density than conventional detached single-family dwellings.  
Sec. 410. - Principal uses permitted in residential districts. 
The use unit designates the principal uses permitted in the residential districts. The use units are groupings of individual uses and are fully described, including their respective off-street parking, loading, and screening requirements and other use conditions in Chapter 9.

(1)  General description. 
A.  This zoning district is intended to provide for an alternative living style land dwelling and dwelling type to conventional single-family housing. The purpose of this district is to provide a grouping of home sites within the setting of a residential subdivision for manufactured and modular housing. This district provides for individual lots which allow the manufactures home owner to own the property in which the home is situated. A minimum subdivision size is established to assure that a desirable residential environment is created, and to provide separation from neighboring conventional housing areas. Residential manufactured homes can provide a major source of acceptable housing for persons of moderate income at a time when the cost of conventional housing is increasing. 
B.  The RMH zone will allow the maximum amount of freedom possible in the design of the homes in the areas, and will provide for related recreational, commercial and other service facilities for the planned residential developments. The requirements established in this district are intended to afford adequate design planning and utilization of the land, provide for open and pedestrian space, to encourage site and development plans which will maximize compatibility between manufactured home developments and developments on adjoining land, and to protect and enhance the manufactured home site and its environs. 
(2)  Uses permitted. Property in the residential manufactured home subdivision district shall be used exclusively for the following purposes: 
A.  Single-family detached dwellings, modular homes, and residential-design manufactured homes; 
B.  Public facilities such as parks, playgrounds, community centers, churches, schools, libraries, and noncommercial facilities such as golf courses, shuffleboard courts, swimming pools and tennis courts; and 
C.  Accessory buildings and uses customary and incidental to any of the above uses when located on the same lot.

Chapter 16 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 
 
Sec. 1600. - Description. 
Planned unit development is an alternative to conventional development where the particular tract is under common ownership or control, and a detailed plan (outline development plan) for the development of the tract as a unit is proposed and submitted for public review. The supplemental zoning district PUD must be approved by the City Commission as a prerequisite to the planned unit development.  
Sec. 1610. - Purposes. 
The purposes of the Planned Unit Development are to: 
A.  Permit the innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitation on the character and intensity of use and assuring compatibility with adjoining the proximate properties; 
B.  Permit flexibility within the development to better utilize the unique physical features of the particular site; 
C.  Provide and preserve meaningful open space; and 
D.  Achieve a continuity of function and design within the development.  
Sec. 1620. - General provisions. 
Planned unit development is permitted on tracts having the supplemental district designation PUD. In every instance, the PUD is to be reviewed as to the proposed location and character of the uses and the unified treatment of the development of the tract. The regulations of the general zoning district or districts remain applicable except as specifically modified pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. No modification of use or bulk and area requirements of the applicable general use district or incorporating the provisions and requirements of the chapter is submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council and filed of record in the office of the County Clerk of the county in which the property is located. No land shall be classified in the PUD designation unless it is in an area with an approved and adopted master plan which recommends development of the land which is the subject of the application.  
Sec. 1630. - Uses permitted in planned unit development. 
1630.1.  Principal uses. The development may consist of one (1) or more of the uses permitted by right or exception within the general zoning district or districts within which the planned unit development is located, provided; (a) that if any part of the planned unit development is located within a residential district, the permitted uses may additionally include one (1) or more of the dwelling types contained in Use Unit 6, Single-Family Dwelling, Use Unit 7, Duplex Dwelling, Use Unit 8, Multi-Family Dwelling; (b) that Use Unit 9, Mobile Home Dwelling, is a permitted use only within Planned Unit Development which are located in whole or in part in an RMH District. The permitted uses may be reallocated within the development irrespective of the general zoning district boundaries. 
1630.2.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses customarily incident to the principal uses within a PUD are permitted. 
A.  Accessory commercial. In addition to accessory uses customarily incidental to a permitted principal residential use, accessory commercial facilities may be included within the residential portion of a PUD in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  Accessory commercial signs shall be limited to one (1) nameplate of not more than sixteen (16) square feet for each establishment. Nameplates shall be attached flat against a building wall and shall not be animated, flashing, or have other than indirect illumination. Window signs shall not be permitted. 
2.  The accessory commercial uses shall be internally oriented, designed primarily for the service, convenience, and benefit of the residents of the PUD, and shall be designed and located in such a manner as to be compatible with the residential use of the PUD and of adjacent properties. 
3.  Business signs accessory to principle office, commercial or industrial uses shall not exceed the general code provisions of the City of Sapulpa Zoning Code; Section 921, Use Unit 21; providing the authority may impose such additional restrictions as are necessary to maximize compatibility with adjacent land use.  
Sec. 1640. - Bulk and area requirements. 
1640.1.  Intensity of use. It is the intent of this Code that the aggregate intensity of use within the planned unit development remain substantially the same as that which would be permitted if the area were developed conventionally, but that within the development, the intensity may be reallocated irrespective of the general zoning district boundaries. 
A.  Residential intensity. The residential intensity shall not exceed a maximum number of dwelling units computed as follows: 
Maximum number of permitted dwelling units = gross area* of property located within a residential district. 
Divided by: 
Minimum land area per dwelling unit permitted in the applicable use district. 
The minimum land area per dwelling unit, for the purpose of the above described computation, shall be the lease restrictive minimum land area per dwelling unit permitted in the applicable district as set forth in Section 430.1 and Section 430.2. Each six hundred (600) square feet of a quasi-dwelling, such as a care home, shall constitute a dwelling unit. If the PUD is within two (2) or more residential districts, the permitted density shall be the sum of the permitted dwelling units computed separately for the gross area within each district. For a PUD located totally within a residential district or districts, the gross area for the purposes of the above described computation shall be reduced by the area or areas designated for any principal use other than dwelling, quasi-dwellings, residential open space and recreation areas. 
B.  Nonresidential intensity. The nonresidential intensity shall not exceed a maximum permitted floor area computed as follows: 
Maximum permitted floor area = Gross area* of property located within a nonresidential district multiplied (x) by the floor area ratio permitted either by right or exception within the bulk and area requirements of the applicable use district, except where a floor area ratio is not specified, a floor area ratio of .75 shall apply. 
The intensity of use of a PUD located within two (2) or more zoning districts of the following differing general classifications: 
Residential; 
Office; 
Commercial; 
Industrial; 
Shall be separately calculated and allocated within the planned unit development by said general classification. 
*For the purpose of intensity computations, gross area shall mean the lot area plus one-half (½)of the right-of-way of any abutting street to which the lot has access. 
1640.2.  Lot width and lot area minimums. Within a PUD, a minimum lot size requirement of eight hundred (800) square feet shall apply to lots utilized for dwelling purposes. A minimum lot width requirement of twenty (20) feet shall apply to lots utilized for dwelling purposes. 
1640.3.  Livability space. Within a PUD livability space shall be provided in an aggregate amount of not less than the amount of livability space required by the applicable use district (Section 430.1) for conventional development of a comparable number of dwelling units. Required livability space shall be provided on the lot containing the dwelling unit or units on which computed, or in common areas. Common liability space shall be designed and located so as to be accessible to the dwelling units it is intended to serve. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common livability space as will insure its continuity and conservation shall be incorporated in the subdivision plat, in compliance with the provisions of Section 1670.5. 
1640.4.  Building height and yards. Within a PUD, the Planning Commission shall prescribe building height limitations and minimum yards, which shall be incorporated within the subdivision plat in compliance with the provisions of Section 1670.5. 
1640.5.  Setbacks from abutting public streets. Within a PUD every structure shall be set back from the centerline of an abutting public street a horizontal distance of not less than one-half (½) of the right-of-way designated on the major street and highway plan, or twenty-five (25) feet if said street is not designated on the major street and highway plan.  
Sec. 1650. - Removed per Ordinance No. 2364.  
Sec. 1660. - Off-street parking and loading. 
Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as specified in the applicable use units and in conformance with the requirements of Chapter 10, Off-Street Parking and loading; provided, however, that Sections 1020.B and 1030 shall not apply. Required spaces may be provided on the lot containing the uses for which it is intended to serve or in common areas. Common parking area shall be designed and located so as to be accessible to the uses it is intended to serve. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common parking space as will insure its continuity and conservation shall be incorporated in the subdivision plat, in compliance with the provisions of Section 1670.5.  
Sec. 1670. - Administration of planned unit development. 
1670.1.  General. Any person, corporation, partnership, association, or combination thereof, owning or possessing a property right or interest in or to a tract of land may make application for the supplemental district designation PUD. Such application shall be accompanied by an outline development plan processed in the manner set forth in Sections 1670.2, 1670.3, and 1670.4.

The City Council may, after a public hearing and recommendation by the Sapulpa Metropolitan Area Planning Commission and after conducting a public hearing as is required in accordance with the provisions of this section, authorize for specific parcels of land, the issuance of a specific use permit. 
The use listed in the specific use list are so clarified because of the size of the land they require or the specialized nature of the use, or they may more intensely dominate the area in which they are located, or their effects on the general public are broader in scope than other types of uses permitted in the district. 
The designation of a specific use permit as possible on the specific use list does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that such use will be permitted. Rather, each specific use permit application shall be valued as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and community welfare and may not be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate.  
Sec. 1801. - Conditions of approval. 
A.  Application. Prior to submission of a request for a specific use permit, the Urban Development Director may require one (1) or more pre-application conferences with the potential applicant. In considering and determining its recommendation to the City Council relative to any application for a specific use permit, the Planning Commission may require that the applicant furnish preliminary site plans and data concerning the operation, location, function, and characteristics of any use of land or building proposed. 
B.  Planning Commission requirements. The Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council the requirement of certain safeguards and conditions concerning setbacks, ingress and egress, off-street parking and loading arrangements and location or construction of buildings and uses and operation. If the Planning Commission fails to review and make a recommendation within forty-five (45) days from the date the application is accepted for processing, the City Council can take action on the application. 
C.  City Council requirements. The City Council, in the interest of the public welfare and to assure compliance with the intent of this Code and the Sapulpa Comprehensive Plan, may deny a specific request or require such development standards and operational conditions and safeguards as are indicated to be important to the welfare and protection of adjacent property and the community as a whole and be compatible with the natural environment and the planned capacities of public services and facilities affected by the land use. This may include the requirement of having the property platted and/or the requirement of dedication of sufficient right-of-way or easement as necessary to further the public good. The City Council may impose conditions including, but not limited to, permitted uses, lot sizes, setbacks, height limits, required facilities, buffers, open space areas, lighting, noise levels, signage, landscaping, parking and loading, compatibility, and land use density as may be indicated depending upon the proposed use and its potential effect on adjacent areas or the community. 
D.  Site plans. A site plan (plot plan) setting forth the conditions specified may be required of the applicant and such plan when accepted shall be made a part of the permit issued for the specific use. 
E.  Time limits for implementation. If for any reason the approved specific use ceases operation for a period of two (2) years, then the approval of said specific use shall be considered void and will require another public hearing review by the Planning Commission and City Council. This shall also apply to any approved specific use that does not begin operation within one (1) year of approval. This voiding of approval shall not apply if orderly progress toward completion of construction is taking place. Uses existing before the adoption of the specific use permit ordinance including non-conforming uses and their incidental and accessory uses must receive a specific use permit before any expansion of the use is permitted.
