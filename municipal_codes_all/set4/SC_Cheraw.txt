PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the Town of Cheraw, South Carolina, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through Ord. No. 2010-08, adopted on June 8, 2010, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 3 is 3-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-1 and 5-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-1.1, 5-1.2 and 5-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 10 and 11, it will be designated as Chapter 10.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
Charter CHT:1 Charter Comparative Table CHTCT:1 Code CD1:1 Code Appendix CDA:1 Code Comparative Tables CCT:1 Charter Index CHTi:1 Code Index CDi:1  
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful keeping of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was by Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, under the direct supervision of Regina Sosinski, Editor, and Rachael Jamison, Proofreader. Credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mike Smith, Town Administrator, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2011-13, adopted Aug. 9, 2011, repealed the former Ch. 6, §§ 6-1-6-30, and enacted a new Ch. 6 as set out herein. The former Ch. 6 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2005-06, 1-11-2005. 

ARTICLE I. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 6-1. - Statutory authorization. 
(a)  Municipality. The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town Council of Cheraw, South Carolina does ordain as follows [this chapter]. 
(b)  County. The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 4, Chapters 9 (Article 1), 25, and 27, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town Council of Cheraw, South Carolina does ordain as follows [this chapter]. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-2. - Findings of fact. 
    The special flood hazard areas of Cheraw are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Cheraw as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study, dated September 16, 2011 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
    Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Chesterfield County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-5. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-6. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-8. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Cheraw or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-10. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more that $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Cheraw from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011)

    Critical development. Development that is critical to the community's public health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools, fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane storage facilities. 
    Development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building. A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water. 
    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM, or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before May 30, 1978. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
    Flood. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). An official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

    Flood-resistant material. Any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant.

Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
    Floodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure.

a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories may not be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of subsection 6-18(4) of this chapter. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in a V, VE and V1-V30 zone it must meet the requirements of [this chapter]. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG). An elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level, means, for the purpose of this chapter, the Nations Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) are shown. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929. As corrected in 1929, elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. Vertical control, as corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps. 
    New construction. Structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after (the effective date of the first floodplain management code, ordinance, or standard based upon specific technical base flood elevation data which establishes the area of special flood hazard) or (specific date). The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or after May 30, 1978. 
    Primary frontal dune. A continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope. 
    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

    Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The Act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Stable natural vegetation. The first place on the oceanfront where plants such as sea oats hold sand in place. 
    Start of construction. For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of "substantial improvement." 
    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
(3)  Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision. Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
    Variance. A grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

Sec. 6-17. - Administrative procedures. 
(a)  Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter, the administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(c)  Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(d)  Periodic inspections. The local administrator and each member of his/her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(e)  Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(f)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
(1)  The building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance; 
(2)  A hearing will be held before the local administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
(3)  Following the hearing, the local administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance, he/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(j)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this chapter and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this chapter then the local administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a Section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the chapter. Once a violation has been remedied the local administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded.

ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 6-18. - General standards. 
    Development may not occur in the special flood hazard area (SFHA) where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(3)  Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, 
(4)  Critical development. Shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data, 
(5)  Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus one foot. 
(6)  Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system, 
(7)  Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, 
(8)  Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation and lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(9)  Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(10)  Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter. 
(11)  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 6-19, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-19. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard (zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 6-4 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local administrator subsection 6-16, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 6-19(4). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot, above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 6-19(4). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b.  A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in subsection 6-15(b)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 6-26 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 6-26 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in subsection 6-19(1) of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower one foot than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  [Designs.] Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening, 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Enclosures below lowest floor. 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsection 6-19(1)-(3). 
4.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsection 6-19(1)-(4) should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-4, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
1.  It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local administrator. 
2.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b.  If subsection 6-19(5)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
c.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection 6-19(3) and the encroachment standards of subsection 6-19(5)a. are met. 
d.

Sec. 6-24. - Right to appeal. 
    Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the court. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-25. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair of rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-26. - Functionally dependent uses. 
    Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-27. - Agricultural structures. 
    Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of section 6-30, this section, and the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.  Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment; 
b.  Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs; 
c.  General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that are open on at least one side; 
d.  For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of subsection 6-19(2) of this chapter; and 
(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of subsection 6-19(4) of this chapter. 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation (BFE) so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with subsection 6-18(5) of this chapter. 
(6)  The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 6-19(5) of this chapter. 
(7)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-28. - Considerations. 
    In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-29. - Findings. 
    Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-30. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100 percent of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 8-9-2011) 
Sec. 6-31. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Violations must be corrected in accordance with subsection 6-17(e) of this chapter.

Yard Debris, Refuse, and Recycling Collection Policies 
Yard Debris Policy: 
    Yard debris is considered to be leaves, grass clippings, limbs, shrubs, and trees cut into sections not to exceed six inches in diameter and four feet in length. 
    Yard debris removal is a residential service. If a commercial business does yard work at your home, they are responsible for hauling away any yard waste generated with the exception of leaves or grass clippings. 
    All commercial businesses hired to cut trees will be responsible for the removal of such material. Property owners who cut down their own trees themselves may cut up the trees into sections less than four feet in length and six inches in diameter and put at the curb and they will be picked up. 
    For commercial or business properties the town will only pick up grass clippings and leaves. All other debris will be the responsibility of the business or commercial property owner to dispose of. 
    For debris generated on vacant lots the town will pick up one six cubic yard load of debris and the property owner will be responsible for the remainder of any other debris generated. Tree material will need to be cut into sections less than four feet and six inches in diameter. Anything larger will not be picked up. 
    Yard debris should be placed curbside away from regular trash for pick-up. Please keep leaves separate from other yard debris. Please do not place debris in ditches or in the street as this will clog up storm drains which can lead to flooding and mosquito problems. The town does not pick up dirt or rocks. 
    Christmas trees are collected curbside from December 26th to January 11th. Remove all decorations, including nails from the stand and place at the curb for pick-up. 
    Property owners found to be in violation of this policy can be fined and commercial businesses in violation of the policy can be fined or have their business license revoked. 
  Exceptions for yard debris pickup will be made in cases where storms cause excessive damage. 
Refuse Policy: 
    Regarding construction materials the town will pick up one six cubic yard load of any construction materials that a property owner does himself. Anything over six cubic yards the property owner will be responsible for disposing of. All contractors, builders, or carpenters hired by a property owner shall be responsible for removing any construction debris generated from construction or alteration of a structure at their own expense. 
    White goods (washers, dryers, stoves, refrigerators, hot water heaters) and furniture can be picked up but residents need to call and schedule a pick up from the town's public works department at 537-8430. For safety of children please remove all doors before placing items at the curb. 
    The town will not collect poisons, acid, caustic, infectious materials, explosives, chemical liquids and/or powders, household garbage, clothes, cloth material, sheet plastic, full or partially full paint containers. These items are to be taken to a county operated convenience center. Locations are on Tec Road and the Old Burns site near Society Hill. 
    Property owners found in violation of the refuse policy can be fined and contractors, builders, or carpenters found in violation of this policy can be fined or have their business license revoked. 
Recycling Program: 
    Items such as aluminum, steel and tin cans, #1 plastics (usually soft drink bottles), #2 plastics (milk jugs and detergent bottles), mixed paper (such as magazines, catalogs, telephone books, office paper, junk mail, cereal boxes, etc.) are considered recyclables and residents can participate in the town's curbside recycling program for a monthly fee. Please contact the Cheraw Town Hall at 537-8400 to sign up for this program.

The written demand shall include an address, contact number, either phone or facsimile, in order for the person to be informed of the hearing location, date, and time. It shall not be a defense to the determination that a public nuisance exists that the property is boarded up or otherwise enclosed. The board may amend or modify the notice to abate the public nuisance or, when appropriate under the facts presented, extend the time for compliance by the owner to such date as the majority of the appeals board may determine. The decisions of the board are final and shall be delivered orally to the appellant on the date of the hearing and such decision shall be written and mailed to the address provided.

This appeal stays the attachment of the lien until such time as the matter is heard and decided by the hearing board. The appeal of the assessment must be received by the administrator within five business days of the appellant's receipt of the notice of assessment. The written demand shall include an address, contact number, either phone or facsimile, in order for the person to be informed of the hearing location, date, and time. In an appeal of the assessment of costs, no testimony shall be permitted on the issue of the existence of the public nuisance. The decisions of the board are final and shall be delivered orally to the appellant on the date of the hearing, and such decision shall be written and mailed to the address provided. 
(d)  Failure to appeal assessment. Failure to timely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the assessment of costs. 
(e)  Notice of hearing. By way of the address and contact numbers provided in the written demand, the administrator shall orally advise the owner of the location, date, and time of the hearing and shall also advise the person of the hearing in writing through regular mail.

The owner, occupant, or lien holder, or their agents, representatives, or attorneys shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the appeals board in the course of the hearing and shall have the right of cross examination of the enforcement officer. When the nuisance has been abated by the town and the person has appealed the assessment of the administrative fee and actual costs, the hearing board shall have discretion to waive the administrative fee or the public cost of abating a nuisance, in whole or in part, if, in the course of the hearing reviewing the decision, the hearing board finds that justice and equity require such waiver or that any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this chapter:

(2)  The work performed in abating the nuisance;

    In the event of refusal or neglect of a person to cause such nuisance to be abated in the manner and within the time provided herein, it shall be reported to the administrator, who may, in a reasonable and prudent manner, direct the expenditure of public resources to abate the nuisance condition. The cost of the abatement shall include an administrative assessment of $150.00 in addition to the actual cost of labor and materials expended in public abatement. The person shall be served with a notice of assessment within seven days of the completion of the abatement. The notice of assessment shall include the administrative fee and a statement of public costs, attested to by affidavit, and shall be issued and served, as provided for in subsection 12-7(b) upon the person responsible for payment who shall make payment within 30 days of the date of service. Upon the expiration of the 30-day period, if the amount has not been paid in full or contested before the administrator, the administrator may cause a lien in that amount to be filed with the county clerk of court and with the town clerk. The lien shall be of record in the county courthouse and the office of the town clerk in the book of liens, until paid or recovered, or otherwise released.

    Drought alert phases. There are four drought alert phases to be determined by the Drought Response Committee for the State of South Carolina. The four phases are: 
(1)  Incipient drought. 
(2)  Moderate drought. 
(3)  Severe drought. 
(4)  Extreme drought. 
    Drought response management areas. In order to prevent overly broad response to drought conditions, drought response measures shall be considered within individual drought management areas or within individual counties. There are four drought management areas corresponding to the major river basins in South Carolina. The four areas are: 
(1)  West or Savannah. 
(2)  Central or Santee. 
(3)  Northeast or Pee Dee. 
(4)  Southern or Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto. 
    Drought response committee. A committee composed of state and local representatives created for the purpose of coordinating responses to water supply shortages with drought management areas and making recommendations for action to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and/or the governor. The committee is composed of state agency representatives from the South Carolina Emergency Management Division of the Office of the Adjutant General, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, South Carolina Department of Agriculture, South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, as well as local committees representing counties, municipalities, public service districts, private water suppliers, agriculture, industry, domestic users, regional councils of government, commissions of public works, power generation facilities, special purpose districts, and soil and water conservation districts.

    S.C. Department of Natural Resources. The state agency with primacy to implement the provisions of the Drought Response Act of 2000. 
    Water supply shortage. Lack of adequate, available water caused by drought to meet normal demands. 
Sec. 19-70. - Drought management plan. 
(a)  Introduction. To ensure that the Town of Cheraw adequately manages its water system during drought-related conditions, an organized plan is necessary for system operation and reliability, proper communications, effective coordination, and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will complement the town's ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforce the related drought response plan. 
(b)  Designation of water system drought response representative. Administering a drought plan requires an individual with the skills necessary to undertake a comprehensive public information program and the judgment to deal with equity issues arising from enforcement of a mandatory program. The drought response representative from the town will be the town's public utility director. 
(c)  Description of water system layout, water sources, capacities, and yields. 
(1)  The Town of Cheraw is located in the Pee Dee drought response management area of South Carolina. The system serves most customers within the municipality and one subdivision outside. 
(2)  The town operates a 4.5 MGD water treatment facility. The ground finish water storage is 0.75 MG. There are four elevated storage tanks in the system with a total capacity of 1.75 MG. 
(3)  The system services 6,500 customers through 2,600 water taps. The transmission lines are 16 inches through two inches that are connected through multiple directions. 
(4)  The water source available to the system is the Great Pee Dee River. 
(5)  The SCDHEC total permitted capacity of the water system is 4.5 MGD. 
(d)  Identification of specific drought or water shortage indicators. Certain historical trends provide valuable indicators of a system's ability to meet demand when demand begins to outpace supply. The Town of Cheraw has developed certain "triggers" for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of the drought response ordinance are implemented. The specific triggers are as follows: 
Moderate drought phase: River level is 18 inches at the raw water intake for three consecutive days. 
Severe drought phase: The river level is less than 12 inches at the intake for three consecutive days. 
Extreme drought phase: The river level is less than eight inches at the intake for three consecutive days. 
(e)  Cooperative agreements and alternate water supply sources. 
(1)  Successful drought management requires a comprehensive program by the water utility. Agreements with other water purveyors may be necessary for alternative water supply sources. The Town of Cheraw presently has an agreement with the Chesterfield County Rural Water Company whereby the town can receive or provide water to the rural water company during certain drought periods. 
(2)  The town will consider other mutual agreements with appropriate water purveyors as needed. 
(f)  Pre-drought planning efforts. Before the occurrence of a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of this article, it is important that certain pre-response measures be taken with the aim of conserving the system's source water, as well as the water distributed to the customer. The Town of Cheraw has taken the following such actions: 
(1)  Identification of all major water users of the system: Carolina Canners, Crown Cork & Seal Co., INA USA, Stanley Tools, and Highland Industries. 
(2)  Identification of all users with whom there are conservation agreements: all users are subject to the town ordinance [this article] concerning conservation during drought periods. 
(3)  A vigorous public education program is critical for achieving substantial water use reductions. An effective public outreach program will keep the public informed of the water supply situation, what actions will mitigate drought emergency problems, and how well the public is doing in terms of meeting the program goals. Keeping the public involved, informed, and participating in the decision-making process is key to implementing an effective drought management plan. The town uses the following public newspapers to advise the public of drought problems: The Cheraw Chronicle, The Chesterfield Shopper, The Link, and The Progressive. 
(4)  The town has installed meters on all of the town's properties in order to account for all water uses. 
(g)  Capital planning and investment for system reliability and demand forecasting. Capital improvements strongly enhance the ability of the water utility system to manage during times of drought. The utility must provide for system operation flexibility, improved pumping and storage capacity, and new technologies to meet future demands. The town's current capital improvement program includes the following: 
(1)  Installation of a water line between Cheraw and Chesterfield. Both towns have the ability to use the other for an emergency water backup source. The Chesterfield County Rural Water Company is also tied into this line. 
(2)  The town is reviewing the possibility of locating a well that can be used as an alternate water source. 
Sec. 19-71. - Proclamation of drought phases.

the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice
done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a
finding by the Board of Zoning Appeals that:
a. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the
particular piece of property.
b. These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity;
c. Because of these conditions, the application of the ordinance to the particular
piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the
utilization of the property; and

adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will
not be harmed by the granting of the variance.

declared to be a definition of the public interest by the Town Council, and the spirit of
this ordinance will not be observed by a variance which permits a use not generally
permitted in the district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by

Board of Zoning Appeals grant a variance to permit a use not generally permitted in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this
ordinance in said district.

no permitted use of land, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.

safeguards in conformity with this ordinance.

have been met by the applicant.

application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance
will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this ordinance, and will not be
injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
The Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe a time limit within which the action for which
the variance is requested shall be begun or completed, or both.
3. Effect of Failure to Meet Conditions: Violation of conditions and safeguards prescribed in
conformity with this ordinance when made a part of the terms under which the variance is
granted shall be deemed as violations of this ordinance, punishable under penalties
established herein.

decision is contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the decision of the
Board is rendered.

The Zoning Administrator is authorized to grant administrative variances upon written
application by the landowner. The variances may be for lot width, lot coverage, lot size, setbacks,
access, structure height, parking or buffer requirements, or other details as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. Such variances may only be granted should the request be within 10% (ten percent) of
the requirement stated in the Zoning Ordinance and where unusual circumstances or a particular
hardship would make strict interpretation of the ordinance go beyond the intent of Town Council.
The Zoning Administrator, at their discretion, may refer a request for a variance to the Board of
Zoning Appeals, and the applicant may appeal any decision of the Zoning Administrator to the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
The reason for such variance shall be recorded and filed in the office of the Zoning
Administrator.
There shall be no fee to request an administrative variance.
Examples of where a variance might be granted:
1. A business wants to open in an existing building. The parking lot contains 18 spaces but
17 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
the Zoning Ordinance would require 20 spaces. Requiring the addition of 2 more spaces
would be a hardship.
2. A landowner wants their property rezoned to general commercial. The minimum
square footage required to be General Commercial is 20,000 square feet. The lot is
19,500 square feet.

Article 8
General Provisions
8-1 Nonconforming Uses
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit nonconforming uses to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that
nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, reconstructed to continue
nonconformity after major damage, or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
8-1.1 Change to Another Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use, structure, or characteristic of
use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use, structure, or characteristic of use.
8-1.2 Reconstruction: A nonconforming structure shall not be demolished or removed and rebuilt or
replaced as a nonconforming structure.
8-1.3 Extension or Enlargement: A nonconforming use, structure, or characteristic of use shall not be
extended, enlarged, or intensified except in conformity with this ordinance, provided however, that any
nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly
arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. No
nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
8-1.4 Re-establishment: A nonconforming use or characteristic of use shall not be reestablished after
vacancy, abandonment, or discontinuance for any period of six (6) consecutive months, except where
Section 8-1.5 applies.
8-1.5 Reconstruction After Damage: A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or
repaired except in conformity with this ordinance after being damaged in excess of fifty (50) percent of
the replacement cost of the structure at the time of damage, provided that any permitted
reconstruction shall be begun within six (6) months from the time of damage.
8-1.6 Repair or Maintenance of Nonconforming Structures: On any building devoted in whole or in
part to any nonconformities, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing provided that the cubic content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased. Nothing in this
ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon
order of such official.
8-1.7 Nonconforming Lots of Record: In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a
single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous front
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the
37 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard
dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
8-1.8 Discontinuance of Certain Nonconforming Uses: Notwithstanding other provisions of this
Ordinance, certain nonconforming buildings or. land. uses, after this Ordinance is enacted into law, shall

within the periods of time set forth below. Upon application to the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board,
either according to general rule or upon findings in the specific case, may permit not more than one
extension as indicated below.
Notice shall be. sent by the Zoning Administrator to all nonconforming uses stating how they do not
conform to this Ordinance and stating the date by which they must either comply or cease to exist. The
date that a nonconforming use must either comply or cease to exist shall be measured from the date of
enactment or amendment of this Ordinance and shall be observed regardless of whether notice of
nonconformity is sent by the Zoning Administrator or received by. the affected owner.

Article 9
Design Standards
9-1 Accessory Buildings and Structures
No accessory building may be constructed in any portion of a required front or side yard except
as herein provided. No accessory structure may occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a required rear
yard. No accessory structure may be closer than five (5) feet from any side or rear property line. No building
may be erected within five (5) feet of any main building.
9-2 Buffers and Screening Between Certain Uses and Activities
9-2.1 Purpose: These requirements address the need for screening or buffering between certain
uses or unsightly activities and are intended to:
? Promote compatibility between uses
? Eliminate or reduce nuisances (such as litter, dirt, noise, glare of lights, odor)
? Reduce dangers from fires and explosions
? Insure provision of open space
? Reduce visual intrusion from parking areas or buildings
? Eliminate the visual impact of unsightly open storage and refuse disposal areas;
? Encourage landscaping
? Protect trees; and,
? Improve the aesthetics of development.
9-2.2 Definition: A buffer area (or buffer) is a portion of a property (usually a side and or rear
yard) which utilizes planted materials, fencing, walls, and other means of screening that
together offer a required degree of screening and separation between adjacent uses or
activities.
9-2.3 Where Buffer Areas are Required: A buffer area shall be provided in the locations and to
the extent set forth in the attached Buffer Area Requirement table, including buffers from
vacant land in some instances.
9-2.4 Responsibility for Buffer Area: Both the initial land use and all subsequent adjacent uses
bear responsibility for buffer areas. The first use to locate shall meet the requirements for being
adjacent to vacant land. The second use to develop shall provide the planted materials and or
screening necessary to complete the total buffer required between the uses, if any.
9-2.5 General Requirements:
? Buffer areas shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel,
extending to the lot line, and may be located within and be counted
toward meeting any required front, side, or rear yard setbacks.
? No part of a buffer shall be located within the public right of way.
41 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
? A buffer area may be used for passive recreation if done so without
reduction or impact on planted materials.
? If there are two or more different existing adjacent uses along a
property boundary, appropriate buffer requirements shall apply for
respective lengths of the property boundary.
9-2.6 Buffer Area Requirements: The following two tables provide buffer area requirements.
Uses not specifically listed shall meet the requirements of the use to which they are most
similar. See the subsequent section for the appropriate buffer standards. Where no buffer
symbol is provided, no buffer area is required but any applicable setbacks still apply.

9-2.7 Minimum Plant Standards: Planting materials shall be sufficiently sized so as to ensure
buffering and screening at the time of installation (that is, meeting height and density requirements of
the buffer at the time of installation). Materials will be appropriately spaced along the length of the
property boundary so as to provide maximum screening potential. Planting materials abutting vacant
property or public streets, or along fences or berms, may be two thirds the size specified at the time of
planting.
9-2.8 Maintenance Requirements: Maintenance of the buffer area, including structures,
planting materials, and grasses, shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Buffer areas will be
maintained so as to assure continued buffering. Buffered areas shall be provided with an irrigation
system or readily available water supply (at least a conveniently located hose bib). Dead or diseased
materials shall be removed and replaced with like materials such that buffer requirements of this
section continue to be met. Failure to maintain buffer areas is a violation of this Ordinance.
9-2.9 Unusual Circumstances: In case of unusual topographic circumstances or the size of the
tract involved, or where there exists screening devices comparable to the general screening
requirement, or where the installation and maintenance of walls, fences, or natural planting serve no
useful purpose, the zoning administrator is hereby empowered to waive the requirements for screening,
provided however, that the spirit and intent of this ordinance, and provisions pertaining to screening are
adhered to. In no case shall the provisions of this section be construed to negate the necessity for
establishing screening for uses which are adjacent to vacant properties.
43 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
9-2.10. Screening of Storage and Refuse Areas: Screening shall be required of all open storage
areas not devoted to retail or wholesale sales or service that is visible from any public street, including
areas for open storage of shipping containers, building materials, appliances, trash containers of four or
more cubic yards, salvage material and similar unenclosed uses. Screening shall be accomplished by an
opaque divide of not less than six (6) feet high or the normal height of the object (s) to be screened,
whichever is greater. Screening may be accomplished by all means permitted in this section, including
berms, fences, walls, and opaque massing of planting materials or combinations thereof.
9-3 Home Occupations
Occupations, professions, or trades customarily carried on by occupants of dwelling units as
secondary uses which are clearly incidental to use of dwelling units for residential purposes are allowed
as accessory uses in districts where dwelling units are permitted as permitted uses, subject to the
following provisions:
9-3.1 No person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in
such occupation.
9-3.2 The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and
subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants, and not more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the floor area of the dwelling unit shall be used in the conduct of the home occupation.
9-3.3 There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the buildings or premises, or other
visible evidence of the conduct of such occupation other than one non-illuminated sign which shall not
exceed one and a half square feet and must be attached to the dwelling.
9-3.4 The home occupation shall be conducted only in the principal structure.
9-3.5 There shall be no retail sales in connection with such home occupation except for goods
produced as part of the home occupation.
9-3.6 No equipment or process shall be used in such home occupation which creates noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses off the
premises. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates
visible or audible interference in any radio or television receivers or causes fluctuations in line voltage
off the premises.
9-3.7 No outdoor storage shall be allowed in connection with any home occupation.
9-4 Child Care Facilities and Kindergartens

district. As such, permitted uses are determined by the underlying or primary zoning district. This
district encompasses other zoning districts and the regulations contained in the Ordinance shall
apply to these districts. If there is conflict between the requirements of the HC District and the
underlying zoning designation, the HC District requirements shall govern. Boundaries are shown on

adopted by reference.
The Overlay District is divided into three areas, corresponding to three levels of review, as
follows:
The Cheraw Historic District: The properties designated within the Historic District are those
contained within the 1974 National Register finding, together with additional historic properties
added by Town Council.
Special Historic Structures: Within the Historic District, a number of properties have been
evaluated by independent architectural experts, and determined to be of special historic
importance. These structures are listed in the attached table, titled Special Historic Structures, and
designated by the Town Council as such. Due to their architectural importance, these structures are
subject to more stringent limitations on exterior modification and alteration, in order to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness. Town Council may add properties to this listing; each such addition
shall constitute an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance.
57 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
Buffer Areas: Because the character of the Historic District can be affected by the uses of
surrounding properties, Buffer Areas have been designated as part of the zoning overlay district, and
are shown on the Official Cheraw Historic District Map. These properties are situated outside the
Historic District Boundaries.
10-4 Additional Designation of Historic Properties: From time to time, Town Council may choose
to add additional properties to the Historic District. Such additions may be made at the request of a
property owner, upon recommendation of the Appearance Commission, or upon Town Councils
own initiative. All such additional designations shall constitute an amendment to the Towns Zoning
Ordinance, and the procedures for designation shall comply with the requirements for zoning
amendments. In considering additional designations, the Town shall consider whether the property:
 Has significant character, interest or value as part of the heritage of the Town;
 Is the site of an event significant in history
 Is associated with a person or persons who contributed significantly to the culture and
development of the community, state, or nation;

nation;
 Embodies distinguishing characteristics of a type, style, period, or specimen in architecture or
engineering.

substantial change in the plans for the proposed work, however if no substantial change is
made, a new application may not be filed for a period of six (6) months following the
Commissions denial.
10-8 Guidelines and Standards: In reviewing an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness,
the Appearance Commission shall take into account the architectural and historical significance
of the structure under consideration, and the exterior form and appearance of any proposed
additions or modifications to the structure, as well as the effect of such change or additions
upon other structures in the vicinity. The Appearance Commission shall use the following
standards in reviewing and acting upon applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
1. General Requirements: Generally, all modifications to exterior architectural features
and all new construction within the Cheraw Historic District shall comply with the
guidelines and standards as set forth in the publication Cheraw Preservation and
Maintenance Manual (1986) (the Manual)2 prepared under the auspices of the SC
Department of Archives and History, and specifically written for the historic and
architectural character found in the Cheraw Historic District.
2. Specific Requirements: In addition to the standards set forth in The Manual, the
following requirements shall apply:
a. Siding: Synthetic sidings, including but not limited to aluminum and vinyl, may
not be used; provided that in cases of hardship, the Commission may consider
2 The Manual is available online at www.cheraw.com under the Historic Preservation Tab
62 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
but is not required to approve, the use of synthetic sidings for exterior walls not
visible from the street and for the undersides of rafters (soffits).
b. Colors: Exterior colors shall be appropriate to the design and period of the
structure, and shall be selected from the palates as set forth in the Manual,
provided, that on a case-by-case basis, the Commission may approve alternate
or additional colors that meet the standards set forth elsewhere in this
Ordinance.
c. Signs: Signs shall not be internally lighted. Within the Historic District,
permanent signage shall be limited to the identification of commercial
institutional and historic properties. Property owners are encouraged to use
externally-lighted ground signs and wall signs where built into the building
façade. Within the commercial area, property owners are encouraged to use
signage consistent with recommendations contained the Building Façade Study,
Town of Cheraw Historic District (1979). Sign size and height shall be limited as
set forth in the sign regulations of this Ordinance.
d. New Construction: The character of the Historic District derives from the mix of
architectural styles and periods. New construction is not required to reproduce
historic structures, but it must be consistent with the size, height, design, and
general appearance of structures on nearby properties. New construction must
blend in with the character of the neighborhood in which it is situated, and
shall not disrupt the character of the Historic District.
3. Additional Requirements for Special Historic Structures: For the properties designated
herein as Special Historic Structures, the historic character of the property shall be
retained and preserved. In addition to the standards set forth herein above, the
following requirements shall apply:
a. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial
relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
b. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding
conjectural features or elements from other buildings, will not be undertaken.
c. Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques will be
preserved to the extent feasible.
d. Synthetic sidings, including but not limited to aluminum and vinyl, may not be
used.
e. Deteriorated historical features should be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, similar materials should be used if reasonably available, and the new
feature should maintain the appearance of period authenticity.
4. Exceptions to Specific Standards: The Town recognizes that from time to time, these
standards may present difficulties to property owners who wish to repair, use, or
adoptively reuse structures within the Historic District. Accordingly, the Commission
may, but is not required to, grant an exception to a specific standard set forth in the
Manual if it expressly finds:
a. The proposed action will maintain the overall appearance of period authenticity;
and
b. New, replacement or repaired features will be consistent with the architectural
features of the structure; and
c. The proposed action will not adversely affect other structures in the vicinity, or
alter the character of the Historic District.
63 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
In reviewing a request for an exception, the Commission may require the property
owner to provide materials and documents regarding the condition of the structure,
available alternatives to the proposed action, costs, and financing options. The
Commission may modify the applicants request for an exception, and shall have the
power to approve the request either in whole or in part. All exceptions must be
specified in a written attachment to the Certificate of Appropriateness.
5. Demolition: No building or structure in the Historic District shall be demolished or
otherwise removed until the owner thereof has given the Appearance Commission
ninety (90) days written notice of the proposed action. The following procedures and
guidelines shall be used by the Commission:
a. During the notice period, the Commission may negotiate with the owner and
take such advisory actions it deems appropriate to find a means of preserving
the structure. The Commission may call a public hearing to inform the public
and solicit input concerning any proposed demolition.
b. In passing upon an application to demolish, or demolish in part, or remove the
architectural appearance of any existing structure, the Appearance Commission
shall consider, among other things, the historic, architectural, and aesthetic
features of such structure, the nature and character of the surrounding area,
the use of such structure, and the importance to the Town.
c. The Commission shall have the power to deny outright the demolition or
removal of a structure if it deems the structure of such architectural or historical
significance that the removal will be detrimental to the public interest.
d. If the Commission determines that the structure has no particular historic
significance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it
may waive all or part of the 90-day notice period, thereby allowing the
demolition or removal process to proceed.
10-9 Specific Definitions: For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

buffer/screen/landscaping requirements.
3. Landscape effect: the atmosphere within parking lots in vehicle are used areas is to be parklike
rather than a hardstand of paving. In attaining this effect, trees are of primary importance, and
shall not be minimized in height or quantity. The natural landscape shall be preserved wherever
possible.
4. Pavement: the paved areas of parking lots are to be more than expenses of asphalt. It is
recommended the pavement be varied in material, texture, or color in designating vehicle
spaces, lanes, or pedestrian walks, with design emphasis on entrances and exits to the lot.
5. Lighting: parking lots in vehicle are use areas shall be lighted for efficient use during hours of

as part of the overall project design approved by the zoning administrator.
7. Interior Landscaping
a. Interior areas of parking lots shall contain planter islands located so as to best relieve
the expanse of paving. A maximum of twelve (12) parking spaces in a row will be
permitted without a planter island. This section may be modified under the following
circumstances:
i. When strict application of this Section will seriously limit the function of an area,
the required landscaping may be relocated with the approval of the zoning
administrator.
ii. In an industrial project, the zoning administrator, with town council approval,
may lower the overall landscape area from ten percent to 5 percent of the gross
parking area. This reduction apply only to the interior requirements. Perimeter
minimums will not change.
b. Planter islands shall be a minimum of fifty (50) square feet in area and shall contain at
least one (1) tree having a minimum clear trunk of five (5) feet and minimum overall
height of eight (8) feet. The remainder shall be landscaped with shrubs, lawn, ground
cover, or other approved material not to exceed three (3) feet in height.
8. Existing plant material: the natural character of the landscape shall be preserved in all possible
instances. Wherever healthy plant material exist on a site prior to its development, the above
mentioned standards may be adjusted to allow credit for such plant material, if in the opinion of
70 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e

6-10 Signage Criteria
Signage bearing business name, logo/trademark, and/or symbology associated with the business
counts toward the placement and total allowable signage. Advertised products are construed as signage;
however, they are not calculated as part of the allowable signage. Nonetheless, product advertisements
shall meet the applicable sign requirement for windows and doors.
A. Sign regulations. Unless specifically provided, signs shall conform to the requirements of the below
sections pertaining to the type, number, area, and illumination of signs. Signage requirements for
Historic District and Gateway Overlays are outlined in Article 10.
B. Sign area. The total area of all signs located on a building and/or parcel shall not exceed the
maximum sign area requirements.
C. Allowable sign area. The maximum allowable signage per business shall not exceed two (2) square
feet of sign area per linear foot of building frontage. Linear foot x 2 (square feet) = maximum
allowable signage. The exception is the case where a business does not have any direct road
frontage. Here, the maximum allow signage shall be determined by the linear foot of the building
multiplied by 1.5 square feet of sign area.
D. Illumination. Illuminated signs shall have an opaque background so that light shines through the
lettering and other designs. External illumination devices shall be placed to shield noxious glare from
adjacent properties or the eyes of motorist.
E. Sign calculations. Sign area is determined by multiplying the signs height and width. For abstract
signage, draw a line box around the tallest and widest points. Window area is calculated by the
contiguous window surface regardless of the number of window panes. Where window surface is
interrupted by a door or wall, this constitutes another window area.

readily apparent or plainly visible (to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities) from
covered areas than existing utility structures, poles and equipment located within five
hundred (500) linear feet on the same covered area as the subject utility pole or wireless
support structure.
b. Where small wireless facilities are determined to be appropriate, the use of reasonable
stealth and concealment treatments, low profile equipment and control boxes, and
screening may be required to avoid significant negative impacts on the character and visual
aesthetics of the area. However, such requirements may be waived by the Town upon a
showing that the particular location of a small wireless facility does not warrant stealth or
concealment treatments or imposes an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or
denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request.
c. Supplemental review districts identified in Section 15.5(1)c may be subject to a higher level
of review.
2. Maximum Size of Permitted Use.
a. The height of an antenna of a collocated small wireless facility shall be limited to the
greater of ten (10) feet above (a) the height of an existing or modified utility pole or
wireless support structure; or (b) the height of a new utility pole or wireless support
structure as provided in (b) below.
b. The height of a new or modified utility pole, or wireless support structure is limited to
the greater of (a) the tallest utility pole, excluding transmission poles, or wireless
support structure located in the same covered area, measured from grade, in place
within five hundred (500) linear feet on the same covered area as the subject utility pole
or wireless support structure as of the effective date of this ordinance; or (b) in the
absence of any such utility pole or wireless support structure, either (1) forty (40) feet in
any area zoned exclusively for single family residential use, unless a waiver is granted for
good cause shown, or (2) fifty (50) feet in any other area.
c. Collocation is not allowed on a decorative pole less than twenty (20) feet in height.
3. Supplemental Review Districts. Collocated Small wireless facilities and new or modified utility
poles or wireless support structures located in supplemental review districts shall be a conditional
use and subject to the design and aesthetic requirements and review processes for structures
specified in this ordinance establishing the supplemental review district(s) in addition to the
requirement of this ordinance, provided that the Town will work in good faith with the applicant to
accommodate the installation of collocated small wireless facilities and new or modified utility
poles or wireless support structures in supplemental review districts to the fullest extent
practicable. The Town reserves its right to maintain and implement the following types of
supplemental review districts.
97 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
a. Underground Districts. A wireless services provider or a wireless infrastructure provider
shall comply with nondiscriminatory requirements that prohibit electric utilities,
telecommunications, or cable providers from installing above-ground structures in the

minimize the impact to the aesthetics in a historic district or on a design district's
decorative poles. If design and concealment treatments are determined on review by
the Town to be insufficient to mitigate harm to the historic district or design district, the
application may be denied. This section may not be construed to limit a municipality's
authority to enforce historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the
preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7), the
requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), or the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. Section 300101 et seq.), and the regulations
adopted to implement those laws.
4. Appeals, Special Exceptions and Variance Requirements. Appeals of administrative decisions and
requests for special exceptions and variances from the provisions of this ordinance, when strict
application would result in an unnecessary hardship or in the inability to deploy needed small
wireless facilities, shall be heard and decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals or equivalent board
for architectural, design or historical district reviews. An applicant seeking a special exception to
construct a new decorative pole, utility pole or other wireless support structure to collocate a
small wireless facility in an underground district shall demonstrate, including certification through
an engineer, that it has diligently attempted to locate the proposed decorative pole, utility pole,
wireless support structure, or small wireless facility outside of the underground district and that

c. Cannot accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and meet the technical
requirements necessary to deliver adequate wireless service coverage or capacity; or
d. Would require modifications exceeding the three (3) foot height limitation imposed in Section
14-5(3)a.
98 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
e. The only available option to deliver adequate wireless service coverage or capacity in the search
radius requires modifications to an existing utility pole or wireless support structure exceeding
the three (3) feet height limitation imposed in Section 14.5(3)a or the installation of a new
utility pole or wireless support structure for collocation of a small wireless facility, or
f. The applicant has demonstrated other circumstances that, in the reasonable discretion of the
[board, etc.], warrant a special exception or variance. The applicant shall abide by the design,
stealth and concealment treatments imposed as conditions of the special exception.

the effective date of this ordinance shall be listed as Appendix A. The Code provisions authorizing
the district, applicable design guidelines or manual, review authority and appeal jurisdiction are
specified in Appendix A. Nothing in this ordinance shall prohibit or otherwise limit the Town from
establishing additional supplemental review districts, provided however, that facilities and
structures for which a permit was approved or deemed approved pursuant to this ordinance prior
to the establishment of the additional supplemental review district remain subject to the
provisions of this ordinance, including routine maintenance and replacement of those facilities and
structures as set out in Section 14-3(5)a and (b) of this ordinance, and not to any provisions
otherwise applicable to the additional supplemental review district. If a wireless services provider
or a wireless infrastructure provider voluntarily replaces such facilities in a manner that does not
comply with Section 14-3(5)b of this ordinance, or if a wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider voluntarily relocates such facilities, such replacement or relocation is
subject to the then-existing provisions and requirements of the additional supplemental review
district.

to its functional equivalence before the damage. if the wireless services provider or the
wireless infrastructure provider fails to make the repairs required by the Town within forty-five
(45) days after written notice, unless the Town and the wireless services provider or the wireless
infrastructure provider agree in writing to a longer time period, the town may undertake those
repairs and charge the applicable party the reasonable and documented cost of the repairs. The
Town may maintain an action to recover the costs of the repairs.
14-6 Effect of Permit
1. Authority Granted: No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from the Town
authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with the ordinance and
does not create a property right or grant any authority whatsoever to the Applicant to impinge
upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the covered area.
2. Duration. Unless construction has actually begun and is diligently pursued to completion at that
point, no permit for construction issued under this ordinance shall be valid for a period longer than
99 | C h e r a w Z o n i n g O r d i n a n c e
twelve (12) months unless both Town and applicant agree to a reasonable extension and all
required fees are paid for the term regardless of construction. The inability of the applicant to
obtain electrical power or backhaul transport services to serve the wireless facility such that it is
operational within the twelve (12) months due to the action or inaction of third-party utility
providers shall not result in the invalidity of the permit.

2. Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Town retains the right to cut or move any
wireless facility or wireless support structure located within its rights-of-way as the Town, in its
reasonable discretion, may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any
public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the Town shall notify the wireless
services provider or the wireless infrastructure provider and provide opportunity to move its own
wireless facilities or wireless support structure prior to the Town cutting or removing a wireless
facility or wireless support structure and the town shall notify the wireless services provider or the
wireless infrastructure provider after cutting or removing a wireless facility.
3. Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a wireless facility or wireless support structure
within the town rights-of-way, the wireless services provider or the wireless infrastructure
provider shall notify the Town within ninety (90) days of such abandonment. Following receipt of
such notice the Town may direct the wireless services provider or the wireless infrastructure
provider to remove all or any portion of the wireless facility or wireless support structure if the
Town, in its sole discretion, determines that such removal will be in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and welfare.
4. Abandonment by Inaction. At any point when a wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider fails to pay any required fee, or annual payment to the Town, and fails to
respond within sixty (60) days to a written inquiry from the Town as to whether the wireless
services provider or the wireless infrastructure provider intends to continue to operate a wireless
