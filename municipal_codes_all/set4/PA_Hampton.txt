CHARTER
PREAMBLE
We the people of the Township of Hampton, under authority granted to the

this Township, both now and in the future.

Powers of the Municipality
§ C-201. Powers.
The municipality has, and may exercise, any power, and may perform any
function not denied by the Constitution or laws of the United States or

individually set forth in this article, whether such powers are presently
available to the municipality or may hereafter become available.
§ C-202. Construction.

Law (Act No. 62 of 1972, as amended),1 and other Acts of the General
Assembly. Any specific mention of particular powers in this Charter is

be regarded as in addition and supplementary to the powers conferred
in general terms by this Charter. All grants of municipal power shall be
construed broadly in favor of the municipality.

All powers of the municipality, including any such power which may

"As a(n) ___________________________ (indicate position) of the Township
of Hampton, I believe and affirm:
1. That the proper operation of government requires that officials and
employees be independent and impartial in their judgments and
actions; that government decisions and policies be made in the
proper channels of the government structure; that office or position
not be used for personal gain; and that the citizens have confidence
in the integrity of its government and officials and employees;
2. That the realization of these ends is impaired wherever there
exists, or appears to exist, an actual or potential conflict between
the private interest of a municipal official or employee and the
duties of office; and that the public interest requires ethical
standards with respect to official duties;
3. Therefore, as a(n) ___________________________ of the Township of
Hampton, I assert my solemn belief that the primary responsibility
for maintaining a high level of ethics among municipal officials and
employees falls upon those in public service;
4. Consequently, I believe it is my duty to:
§ 5-40 CHARTER § 5-41
C:81
(a) Respect the rule of law, the concepts of equal treatment for all,
human dignity, and ethical conduct in the performance of my
duties;
(b) Represent and work for the common good of all the people of
the Township of Hampton and not for private interests; and to
(c) Observe and act in accordance with the Code of Ethics adopted
by the Township of Hampton."
Signed
B. The Council hereby adopts the following as the Code of Ethics for the
municipality to apply to all elected and appointed officials, members of
authorities, boards, commissions, committees, offices or agencies,
individually and collectively referred to as a "Representative" of the
municipality in said Code of Ethics;
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all elected, appointed officials,
members of the Authorities, Commissions and other representatives or
officials, shall be subject to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Public
Officials and Employees Ethics Law, Act 170 of 1978, as amended by
Act 9-1989, as further amended and reenacted.8 Any provision of the
Ethics Code of the Township of Hampton and/or of the Pennsylvania
Public Officials and Employees Ethics Law which may appear to be in
conflict or in variance with the other, shall be interpreted so that the
more stringent requirement shall be applicable.
CODE OF ETHICS
TOWNSHIP OF HAMPTON

to treat all residents of the municipality with impartiality, fairness

similar special interest.

business is conducted shall not be considered a gift or favor, nor

Department of the Township. Part-time police officers shall be the first
to be furloughed.

Council, unless, in the opinion of the Council, such person can show
good and sufficient reasons for failing to report.
E. Appointment procedures. Upon receipt of the furlough list referenced

Subsection D. If no furlough list in accordance with Subsection B is
forwarded to Council, Council shall receive the eligible list referenced
in Subsection C and shall appoint an individual who is a qualified
candidate on the eligible list, subject to Subsection D, except that if one
of the three qualified candidates on the eligible list is a veteran, as
defined by Pennsylvania law and the Act of August 1, 1975, P.L. 233, No.
92, SI, as amended, 51 Pa. C.S.A. § 7104, then that veteran shall be
entitled to the preference set forth in that Act, 51 Pa. C.S.A. § 7104(a).
Prior to receiving the eligible list herein, the Chief may give a
recommendation to Council as to who of the qualified candidates to
appoint, but Council shall, under no circumstances, be bound by such
recommendation. Whenever the name of any person is selected by the
Council from either the furlough list or eligible list to be offered a
position, the person shall be immediately notified of his appointment by
certified mail. The notice shall include the title of position and the
compensation to be paid. Should the applicant decline the appointment,

police officer and for promotions to Sergeant shall be for a
probationary period of one year. Appointments to the position of the
office of the Chief of Police shall be subject to a probationary period of
six months. The Chief of Police shall investigate the adjustment,
performance, and general acceptability of each probationer under his
supervision to determine whether such probationer is fully qualified for
permanent promotion and/or hiring. The Chief of Police shall make an
annual report on the performance and conduct of each probationer.
This report shall be included as part of the Council's monthly report and
shall be provided to the Manager as well. Each final probationary report
shall include the recommendation of the Chief of Police either to retain
or reject the probationer. Each report shall be submitted in writing to
the Council and the Manager. In the case of the Chief of Police, the
Manager of the Township shall assume the same duties relating to the
probation, that is, the Chief of Police, as is set out for other
probationers heretofore, and with the further provision that the
Manager shall submit his report in writing to the Council. Within five
calendar days after the regular meeting of the Council immediately
preceding the end of the probationary period, the Council shall notify
the Manager, in writing, of its decision to retain or reject the
probationer. The Manager, in turn, shall notify the probationer of the
decision of the Council on or before the date of the close of his
probationary period. The failure of the Chief of Police or Manager to
make or file any written report contemplated hereunder shall not affect

C:115
the validity of Council's ultimate determination regarding probationary
status including, but not limited to, retention or rejection.

full-time police officer personnel because of vacations, holidays, court
appearances and/or other activities, and as directed by the Chief of
Police. Such part-time police officers shall sign an acknowledgment on
a form prepared by the Township, wherein such police officers shall

C:169
in charge of or in possession of the property to remove any offending
obstruction in violation of this article after receiving a notice of violation,
any duly authorized employee or contractor of the Township, water
authority, water company, or other entity having jurisdiction or control over
the fire hydrant or the premises upon which the fire hydrant is located
may, without further notice to the owner or persons in charge or possession
of such property, enter upon the premises and cause the removal of all
offending obstructions to the fire hydrant or other fire protection
equipment. The costs of an such action to remove the offending obstruction
shall be charged against the owner(s) or other person(s) in charge of said
premises and shall also be charged against the real estate upon which the
fire hydrant and the offending obstructions are located and shall be a lien
upon such real estate.
§ 148-20. Township reservation of right to enter upon lands to
maintain fire hydrants.
Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as limiting in any manner the
right of the Township, water authority, water company, or any other entity
having jurisdiction or control over any fire hydrant to entering upon any
right-of-way, easement or other premises upon which any fire hydrant or
other fire protection equipment is located to cause the removal of any and
all obstructions or other objects or structure whose presence is inconsistent
with the right to gain unfettered access to and to maintain such fire hydrant
or other fire protection equipment and/or appurtenant rights-of-way,
easements or other premises upon which such fire protection equipment
is located. Nor shall any person be entitled to the return of, or to any
compensation for, any offending obstructions removed or for any damages
caused to any such obstructions or to the premises by or as a result of the
entry and removal of such obstructions.

Statutory Authorization
§ 155-101. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Township of Hampton does hereby
order as follows.

General Provisions
§ 155-201. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 155-202. Applicability.
§ 155-203. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 155-204. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 155-205. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Township of Hampton unless an
approved building permit has been obtained from the Department of
Planning and Community Development. All building permits shall
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
B. A building permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures that do not increase the footprint of the
buildings or structures.
§ 155-201 CHARTER § 155-205
C:175
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township of
Hampton or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

ARTICLE II
Grading Excavations
[Adopted 2-23-2000 by Ord. No. 584 (Ch. 9, Part 1, of the 1995 Code
of Ordinances)]
§ 161-9. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards to safeguard
persons, protect property and promote the general welfare by preventing
excess erosion, hazardous rock and soil slippage, sediment production and
other soil and water management problems by regulating and controlling
the design, construction, quality of materials, use, location and maintenance
of grading, excavation and fill.
§ 161-10. Scope.
A grading permit shall be obtained from the administrator for new grading,
excavation and fills and changes, additions or alterations made in existing
excavations or fills.
A. To establish performance standards which ensure land use practices
respectful of the natural topography and capabilities of the land.
B. To encourage maximum retention of natural topography and vegetative
features on hillsides:
(1) To prevent earthflow and rockfall landslides.
(2) To prevent soil erosion and increases in stormwater runoff which
result in stream siltation, flooding and damage to the property of
other individuals.
(3) To preserve the natural beauty of the landscape and save steep
slopes.
C. To encourage imaginative and innovative site development and building
design that adapts to and takes advantage of the best use of the natural
terrain.
D. To encourage the concept of cluster development and density transfer
in order to save open space and steep slopes.
A. New grading, excavations and fills, changes, additions, repairs or
alterations made to existing excavations and/or fills shall conform to the
provisions of this article. A permit shall not be required for work
performed by the Township or contractors employed by the Township in
a public street or alley, Township park, playground or recreation area or
on other Township property.
B. A separate grading permit shall be required for each site. One permit
shall cover the grading, excavation and any fills made on the same site.
§ 161-9 CHARTER § 161-10
C:221
§ 161-11. Exceptions.
Except where a slope of over 25% exists, a grading permit shall not be
required for any of the following:
C. Only one permit shall be required for the grading of a large continuous
parcel of land for a major planned development, such as a planned
residential development or a planned commercial development, when
the standards for the grading of the entire parcel are satisfactory to and
approved by the administrator.
D. The administrator may require an approved site plan, a building permit
or both as a prerequisite to the granting of any grading permit.
A. An excavation which does not exceed three feet in vertical depth at its
deepest point measured from the natural ground surface or cover an
area of more than 1,000 square feet; provided, that the surfaces of such
excavation do not have slope at any point steeper than four horizontal
to one vertical. However, this subsection shall not be deemed to nullify
the application of this article, or any requirement for obtaining a
grading permit, with respect to any fill made with the material from
such an excavation, unless otherwise excused by Subsections B and C
of this section.
B. A fill which does not exceed 10 cubic yards of material on any one site.
C. Fill which does not exceed three feet in vertical depth at its deepest
point measured from the natural ground surface and does not cover an
area of more than 1,000 square feet; provided, that the surfaces of such
fills do not have a slope at any point steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical.
D. An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a
building, other than a single-family dwelling, swimming pool or
underground structure authorized by a building permit and an
excavation of a driveway between a building site and the street;
provided, however, that a permit is required for an excavation of a
driveway between the building site and the street when extreme
conditions (such as excessive cut or fill) exist. However, this subsection
shall not be deemed to nullify the application of this article or any
requirement for obtaining a grading permit, with respect to any fill
made with the material from such an excavation unless otherwise
excused by Subsections B and C of this section.
E. Soil excavated under the authorization of a properly issued building
permit which is stockpiled on the same site as the excavation. If,
however, excavated material is stockpiled on a site for a period of
longer than 120 days, then a permit shall be necessary when disposing
of the fill material.
F. A single-family house site where the maximum gradient between
property lines or the maximum excavation or fill, exclusive of the

The administrator shall make the inspections hereinafter required and shall
either approve that portion of the work which has been completed or notify
the permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with the provisions of
this article.
A. If the administrator shall determine that the work proposed by the
applicant is likely to endanger any property or person, or any street or
alley, or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall be
denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger
property or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the
administrator shall consider, among other relevant factors, the
following:
(1) Possible saturation by rains, earth movements, runoff surface
waters and subsurface conditions such as the stratification and
faulting of rock, aquifers, springs and the nature and type of the
soil or rock.
B. The administrator may deny a grading permit if the use of land to be
graded, either excavation or filling, is not specifically known except for
the intent of improving the site. The administrator shall review the
application, plans, specifications and reports and determine whether
the project will improve the site, is in the best interest of the Township
and is not detrimental to the environment.
C. Any person who is aggrieved by the application of the provisions of this
article may within 15 days from the date of the denial of the permit, or
such other adverse determination by the administrator, file a written
appeal, together with all the grading permit application materials
required by this article, to the Township Council. The Township Council
shall grant a hearing upon such an appeal within 30 days after the
receipt of the written appeal. The Township Council shall render a
decision on the appeal within 30 days after the close of the hearing.
D. If any appeal is taken from the issuance of a building permit where a
grading permit has also been issued and if such appeal shall, pursuant
to the provisions of Chapter 310, Zoning, operate as a stay of all
proceedings under any such building permit, then such appeal shall
also operate to stay all proceedings under any such grading permit.
A. Grading and drainage plans approved by the administrator shall be
maintained at the site during the progress of the grading and drainage
and until the work has been approved.
B. The permit holder shall submit to the administrator an "as built"
drawing of the project before the issuance of a grading certificate of
completion.

(3) Drainage facilities.
(a) All drainage facilities that connect to or shall become public
drainage facilities shall be continuously inspected during
construction.
(b) Other drainage facilities shall be inspected before such
facilities are backfilled.
(4) Additional inspection. When in the opinion of the administrator
other inspections are necessary.
(5) Final inspection. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage, landscaping and other structures has been completed.
D. If at any stage of the work the administrator shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the excavation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger any property,
street, alley or create hazardous conditions, the administrator may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such
reasonable safety precautions be taken as the administrator considers
advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger.
E. If at any stage of the work the administrator shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the excavation or fill is not in compliance
with the plans and details submitted for the issued permit, the
administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the violation and
what remedy must be pursued by the applicant. If the violation is not
rectified within the specified amount of time, the administrator shall
proceed in accordance with the violation and enforcement
requirements outlined in § 161-32.
A. At the time of application, the applicant shall pay an application review
fee, as established by the Township Council by resolution, from time to
time, to cover the Township costs of reviewing application documents.
Any additional charges incurred by the Township to review the
application of an excavation permit shall be borne by the applicant. Any
application funds not expended by the Township shall be returned to
the applicant within a reasonable period of time.

be performed by the applicant to comply with this article and shall
be prepared and certified by the applicant's engineer or architect
and accepted as reasonable by the Township's Engineer. The
Township's Engineer shall be the final arbiter as to the
reasonableness of any cost estimates.
(2) Upon completion of the job, a maintenance bond in an amount of
15% of the cost estimated as determined in Subsection C(1) shall
be posted (payable to the Township of Hampton) for a period of 18
months.
(3) No bond shall be required if another bond or approved security is
posted for construction and/or site improvements which already
covers the cost of grading and other control facilities.
A. A fence not less than four feet in height, of a design approved by the
administrator and meeting requirements of Chapter 310, Zoning, shall

the Township. This language is not intended to prohibit the culling of
diseased, dead or dying plants or trees, the development of flow or
vegetable gardens and removal of single trees or clumps of vegetation
for aesthetic, safety or other concerns. It does prohibit the mass or
large-scale defoliation of property preparatory to development until
shortly before the proposed development actually takes place.
C. Live stream crossings. Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross
live streams. All applicable permits must be obtained from the
appropriate federal, state or county agency. Provision will be made for
the installation of culverts or bridges for such crossings.
D. Conservation of natural features. In order to prevent the denuding of
the landscape, large trees and other natural features constituting
important physical, aesthetic and economic assets to existing or
intending development work shall be preserved. All grading shall be
kept to the absolute minimum.
E. Excessive slopes. Excessive slopes of over 25% shall not be graded in
order to minimize erosion and storm runoff to protect watersheds, to
discourage erosion of soils by maintaining adequate foliage cover on
excessive slopes and to promote the perpetuation of open space on
hillsides. An excessive slope is determined as defined in § 161-12 of this
article. The areas considered to have excessive slope may be revised or
modified by the Township Council where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need or
possibility for such revision and the possibility that such revision will
produce no environmental harm.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be two horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazards. However, a
governmental review agency, professional engineer or engineering
geologist may determine the types of soil on the sites to be graded from
the soil survey, other standard surveys, geological surveys or core
borings. Maximum slopes can then be determined as follows:
§ 161-24 CHARTER § 161-25
C:233
(1) Landslide-prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing
slopes are less than 25% shall have proposed cut slopes no steeper
than three horizontal to one vertical. Soil survey map symbols are:
"GrE - Gilpin-Vandergrift Silt Loams, Slumped"
"GQF - Gilpin-Upshur Complex"
(2) Landslide prone soils where existing slopes are less than 25% shall
have proposed cut slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical. Soil survey map symbols are:

(3) Soils which are not or have a low probability of being landslide
prone shall have a slope no steeper than 1 1/2 horizontal to one
vertical. All soil survey map symbols, except the symbols listed
above, denote soils of low landslide probability.
B. Cut slopes up to 1:1 may be allowed under a grading permit; provided,
that two or more of the following conditions is satisfied:
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for
recognized soil conditions on the site. An acceptable geological
§ 161-25 HAMPTON CODE § 161-25
C:234
report signed and sealed by a professional engineer, certifying
that the steeper slope will have sufficient stability and that it will
not endanger any property or result in property damage and that
creation of a hazard will be minimal shall be submitted to and may
be approved by the administrator.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a
professional engineer or architect and approved by the
administrator is provided to support the face of the excavation.
(3) The slope proposed is demonstrated in a site plan presented to the
Planning Commission, the Environmental Advisory Council and the
Township Council to be absolutely necessary to permit the
reasonable development of the site.
C. The administrator may require that the excavation be located so that a
line having a slope of 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical measured from the
bottom of the cut slope will be entirely inside the property lines of the
property on which the excavation is made, if conditions exist which,
under applicable engineering practice, the excavation may not be
stable or safe.
D. The administrator may require an excavation to be made with a cut
slope flatter than those specified above if he finds the material in which
the excavation is to be made is unusually subject to erosion or if other
conditions exist, which under applicable engineering practice, make
such a flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
E. Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure shall not
extend below the minimum angle of repose or natural slope of the soil
under the nearest point of same unless such footing, foundation or
structure is first property underpinned or otherwise protected against
settlement. Before commencing any excavation which will affect
physically in any way an adjoining property or structures thereon, the
permit holder shall notify, in writing, the owners of adjoining property
or structures not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made
informing them excavation is planned. Adjoining properties and
structures shall be protected as provided in the Building Code30 and/or
as required by the administrator.
F. The top or bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back three feet plus
1/5 the height of the cut, which the total setback distance shall not
exceed 10 feet from adjacent property lines or street right-of-way lines
in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching
on the abutting property or street and to allow for location of proper
drainage facilities and protective devices.
G. All blasting which is conducted in the Township shall be in conformity
with state requirements and shall be in compliance with the Act of
1957, July 10, P.L. 685, 73 P.S. §§ 164 through 168, as amended, and the

C:235
§ 161-26. Fill.
Department of Labor and Industry rules and regulations promulgated
pursuant to the aforesaid statute. The administrator shall be notified 24
hours prior to any blasting.
A. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in slope
than two horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the
following conditions:
(1) The fill, in the judgment of the administrator, is located so that
settlement, sliding or erosion of the fill material will not result in
property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property, streets,
alleys, buildings, storm drains or drainageways.
(2) Soils capability and geological report, signed and sealed by a
professional engineer, experienced in erosion control and soils
analysis, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage and that
creation of a hazard will be minimal, shall be submitted to and may
be approved by the administrator.
B. The administrator may require that the fill be constructed with an
exposed surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical if he finds
that under the particular conditions such flatter surface is necessary for
stability and safety.
C. Fills, embankments and finish grading shall be designed in accordance
with the following:
(1) Where fills are located so that earth movement may result in
personal injury or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys or
buildings, the bearing value and stability of the material under
proposed fills and embankments shall be determined by subsurface
investigation performed by a professional engineer.
(2) The type of fill material available in each stage of the grading
operations shall be determined in order to plan proper filling
procedures.
(a) Rock may be incorporated in fills and embankments but only in
layers 24 inches thick, maximum, as per the latest edition of
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications,
Publication 408, with voids filled and a blanket of compacted
fill separating one layer of rock from the next. Rock fill shall
not be placed near the bottom of foundations, building caissons
and subsurface utility installations. Suitable earth shall be
reserved or provided to cover rock fill under proposed seeded
or planted areas.
§ 161-25 HAMPTON CODE § 161-26
C:236
(b) No unsuitable material including, but not limited to, the
following:
[1] Coal.
[2] Boney.
[3] Red-dog.
[4] Expansive shale.
[5] Sliding clays and cinders shall be placed in fill areas.
(c) Wood or solid waste decomposable material shall not be placed
in fill areas.
(3) No fill of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps or
other material which would create a nuisance, potential fire hazard
or sanitary problem such as decomposition which would attract
rodents, termites or other pests.
(4) On major fills or embankments, a toe bench shall be constructed
below the mantle under the toe of fill.
(5) Where fills are placed on existing slopes of 5% or more, benching of
the existing surface shall be required and indicated on the crosssections.
(6) A porous drain shall be installed on the bottom and back wall of the
toe bench and in the area, together with a drain pipe and suitable
discharge pipe to the existing non-erosive surface beyond and
below the toe of the proposed fill. The discharge location shall not
cause drainage-related problems to downstream property owners.
(7) Overfilling of slopes is desirable to permit the final shaping of the
surface to proposed grade without the addition of loose fill over the
surface of the slope; provided that no fill shall be higher than 10
feet vertically before the slope is shaped to proper grade.
(8) At the end of each workday, the horizontal surface of the fill area
shall be shaped, compacted and rolled to the outside edge to
provide for damage.
(9) All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of materials and to
prevent undesirable settlement. The fill (excepting rock) shall be
spread in a series of layers, each not exceeding 12 inches in
thickness and shall be compacted by a sheepsfoot roller or other
approved method after each layer is spread. Fill shall be placed at
the optimum moisture content for the specified degree of
compaction. The administrator may require tests or other
information if, in his opinion, the conditions or materials are such
that additional information is needed. Where fills are to have
streets, structures or public utilities placed in or on them, a
§ 161-26 CHARTER § 161-26
C:237
§ 161-27. Minimization of erosion and sediment.
Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County Pennsylvania, should be
followed. One or a combination of guidelines should be used to minimize
hazards, depending on site conditions and proposed grading. However, the
administrator may approve grading plans not meeting guidelines of the
handbook if proposed grading will not constitute a hazard. Governmental
and/or engineering reports should be used as evidence that proposed
grading will not constitute a hazard.
§ 161-28. Slope treatment and ground cover.
§ 161-29. Retaining walls.
modified proctor density of 95% shall be achieved (ASTM test
designation D 1557-78).
(10) The top or bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back three feet
plus 1/5 the height of the fill, which the total setback distance shall
not exceed 10 feet, from adjacent property lines or street right-ofway
lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge
without encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow
for location of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
D. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following limitations and
requirements:
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time
(under no circumstances for the initial permit to exceed 180 days),
said time limit to be determined by the administrator and to be
specified on the grading permit.
(2) Clean soil or earth suitable for revegetation shall be placed over
the top of exposed surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to
effectively conceal all materials within the fill, other than clean soil
or earth, both at the end of each day's operation and at the
completion of grading.
A. In order to prevent erosion, permit holder shall be required to provide
adequate and varied ground cover vegetation. The kind and character
of this cover vegetation shall be approved by the administrator upon
recommendation by the Environmental Advisory Council.
B. For slopes steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, the ground
covering shall be an approved variety of erosion-resistant vegetation.
C. The completion of fills, embankments and finish grading should be done
during a season of the year when turf or ground cover can best be
established.
§ 161-26 HAMPTON CODE § 161-29
C:238
§ 161-30. Drainage facilities.
A. If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this article,
a building permit shall not be required. The grading permit shall apply
to the retaining wall and the requirements for inspection, etc., as stated
herein shall be complied with.
B. Retaining walls shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
sound engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall
bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer or architect.
C. The backfilling of retaining walls and the construction of subterranean
drainage facilities shall be done in accordance with sound engineering
practice as determined by the Township Engineer.
D. In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face
of the wall shall be at least three feet back from the adjoining property.
(1) This requirement of Subsection D may be waived by the
administrator if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that such an
exception is necessary to ensure normal use of the property, e.g.,
for a sideline driveway.
(2) The requirement of Subsection D may also be waived when the
proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent
property owners and documents evidencing the same are filed with
the application for the permit.
A. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations and/or the sloping surface of fills
and/or adjacent properties. Interception and diversion facilities for
stormwater and surface water runoff, both above and below the cut
area during and after construction, shall be included in the design. As a
minimum, drainage facilities to the proposed retention areas shall be
designed to accommodate the severest storm that might occur during a
ten-year period.
B. The drainage pattern prior to construction shall be indicated on the
plan in accordance with § 161-13B(7) of this article and adequate
measures shall be taken to eliminate any erosion and water runoff
damage to adjacent properties during the construction and after
completion of construction.
C. Storm sewers, catch basins, drainage ditches and swales necessary to
protect adjacent properties, whether they be permanent or temporary
in nature, shall be constructed before any excavation or filling is
started. The storm sewers, catch basins, drainage ditches and swales
shall be maintained, cleaned, cleared and open during construction. If
the above is not complied with, the administrator shall stop all clearing
and grading on the site until the necessary drainage facilities are
completed or the permit will be revoked and the required bond
forfeited.
§ 161-29 CHARTER § 161-30
C:239
D. Drainage ditches shall be constructed at the toe and top of cut and fill
slopes to divert the surface water to drainage facilities during and after
construction.
E. New storm sewers and other facilities and utilities traversing a
proposed fill area shall be buried a minimum of three feet from the top
of pipe to existing grade or fill shall be constructed in that area prior to
installation of said sewers and utilities. The minimum size storm sewer
exclusive of toe drains shall be 15 inches in diameter unless a variation
in size is approved by the administrator. All storm sewers located under
pavement areas shall be reinforced concrete pipe as required by the
Township Engineer.
F. Slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and of more than 10
feet in vertical height shall be separated by a level berm of at least four
feet in width at intervals of no more than 10 feet vertically if slope is
potentially hazardous due to easily erosive material in said slope. On
slopes of two horizontal to one vertical, or less steep, the four-foot level
berms will not be required unless deemed necessary by the
administrator or Township Engineer.
G. Drainage ditches with a grade of 5% or greater shall be paved with
concrete, bituminous mixture, brick, half pipe, rubble or other hard
surface material.
H. Drainage ditches with a grade of less than 5% shall be grassed and
sloped in such a manner that they can be conveniently cut and
maintained.
I. Drainage structures, storm sewers and appurtenances shall be of
proper design and so constructed as to carry surface water and any
subsurface water encounter to the nearest practical storm drain or
natural watercourse approved by the administrator as a safe place to
deposit and receive such waters. Approval by the administrator in no
way relieves the owner of his legal responsibilities to adjacent property
owners. The owner shall also comply with all federal, state and county
laws dealing with the enclosing or discharging into existing streams or
channels. Stormwater management facilities in compliance with
Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development, shall be included in
the drainage plan.
J. If, in the judgement of the administrator, the proposed drainage
structures, storm sewers and appurtenances are not adequate, he shall
require the addition of such facilities as to ensure the prevention of
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off surface waters and/or
subsurface waters.
K. As a guide for the prevention of damage, grading plans that follow
vegetative control methods and ditch and conduit control methods in
the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania, when they suit the site. The administrator may approve
methods and materials recommended by governmental agencies,

No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the "insuring
agent") doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a
claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within
the Township of Hampton (hereinafter the "Township") where the amount
recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds
$7,500, unless the insuring agent is furnished by the Township Manager
with a municipal certificate pursuant to § 508(B) of Act 98 of 1992,31 and
unless there is compliance with § 508(C) and (D) of Act 98 of 1992 and the
provisions of this article.
§ 171-3. Certificates. [Amended 1-25-1995 by Ord. No. 500]
The Township Manager shall, upon the written request of the named
insured, specifying the tax description of the property, name and address of
the insurance company, association or exchange and the date agreed upon
by the insurance company, association or exchange and the named insured
as the date of the receipt of a loss report of the claim, furnish the insurance
company, association or exchange either of the following within 14 working
days of the request:
A. A certificate or, at the discretion of the Township Manager, a verbal
notification which shall be confirmed in writing by the insurer to the
effect that, as of the date specified in the request, there are no
delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against the
property and that, as of the date of the Manager's certificate or verbal
notification, the Township has not certified any amount as total costs
incurred by the Township for the removal, repair or securing of a
building or other structure on the property.
B. A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property as of the
date specified in the request that have not been paid as of the date of
the certificate and also showing, as of the date of the Manager's
certificate, the amount of the total costs, if any, certified to the Manager

that have been incurred by the Township for the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the property. The Township
shall certify to the insured the total amount, if any, of such costs. A tax,
assessment, penalty or user charge becomes delinquent at the time and
on the date a lien could otherwise have been filed against the property
by the Township under applicable law.
C. When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company,
association or exchange equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits
of liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure,
the insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds to the Manager of the Township in the aggregate
amount $2,000 for each $15,000 and each fraction of that amount of a
claim, or, if at the time of loss report the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the
amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurance
company, association or exchange shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. The transfer of proceeds
shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges
insuring the building or other structure. The named insured may submit
a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure after the transfer and the
designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured if the Township has not commenced to
remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
D. Upon receipt of proceeds by the Township as authorized by this section,
the Manager shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the Township. When transferring the funds as
required in the above, an insurance company, association or exchange
shall provide the Township with the name and address of the named
insured, whereupon the Township shall contact the named insured,
certify that the proceeds have been received by the Township and notify
the named insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be
followed. The fund shall be returned to the named insured when
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have
been completed and the required proof received by the designated
officer if the Township has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal
or securing. If the Township has incurred costs for repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from
the fund, and, if excess funds remain, the Township shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit of the Township to recover any deficiency. Further,
nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the Township
and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits
the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

§ 178-1. Purpose; policy; authority.
The Council finds that the crass commercial exploitation of explicit sexual
conduct through the public exhibition of lewd films, and the display and/
or sale of lewd publications, and the use of so-called massage parlors
and model studios for purposes of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution,
constitutes a debasement and distortion of a sensitive key relationship
of human existence, essential to family life, community welfare and the
development of human personalities; is indecent and offensive to the senses
and to public morals and interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life
and property, in that such interferes with the interest of the public in the
quality of life and total community environment, the tone of commerce in
the Township, property values, and public safety; and that the operation
of such activities is detrimental to the best health, safety, convenience,
good morals and general welfare of the Township of Hampton, and of the
residents, citizens, inhabitants and businesses thereof. The Council hereby
declares such activities to be a public nuisance, and herein establishes

structures, facilities, utilities, roadways, plantings, landscaping,
trees and other existing growth. Great care shall be exercised to do
the least amount of damage as possible. No trees shall be cut
unless it is absolutely necessary. Trees and growth that are cleared
shall be burned or hauled away as soon as possible in accordance
with the Allegheny County Smoke Control and burning laws, which
entails obtaining a fire permit from the county if burning is to be
done.
(2) Even though the sewer is to be placed in a public right-of-way,
which is adjacent to, or in front of, a private property, the
contractor shall notify the owner of said property as to his
intentions and methods of construction and restoration.
(3) When crossing or placing a sewer in the paved portion of either
public or private roads, the amount of pavement to be removed
shall not exceed the normal width of the trench by more than six
inches on each side of the trench. The contractor shall use such
methods as either drilling or chipping before excavation, which will
assure the breaking of the pavement along straight lines. The face
of the remaining pavement shall be vertical to assure proper
restoration of the pavement.
B. Lines and depths of excavation.
(1) The excavation shall be done by equipment adequate enough to do
the work, but not oversized causing extreme damage to the
surrounding area. The width and depth of the excavation shall be
such as to provide sufficient area to install the pipe and manholes
and shall be to the lines and grades indicated on the approved
plans. The width of trenches at the springing line of the pipe shall
have a minimum clearance of six inches between the outside of the
pipe and the side of the trench. The bottom of the trench shall be
prepared with bell holes of sufficient size at proper intervals so that
the trench load on the sewer is supported by the barrel of the pipe
and not the bell. In all cases, the bottom quadrant of the pipe shall
be fully and uniformly supported.
(2) Unauthorized excavation below the depth required shall be filled
with sand, granulated slag, gravel or concrete.
(3) When wet or water conditions are encountered, an underdrain
beneath the pipe is mandatory. The underdrain material shall be
Type 2-B stone, slag, or gravel, and shall be at least six inches deep
the full width of the trench.
(4) When rock or rocky conditions are encountered, a supplementary
foundation shall be provided for uniform support of the pipe. This
foundation shall consist of granular material such as sand or
granulated slag. "Rocky conditions" shall be defined as shale or
§ 250-15 HAMPTON CODE § 250-15
C:344
stones of a size that prevent the placing of the pipe with uniform
support.
(5) When either of the above special beddings are used, the trench
shall be excavated six inches below the required depth as shown on
the approved plans.
(6) The trench shall at all times be excavated to the required width and
depth for a distance of at least 10 feet in advance of the end of the
pipe in place, except when rock is encountered; then the trench
shall be opened 30 feet in advance. No trench shall be opened more
than 100 feet in advance.
(7) When work is being done in roadways the excavated materials
along with the construction material and the method of
construction shall be so handled to maintain one-way traffic at all
times.
C. Shoring.
(1) Shoring for the purpose of safety shall follow strictly the
"Regulations for Excavation and Construction" of the Department
of Labor and Industry of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as
amended.
(2) It is specifically required that notice by the contractor be given to
the Department of Labor and Industry on the prescribed form
before any excavation is begun. Copies of these notices shall be
sent to the Township.
D. Extreme water conditions. When there are extreme water conditions in
the excavation, the contractor shall pump, bail or use other means to
dewater the trench, making it suitable to place the underdrain and lay
the pipe. The contractor may be required to lay a terra cotta, open
jointed, stone-imbedded drain below the sewer to provide subsoil
drainage. All groundwater shall be diverted from entering the
excavation.
E. Blasting. Blasting may be permitted; permission to blast must be
obtained from the Township after submitting to the Township a
certificate of insurance showing that the contractor has liability
insurance in a sufficient amount for the particular project. No blasting
will be allowed within five feet of existing gas or water lines; within 25
feet of existing structures; within 25 feet of recently laid sewer pipe;
and during the first 48 hours after concrete has been placed within the
area of the site. When blasting is permitted, each shot shall be covered
with suitable timber mats to prevent particles from being thrown, and
all rules and regulations for the use of dynamite as set forth by the U.S.
Bureau of Mines, the state and local government shall be adhered to.
Caps or other detonators along with dynamite shall be stored so that
the utmost safety is accomplished.

C:345
§ 250-16. Laying of pipe; specifications.
A. Pipe placement.
(1) All pipe shall be laid to a uniform line and grade, socket ends
upgrade, with a firm and even bearing along the barrel of the pipe,
close joints, and smooth invert. Care shall be used to make certain
each joint is completely and properly jointed to the previously laid
pipe. The interior of each pipe shall be cleaned of all excess joint
and foreign material before the next pipe is laid.
(2) No pipe shall be laid in water or when trench conditions or weather
is unsuitable for such work.
(3) Wyes, tees or other connections shall be fitted with watertight
stoppers and located under the direction of the Township. At the
close of each day's work, or at such other times when pipe is not
being laid, the open end of the pipe shall be protected with a closefitting
plug so as not to allow dirt to enter the line. Each morning
the line should be checked to insure cleanliness before continuing
to lay pipe.
(4) When laying pipe, the contractor shall use three batter boards at
twenty-five-foot intervals at all times. Grade stakes shall be spaced
at twenty-five foot and so located that the grades can readily be
transferred to the batter boards. Complete cut sheets shall be
submitted to the Township prior to the start of construction.
B. Handling of pipe. The contractor shall exercise great care in handling
the pipe and accessories so that no damage is encountered. Any pipe
found to be damaged shall be marked as such and removed from the
immediate work area.
C. Pipe size. The size of pipe to be used shall be in accordance with the
plans approved by the Township.
D. Laterals.
(1) All laterals for proposed dwellings shall be extended to property
lines. They shall be plugged with watertight plugs and marked to
the surface of the ground with a wood marker. Such wood markers
shall extend two feet above proposed grade level and marked
"Lateral End." The end of any lateral or wye shall be no deeper than
six feet unless permission is given by the Township for a depth
greater.
(2) All laterals from sewer main to house sewer shall be a six-inch
premium joint pipe.
E. Changes in approved plans. When field conditions are such that the
contractor feels it is necessary to change the line or grade on a sewer
line, he should anticipate such a change as early as possible and submit
a request for the change to the Township. The Township in some cases
§ 250-16 HAMPTON CODE § 250-16
C:346
§ 250-17. Backfilling.
may require plans of the changes. No deviation from the approved plans
shall be made without the Township approval.
F. Placing of manholes. After the base of a manhole is poured, no manhole
sections or brickwork will be placed for at least 72 hours. All brick
manholes shall be completely cement-plastered on the outside with
Thoroseal® or equivalent as follows:
(1) Two feet up on the bottom on the inside and outside, being sure to
cover the areas adjacent to where the pipes entered the manholes.
(2) Inside and outside of each joint.
(3) Inside and outside at the joint of the casting. All manholes located
in existing landscaped areas shall be set to grade. All manholes in
unlandscaped areas shall be set one foot above final grade.
Manholes located in paved areas shall be set 1/2 inch to one inch
higher than the paved surface.
A. General.
(1) The backfill operation shall not start until the sewers and other
work have been inspected and approved as satisfactory by the
Township Inspector. If the work is found not to be satisfactory with
respect to workmanship and material, the contractor shall
immediately remedy the unsatisfactory condition. The trench and
excavation shall be backfilled as soon as possible after the approval
of the work has been given.
(2) The material used for backfilling the pipe shall be clean earth, sand
or granulated slag free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable and
organic material, boulders, rocks, stone or other material which, in
the opinion of the Township, is unsuitable. Backfill material shall
not be frozen when placed in the excavation.
B. Method of backfilling.
(1) The backfill material shall be thoroughly compacted as it is placed,
taking care to prevent displacement or injury to the sewer pipe. In
backfilling immediately around the pipe, the space between the
pipe and the bottom and sides of the trench shall be filled by hand
in four-inch layers, keeping each side of the pipe at the same level
and thoroughly tamping each layer with an approved tamper.
Caution should be used in tamping with a mechanical tamper so the
pipe is not touched, preventing damage to the pipe. The backfill
shall then be placed from the top of the pipe to a depth of two feet
above the pipe in six-inch layers, thoroughly tamping and
compacting each layer. The remainder of the trench shall be
backfilled in layers, the depth of which may vary with the type of
§ 250-16 CHARTER § 250-17
C:347
§ 250-18. Testing of sewer.
equipment used for compaction. Under no circumstances shall
these layers be greater in thickness than 18 inches.
(2) Backfilling within two feet of manholes and other structures shall
be accomplished in the same manner as that used around the sides
in layers not exceeding six inches in depth, and solidly tamped in
such a manner as to avoid damaging the structures or producing
unequal pressures upon them.
(3) When sheeting or shoring is removed, all cavities remaining in or
adjoining the trench shall be solidly filled, and when the sheeting or
shoring is to be left in place, all cavities behind the same shall be
solidly filled.
(4) When backfilling under existing or proposed roads, whether public
or private, or under existing or proposed structures of any nature,
the trench shall be completely filled with sand or granulated slag.
(5) The backfill material within two feet of iron pipe shall be clay, sand,
gravel or other approved material that will not be injurious to the
pipe. Slag, cinders, rubbish or other such material shall not be used
in this instance.
(6) There shall be no working or walking on any completed sewer until
the trench has been backfilled at least two feet over the top of the
pipe, except, of course, as required for backfilling and tamping.
(7) All backfilled trenches, except those in roadways, shall be left
sufficiently high to allow for settlement to grade after
consolidation.
(8) No backfilling shall be done when either the backfill material or the
trench is frozen.
(9) The contractor is responsible for maintaining backfilled trenches
that are located in existing roadways, whether they are public or
private, until the permanent paving is placed. The permanent
paving shall not be placed until permission is given by the Township
Inspector.
A. Cleaning.
(1) Each section of sewer will be lamped by the Township Inspector to
insure that the line is clean.
(2) Manholes and other structures will be checked by the Township
Inspector to insure that they are clean.
B. Infiltration.
§ 250-17 HAMPTON CODE § 250-18
C:348
§ 250-19. Restoration.
§ 250-20. Inspections.
(1) A rate of infiltration of groundwater into the sewer, including
appurtenances of the sewer, in excess of 500 gallons per inch
diameter per mile per day will be considered as evidence of inferior
work or defective materials and will require repair or replacement
by the contractor. Any known points of infiltration shall be repaired
in spite of the infiltration rate. An exfiltration test shall be required
if deemed necessary by the Township Inspector or Engineer, which
test may be made on any selected portion of sewer from manhole to
manhole, which length would not exceed 400 feet. This test would
be in accordance with the following and water lost by reason of
leakage would be considered to represent an equal amount of
infiltration:
(a) The effluent sewer at the lower manhole would be plugged and
the influent sewer at the upper manhole would be plugged. The
sewer and manhole would then be filled with water to a point
such that there would be four feet of water over the crown of
the pipe at the upper end. A record of the amount of water
added necessary to maintain this water level for a twelve-hour
period shall be used to compute the rate of infiltration.
(2) In addition to all other tests, smoke testing by the contractor will be
required.
A. Landscaped area. All areas where existing lawns, shrubs or plantings
have been disturbed shall be restored to its original condition,
reseeding lawns with the type of grass which was removed; replacing
shrubs with similar shrubs; plantings with similar plantings. Topsoil
must be replaced to a depth of four inches and fertilizer added as
deemed necessary by the Township.
B. Open and wooded areas.
(1) Areas which are near proposed roadways, or proposed dwellings or
will be seen from the same, shall be restored by planting perennial
rye grass uniformly spread at a rate of four pounds per 1,000
square feet and then covered with straw or mulch to protect
against the seed washing away.
(2) Areas which are in woods or ravines shall be seeded at a uniform
rate of four pounds per 1,000 square feet. No covering is necessary.
(3) Sloped embankments in wooded areas and ravines that are steeper
than one foot horizontal to 1 1/2 feet vertical shall be planted with
crown vetch, or similar vegetation that has the same hardiness.
A. Notice of inspection. When the contractor requires an inspection, he
shall notify the Township office 24 hours in advance. (Usually the

fees, inspection fees, blasting bond cost, etc., will be the responsibility of
the contractor.
contractor will be able to set up a schedule of inspections for the entire
job.) Under no circumstances shall the contractor backfill or cover any
sewer line or structure or any other work without the approval of the
Township Inspector.
B. Required inspections.
(1) All sewers laid within the Township limits, whether publicly or
privately owned, shall be inspected by the Township Inspector prior
to any backfilling.
(2) All manhole bases, concrete chambers, pump stations foundations,
concrete encasements and other subsurface structures shall be
inspected prior to backfilling.
(3) The backfill of the above two items shall be inspected after the
material is in place and compacted to two feet above the pipe.
(4) All manholes shall be inspected both on the outside and inside prior
to backfilling them.
(5) The Township shall be notified 24 hours in advance of the
commencing of the exfiltration tests.
(6) Prior to the Township's acceptance of the project, a final inspection
will be made of the entire job.
C. Failure to pass inspection.
(1) When any work is found not acceptable, the contractor will be
notified immediately by the Township. The contractor shall as soon
as possible remedy the condition and notify the Township for
another inspection. The contractor shall continue to work on an
unpassable condition until it is approved by the Township.
(2) If, for any reason whatsoever, the contractor does not remedy or
give notice that he intends to remedy a condition that is
unacceptable, within 10 days of the notice from the Township of the
unacceptability, the Township shall give written notice of the
default to the contractor giving him 30 days to do the work or state
his intention. At the end of 30 days, if no action has been taken by
the contractor, the Township shall notify the bonding company of
the contractor, asking them to correct the unacceptable work.

recyclable materials designated by the Township from all other
municipal waste produced at their homes, apartments and other
residential establishments, store such materials for collection, and shall
place same for collection in accordance with the guidelines established
hereunder.
(1) Persons in residences must separate recyclable materials from
other refuse. For those residences utilizing the Township's
authorized agent, recyclable materials shall be placed at the
curbside in containers provided by the Township for collection. Any
containers provided to residences for collection of recyclable
materials shall be the property of the Township and shall be used
only for the collection of recyclable materials. Any resident who
moves within or from the Township shall be responsible for leaving
the allocated container within the residence or shall pay the
replacement cost of said container(s). Use of recycling containers
for any purpose other than the designated recycling program or
use of the recycling containers by any person other than the person
allocated such container(s) shall be a violation of this article.
(2) Residents may, if necessary, purchase additional containers of their
choosing for recyclable materials. However, any such container
must bear the self-adhesive recycling logo label. The labels are
available at the Township office free of charge.
(3) If recyclable materials are collected by a collector other than the
Township or its authorized agent (owners, landlords and agents of
owners or landlords, but excluding individual residents), such
collector shall submit an annual report to the Township reporting
the tonnage of materials recycled during the previous year.
(4) An owner, landowner or agent of an owner or landlord of a
multifamily rental housing property with three units or more must
comply with its recycling responsibilities by establishing a
collection system at each property. The collection system must
include suitable containers for collecting and sorting the recyclable
materials, easily accessible locations for the containers, and
written instructions to the occupants concerning the use and
availability of the collections system.
(5) If recyclable materials are collected by a collector other than the
Township or its authorized agent (owners, landlords and agents of
owners or landlords), such collector shall submit an annual report
to the Township reporting the tonnage of materials recycled during
the previous year.
B. All persons must separate leaf waste from other municipal waste
generated at their houses, apartments and other residential
establishments for collection unless those persons have otherwise
provided for composting of leaf waste.
§ 260-5 HAMPTON CODE § 260-5
C:366
C. Persons must separate high-grade office paper, aluminum, corrugated

establishments and from community activities and store the recyclable
materials until collection. A person may be exempted from this
subsection if that person submits documentation to the Township
annually indicating that the designated recyclable materials are
collected by a collector other than the Township or its authorized agent.
Occupants of said establishments shall submit an annual report to the
Township reporting the tonnage of materials recycled during the
previous year; provided, that such person shall submit, at a minimum,
an annual recycling report to the Township Manager. The report shall
document the amount of municipal waste generated per year as well as
the type and weight of materials that were recycled in the previous
calendar year. Valid documentation shall include information from an
end-use recycler or waste hauler which describes the type and weight
of each recyclable material that was collected and marketed.
Documentation may be in the form of one of the following:
(1) Copies of weight receipts or statements which consolidate such
information.
(2) A report from the provider of recycling collection services which
identifies the amount of each material collected and marketed. The
type and weight of recyclables generated by an individual
establishment may be approximated based on a representative
sample of its source separated materials.
(3) A report from the provider of waste collection services that
identifies the type and weight of each recyclable material collected
and marketed in cases where recyclables are commingled with the
establishment's waste. The type and weight of recyclables
generated by an individual establishment may be approximated
based on a representative sample of its waste.
(4) For Subsection C(2) and (3), where recyclables from several
establishments are collected in the same vehicle, an individual
establishment's contribution to the load may be apportioned. Only
the weight of materials marketed for recycling purposes can be
credited to an establishment.
D. All employees, users (patrons), and residents of commercial, municipal
and institutional establishments shall be informed by their employer of
the recycling program. The education program shall describe the
program's features and requirements, and should include at a minimum
an annual program meeting and an orientation to the program upon the
arrival of a new employee or resident. Receptacles should be clearly
marked with the recycling symbol and the type or recyclable material
that is to be placed in the receptacle, and signs should be prominently
displayed stating the requirements of the program.

ARTICLE I
Purpose and Findings
§ 266-1.1. Findings.
The Township of Hampton finds that:
§ 266-1.2. Purpose.
In order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents
of the Township of Hampton, as well as to protect, sustain, and enhance
the surface and groundwater resources of the Township, drainage and
stormwater management practices shall be utilized as directed herein to
achieve the following goals and objectives:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Accommodate site development and redevelopment in a manner that
protects public safety and that is consistent with (or reestablishes) the
natural hydrologic characteristics of each watershed and sustains
groundwater recharge, stream baseflows, stable stream channel
(geomorphology) conditions, the carrying capacity of streams and their
floodplains, groundwater and surface water quality, and aquatic living
resources and their habitats.
B. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated.
C. Protect natural infiltration and groundwater recharge rates in order to
sustain groundwater supplies and stream baseflows.
§ 266-1.1 CHARTER § 266-1.2
C:381
D. Maintain runoff characteristics of the site after completion of
development that are consistent with the carrying capacity and stable
channel conditions of the receiving streams.
E. Protect water quality by removing and/or treating pollutants prior to
discharge to ground- and surface waters throughout the Township, and
to protect, restore, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological
quality of ground- and surface waters.
F. Protect in-stream channels and geomorphologic conditions of the
receiving streams; protect against scour, aggradation, and degradation;
protect their flood-carrying capacity and aquatic habitats and to reduce
in-stream erosion and sedimentation.
G. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
H. Reduce flooding impacts and prevent a significant increase in surface
runoff rates and volumes, predevelopment to post-development, which
could worsen flooding downstream in the watershed, enlarge
floodplains, erode stream banks and create other flood-related healthwelfare-
property losses; in general, to preserve and restore the natural
flood-carrying capacity of streams and their floodplains.
I. Protect adjacent lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater
discharges.
J. Ensure effective long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities.
K. Maintain natural drainage patterns and encourage the use of natural
drainage systems.
L. Treat and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as
possible using a minimum of structures and maximizing reliance on
natural processes.
M. Maintain the existing water balance in all watersheds, sub-watersheds,
and streams in the Township, and protect and/or restore natural
hydrologic characteristics and habitats wherever possible throughout
the watershed systems.
N. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
O. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed sites undergoing
redevelopment while encouraging development and redevelopment in
urban areas and areas designated for growth.
P. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those
§ 266-1.2 HAMPTON CODE § 266-1.2
C:382
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in
"special protection" streams.

General Provisions
§ 266-2.1. Statutory authority.
§ 266-2.2. Applicability.
The standards contained herein shall apply to all regulated activities within
the Township. In addition, all local, county and state erosion and
sedimentation control approvals must be in place to proceed with any
regulated activity.
A. Primary authority: The Township of Hampton is empowered to regulate
these activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864
(Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Storm Water
Management Act, and Ordinance 673 of the Township of Hampton,
adopted on March 22, 2006.
B. Secondary authority: The Township also is empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
as amended.
(1) Erroneous permit. Any permit or authorization issued or approved
based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an
applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for
revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant to
such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be
taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
A. Activities regulated by this chapter include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(1) Land development and redevelopment.
(2) Subdivision.
(3) Construction of new or additional impervious or semipervious
surfaces (driveways, parking lots, etc.).
(4) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
(5) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
(6) Installation of stormwater management facilities or appurtenances
thereto.
(7) Any earth disturbances or any activities that involve the alteration
or development of land or removal of tree and vegetation in a
manner that may affect post-construction stormwater runoff.
§ 266-2.1 CHARTER § 266-2.2
C:385
§ 266-2.3. Exemptions.
B. Redevelopments shall conform to the requirements contained in
§ 266-4.1C(4), when more than a two-thousand-five-hundred-squarefoot
area of an existing facility is reconstructed, following the
demolition, or partial demolition of that facility. The area determination
shall be made using the footprint of the area being reconstructed,
including all impervious and semiimpervious surfaces proposed in the
reconstructed area and including the increased area of any parking lot
required to support the reconstructed facility. The area of the parking
lot required to support the reconstructed facility shall be determined
using the Township Zoning Ordinance requirements for parking.52 The
presence of existing impervious or semiimpervious surfaces in predeveloped
conditions does not justify a waiver of this provision.
A. With the approval of Township Council, the following activities may be
exempted from on-site stormwater runoff control. An exemption shall
apply only to the requirement for on-site stormwater facilities and the
preparation of a stormwater management plan. All other stormwater
management design elements, such as a storm sewer system, road
culverts, erosion and sedimentation control, and runoff quality, shall be
required. All exemption requests must be filed with the Township Land
Use Administrator and approved by the Engineer.
(1) Regulated activities smaller than 400 square feet are exempt from
the requirements of this chapter to implement SWM BMPs, unless
the activity is found to be a significant contributor to pollution of
the waters of this commonwealth.
(2) Small project exemption. Activities having a disturbed area of less
than 2,500 square feet are exempt from the peak rate control
requirements of this chapter. These projects shall still comply with
the water quality volume standards contained in § 266-4.1C(1) and
the extended detention requirement contained in § 266-4.1C(1). An
erosion and sedimentation control plan is required for all small
projects. The "Small Project standardized SWM Guidance"
document provided in Appendix F53 was prepared to assist
applicants in meeting this requirement for individual lots only. The
reduced site plan requirements contained in the "Small Project
Standardized SWM Guidance" document shall apply.
(3) Emergency exemption. Emergency maintenance work performed
for the protection of public health, safety and welfare may be
exempted from the requirements in this chapter to obtain approval
for a stormwater management plan before commencement of the
activity; however, a written description of the scope and extent of
any emergency work performed shall be submitted to the Township
within two calendar days of the commencement of the activity. If

§ 266-2.2 HAMPTON CODE § 266-2.3
C:386
the Township finds that the work is not an emergency, then the
work shall cease immediately and may not resume until a written
stormwater management plan is submitted and approved.
(4) Maintenance exemption. Any maintenance to an existing
stormwater management system made in accordance with plans
and specifications approved by the Engineer or the Township.
(5) Gardening. Use of land for gardening for home consumption.
(6) Agricultural activities. Agriculture when operated in accordance
with a conservation plan, nutrient management plan or erosion and
sedimentation control plan approved by the Allegheny County
Conservation District, including activities such as growing crops,
rotating crops, tilling of soil and grazing animals. Installation of
new or expansion of existing farmsteads, animal housing, waste
storage and production areas having impervious surfaces that
result in a net increase in impervious surface of less than 1,000
square feet are exempt from the requirement to submit a written
stormwater management plan.
(7) Forest management. Forest management operations, which are
consistent with a sound forest management plan as filed with the
Township Land Use Administrator and which follow the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's
management practices contained in its publication "Soil Erosion
and Sedimentation Control Guidelines for Forestry." Such
operations are required to have an erosion and sedimentation
control plan.
(8) If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the county or its
designee that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or
hardship as it applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate
design may result in a superior result within the context of Articles
I, IV, and V of this chapter, the county or its designee upon
obtaining the comments and recommendations of the Township and
the Allegheny County Conservation District and/or PADEP may
grant a waiver or relief so that substantial justice may be done and
the public interest is secured; provided that such waiver will not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter.
B. Waivers.
(1) The provisions of this chapter are the minimum standards for the
protection of the public health, safety, property, and welfare.
(2) No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may
be granted by the Township.
§ 266-2.3 CHARTER § 266-2.3
C:387
(3) Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may
be approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue
hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions
peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications will
not be contrary or detrimental to the public interest and will
achieve the intended outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter
is preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical
circumstances or conditions and not to circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter. Cost or financial
burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property.
(4) Applicants shall refer to the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual, Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP). No. 363-0300-002 (2006), as
amended and updated, or the Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual, Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) 363-2134-008 (2000), as amended
and updated, or other appropriate references for guidance in the
design of stormwater management facilities most appropriate to
individual site conditions. References to the Maryland Manual, if
not deleted, should be to specific sections of Maryland's manual in
order to minimize NPDES permitting conflicts with the guidance
provided by the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP Manual. The
applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions
of the chapter that are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief
that is necessary. The applicant shall state how the requested
waiver and how the applicant's proposal shall result in an equal or
better means of complying with the intent of Article I, Purpose, and
§ 266-4.1A, Design goals, and B, General principles, of this chapter.
(5) The applicant shall submit all waiver requests to Township Council
or its designee for review and approval. Copies of the waiver
request shall also be submitted to the Land Use Administrator. The
waiver must come from the applicant and be presented in writing
along with a stormwater management site plan. The Township shall
determine if the plan meets the requirements of this chapter,
including § 266-2.3B(3).
(6) The Township shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests.
(7) The Township will charge a fee of $1,000 for each waiver request,
which shall be used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing
the waiver request.
(8) In granting waivers, the Township Council or its designee may
impose reasonable conditions that will, in its judgment, secure
§ 266-2.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-2.3
C:388
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements that
are to be modified.
(9) The Township Council or its designee may grant applications for
waivers when the following findings are made:

exacerbated.
(e) That runoff is not being diverted to a different drainage area.
(f) That increased flooding or ponding on off-site properties or
roadways will not occur.
(g) That potential icing conditions will not occur.
(h) That increase of post-development peak flow from the site will
not occur and will, in fact, be reduced by the appropriate
amount if the site is in a subbasin having a release rate of less
than 100%.
(i) There will be no increase in the of the post-development total
runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the two-year/
twenty-four-hour storm event.
(j) That adverse impact to water quality will not result.
(k) That increased 100-year floodplain levels will not result.

sedimentation.
A. The management of stormwater on site, both during and upon
completion of the disturbances associated with activities permitted
under § 266-2.2, shall be accomplished in accordance with the
standards and criteria of this chapter. The design of any temporary or
permanent facilities and structures and the utilization of any natural
drainage systems shall be in full compliance with this article.
(1) The intent of these design standards is to encourage
environmentally sound stormwater management practices that
provide necessary drainage facilities while protecting the
hydrologic characteristics and water quality of the site and
watershed. Developments shall be required to incorporate
stormwater management controls. Stormwater management
design shall blend into the natural environment and be
aesthetically integrated into the site design.
B. Applicants shall refer to the Pennsylvania Storm Water Best
Management Practices Manual, as amended, Pennsylvania Handbook of
Best Management Practices for Developing areas (PACD, 1998), the
2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual (MDE, 2000) or other
appropriate references for guidance in the design of stormwater
management facilities most appropriate to individual site conditions.
Objectives for design are to reduce the volume of stormwater
generated, infiltrate runoff at its source to the maximum extent
possible, achieve water quality improvement at the source or during
conveyance, and provide for peak flow attenuation. Applicants shall
examine design alternatives by viewing them in a series. In addition,
applicants are strongly encouraged to use structural and nonstructural
stormwater management practices that reduce or eliminate the need
for detention basins.
C. All SWM design work must be completed by a qualified design
professional. All designs proposing the use of a SWM retention or
detention facility with outlet structure(s) shall be completed by a
professional engineer licensed in the state of Pennsylvania.
D. All development activity within a special flood hazard area designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall comply
with Floodplain Ordinance No. 76954 and this subsection. All
development shall be designed to maintain the flood-carrying capacity
of the floodway such that the base flood elevations are not increased,
either upstream or downstream, unless an approval is received from
PADEP. The natural conveyance characteristics of the site and the
54.Editor's Note: See Ch. 155, Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 266-2.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-2.4
C:390
receiving floodplain shall be incorporated into the stormwater
management practices proposed for the site.
E. The stormwater management system shall not create an adverse impact
on stormwater quantity or quality in either upstream or downstream
areas. Offsite areas which discharge to or across a site proposed for
development shall be addressed in the stormwater management plan
prepared for the development. No stormwater management plan shall
be approved until it is demonstrated that the runoff from the project
shall not adversely impact downstream areas.
F. Wetlands shall not be used to meet the minimum design requirements
for stormwater management or stormwater runoff quality treatment,
except when used as part of a treatment train that incorporates a
portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the wetland's riparian buffer as
a stormwater outfall.
G. All proposed stormwater management systems shall be designed to
prevent the pollution of groundwater resources by stormwater, promote
safety, minimize health hazards, preserve natural features and provide
infiltration and groundwater recharge where appropriate. Neither
submission of a plan under the provision herein nor compliance with
the provisions of these regulations shall relieve any person from
responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed
by law.
H. Where deemed necessary by the Engineer, or as addressed in an
approved Act 167 stormwater management plan, the applicant shall
construct storm drains to handle on-site runoff; to the maximum extent
permitted under the Municipalities Planning Code and Act 167, or any
amendments thereto, provide on-site/off-site drainage easements; and
provide for the conveyance of off-site runoff to an acceptable outlet in
the same watershed.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easements shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures, except as needed for roadways, driveways and walkways, or
any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within
any portions of the easement, and require the establishment and
protection of riparian buffers.
J. For all regulated activities, stormwater management BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under
Pennsylvania Code Title 25, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm
Water Management Act.
K. Any regulated activity that may affect the stormwater flows toward or
onto a state or county highway right-of-way or facility shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained in accordance with the
§ 266-2.4 CHARTER § 266-2.4
C:391
regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) or Allegheny County, as the case may be.
L. At the time of application for a building permit for any approved lot
created by a subdivision and/or improved as a land development
project, issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon adherence to
the terms of this chapter.
M. Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g.,
special protection waters, cold water fisheries, recharge areas, water
supply reservoirs, etc.) may be subject to additional performance
criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices.
N. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this
chapter and to meet all requirements under the Pennsylvania Code Title
25 and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design
standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual (E&S Manual), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Department of Environmental Protection, No. 363-2134-008, as
amended and updated.
O. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall

ARTICLE IV
Permanent Stormwater Management Design Standards
§ 266-4.1. Design goals, principles and standards.
A. Design goals. Applicants shall adhere to a holistic design process
incorporating the goals listed below. The objective is to achieve postdevelopment
hydrologic conditions that are consistent with the
predevelopment ground cover assumption for new development (refer
to § 266-4.2B) and improve the runoff conditions for redevelopment
[refer to § 266-4.1C(3)]. The design goals are:
(1) Minimize the volume of runoff that must be collected, conveyed,
treated and released by stormwater management facilities;
(2) Maintain the natural infiltration process and rate, and infiltrate
runoff at its source when appropriate;
(3) Remove and/or treat pollutants at the source or during conveyance;
(4) Provide for peak flow attenuation, as needed; and
(5) Attenuate runoff to protect the tributaries of the receiving stream.
B. General principles. The following general principles apply to all
applicable activities pursuant to § 266-2.2.
(1) Incorporate conservation design practices to minimize the amount
of stormwater generated on a site, encourage the disconnection of
impervious land cover, and maximize the use of pervious areas for
stormwater treatment and on-site rainfall infiltration.
(2) Infiltration of surface water runoff at its source is to be a
mechanism for stormwater management based on hydrologic soil
group (or infiltration testing). Infiltration practices include, but are
not limited to, those referenced in § 266-4.3B(2)(a) and as outlined
in the publications listed in § 266-4.3. Infiltration practices shall
adhere to the following criteria:
(a) In choosing methods of infiltration, preference shall be given to
a combination of surface and subsurface infiltration methods.
(b) Applicants shall first consider minimum disturbance/minimum
maintenance techniques combined with site grading that
distributes runoff to reduce concentration. Next, applicants
shall consider depression areas combined with subsurface
infiltration practices followed by other subsurface measures,
including, but not limited to, porous paving and perforated
pipe storage.
(c) The use of multiple infiltration features and facilities that
provide for the following is encouraged:
§ 266-4.1 CHARTER § 266-4.1
C:403
[1] Discourage concentration of flows;
[2] Encourage disconnection of flows;
[3] Infiltrate as close to the source of runoff as possible; and
[4] Reduce visual impact.
(d) Where high water tables, subsurface contamination, slope
stability concerns, or other site constraints preclude achieving
the required infiltration volume, additional conservation
design practices and alternative stormwater management
practices should be implemented to reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the total volume of stormwater released to
streams. Applicant shall follow the stormwater runoff
hierarchy of § 266-4.3B(1)(a).
(e) Infiltration areas should be designed to maintain a broad and
even infiltration pattern which existed prior to development.
Such facilities should use the natural topography and
vegetation in order to blend in with the site. Infiltration
designs, which do not provide this may be used if the applicant
demonstrates to the Township's satisfaction that alternative
approaches would be more effective and more harmonious
with their existing environment and as easily maintained.
(f) Aboveground stormwater infiltration facilities should be as
shallow as possible while still achieving the requirements of
this chapter.
(g) A written justification statement must be prepared if proposed
BMPs other than green infrastructure or low-impact
development practices are being used to achieve volume, rate,
and water quality controls.
(3) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with or
as part of infiltration practices. Water quality improvements shall
also be provided for drainage areas not otherwise addressed by
infiltration practices either at the source of runoff and/or during
conveyance away from the source of runoff.
(4) To reduce the need for large retention and/or detention basins
designed to satisfy the peak flow attenuation and extended
detention requirements, other innovative stormwater management
practices located close to the source of runoff generation shall be
considered, including a combination of practices (e.g., rooftop
storage, open vegetated channels, bioretention, pervious pavement
systems and infiltration trenches).
(5) When designing stormwater management facilities to satisfy the
peak flow attenuation and extended detention requirements [refer
to § 266-4.1C(2)(b)], the effect of structural and nonstructural
§ 266-4.1 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.1
C:404
stormwater management practices implemented as part of the
overall site design may be taken into consideration when
calculating total storage volume and release rates.
(6) Site hydrology and natural infiltration patterns shall guide site
design, construction and vegetation decisions. All channels,
drainageways, swales, natural streams and other surface water
concentrations shall be considered and where possible
incorporated into design decisions.
C. Minimum performance criteria.
(1) The following minimum rate control performance standards shall
apply to all applicable regulated activities, whether they are new
development or redevelopment, pursuant to § 266-2.2A.
(a) Water quality treatment of stormwater runoff shall be provided
for all discharges prior to release to a receiving water body. If a
stormwater management practice does not provide water
quality treatment, then water quality best management
practices shall be utilized prior to the runoff entering the
stormwater management practice.
(b) Water quality management shall be provided through the use
of structural and/or nonstructural stormwater management
practices. Water quality stormwater management practices
shall be designed to reduce or eliminate solids, sediment,
nutrients, and other potential pollutants from the site. It is
presumed that a stormwater management practice complies
with this requirement if it is:
[1] Designed according to the specific performance criteria
outlined in § 266-2.4B;
[2] Constructed in accordance with all permits and approved
plans and specifications; and
[3] Maintained per an approved operation and maintenance
plan or agreement or, in lieu of that, in accordance with
customary practices.
(c) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential for pollutant loadings (hotspots) may require the use
of specific structural stormwater management practices and
pollution prevention practices. In addition, stormwater from a
hotspot land use shall be provided with proper pretreatment
prior to infiltration. For the purpose of this chapter, the sites/
facilities listed in § 266-4.1C(1)(d), below, are considered
hotspots.
(d) Certain industrial sites may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file
§ 266-4.1 CHARTER § 266-4.1
C:405
notice of intent as required under the provision of the EPA
Industrial Stormwater NPDES Permit Requirements. Other
industrial sites storing significant quantities of chemicals/
wastes should also prepare a prevention plan. Sites that are
required by EPA to prepare a plan include, but are not limited
to:
[1] Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities;
[2] Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities;
[3] Fleet storage areas for buses, trucks, etc.;
[4] Marinas (service and maintenance);
[5] Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(e) Conveyance structures/channels shall be designed and
adequately sized so as to protect the properties receiving
runoff from impacts of flooding and erosion. Where necessary,
and to the maximum extent permitted under the Municipalities
Planning Code and Act 167, or any amendments thereto,
drainage easement from adjoining properties shall be obtained
to ensure the drainageway and the property and shall also
establish the operation and maintenance requirements for the
drainageway.
(f) All stormwater management practices shall have an operation
and maintenance plan pursuant to § 266-5.3 of this chapter,
and if to be privately owned, an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement per § 266-5.4 of this chapter to ensure
the system functions as designed and to provide remedies for
system failure. A draft of that agreement may be found in
Appendix C of this chapter.57
(g) Stormwater runoff generated from development and
discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of
the United States and their adjacent wetlands shall be treated
by an approved stormwater management practice prior to
release into a natural wetlands and shall not be used to meet
the minimum design requirements for stormwater
management or stormwater runoff quality treatment, except
when used as part of a treatment train that incorporates a
portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the wetland's riparian
buffer as a stormwater outfall. In such instances, the discharge
velocity from the terminal end of a pipe or associated energy
dissipation practice shall not exceed two feet per second for
the two-year frequency storm event. Where such a
management strategy is used, all feasible methods shall be
used to convert concentrated flow to uniform, shallow sheet
57.Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Township offices.
§ 266-4.1 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.1
C:406
flow before entering the outer zone of the wetland's riparian
buffer. In addition, it shall be demonstrated that such an
approach will not cause erosion.
(2) The following minimum volume control performance standards
shall apply to all applicable regulated activities, whether they are
new development or redevelopment, pursuant to § 266-2.2A. The
following green infrastructure and low-impact development
practices provided in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume
controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection C(2)(a) or the Simplified Method in Subsection C(2)(b)
below, or alternative design criteria as allowed by PA Code Title 25,
Chapter 102.
(a) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is
applicable as a method to any size of regulated activity. This
method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
The following shall be incorporated into the CG-1 method:
[1] Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twentyfour-
hour duration precipitation.
[2] At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from
the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface
waters of this commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the
developer provides justification that the listed removal
options are not feasible, and the Township agrees, runoff
shall be detained in a facility designed for a twenty-four- to
seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area with a
dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a
combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility
designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before
discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
[3] For modeling purposes:
[a] Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow in good condition.
[b] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow in good
condition in the model for existing conditions.
(b) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided
below is independent of site conditions and should be used if
the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for
§ 266-4.1 CHARTER § 266-4.1
C:407
projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities.
For new impervious surfaces:
[1] Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious
surfaces.
[2] At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from
the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface
waters of this commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the
developer provides justification that the listed removal
options are not feasible, and the designated plan reviewer
agrees, runoff shall be detained in a facility designed for a
twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area with a
dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a
combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility
designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before
discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
[3] Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be
designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire
permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least
the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated.
(3) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable new development activities, pursuant to § 266-2.2A.
(a) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction
with or as part of infiltration practices (if used). Water quality
improvements shall also be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff
generated by the one-inch rainfall event. Refer to
§ 266-4.3B(1)(b) for water quality volume design standards and
assumptions. Stormwater quality management practice
selection, design and implementation shall be based upon
appropriate reference materials, as provided in § 266-2.4B.
(b) The post development peak discharge rate shall not exceed the
predevelopment peak discharge rate multiplied by the
"subbasin release rate percentage" (where determined in Act
167 watersheds) for the one-year, two-year, five-year, ten-year,
twenty-five-year, fifty-year, and 100-year twenty-four-hour
storm events pursuant to the predevelopment cover

assumption described in § 266-4.2B. Refer to Appendix A for
release rate percentages information.58
(c) Facilities capable of attenuating rainfall runoff shall be
provided and be designed to attenuate the runoff volume from
the two-year twenty-four-hour storm event for at least 24
hours.
(d) Stormwater shall be infiltrated and/or discharged within the
same drainage area of the stream receiving the runoff from the
development site prior to development.
(e) Structural and nonstructural stormwater management
practices that make best possible use of infiltration on-site
shall be considered in all site designs, when appropriate.
(4) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable redevelopment activities, pursuant to § 266-2.2B.
(a) One of the following minimum performance standards shall be
accomplished. Selection of the performance standard shall be
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions:
[1] Reduce the total impervious cover on the site (e.g., by
replacement of pavement with pervious planting areas or
green roof systems) by at least 25%, based on a
comparison of existing impervious cover to proposed
impervious cover; or
[2] Provide facilities designed to attenuate the runoff volume
from the one-year twenty-four-hour post development
storm event for at least 24 hours (a predevelopment cover
CN of 71 and a time of concentration of not less than 10
minutes shall be assumed); or
[3] Provide facilities to insure that the post-development peak
discharge rate shall not exceed the predevelopment peak
discharge rate multiplied by the "subbasin release rate
percentage" (where determined in Act 167 watersheds) for
the two-year and ten-year twenty-four-hour storm events
(a predevelopment cover CN of 71 and a time of
concentration of not less than 10 minutes shall be
assumed).
(b) In addition to the minimum performance standards for
redevelopment areas in § 266-4.1C(4) above, water quality
improvements shall be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management facilities

In addition to the infiltration and water quality requirements of this chapter,
peak flow from those activities resulting in increases in impervious surface
and/or regrading and compaction shall be attenuated consistent with the
following stormwater calculation methods:
shall be designed to capture and treat 1/4 of one inch of runoff
from all pavement areas (i.e., parking lots, pavements and
noncovered sidewalks). Roof area may be excluded from this

(NOAA October 2018). The NOAA data is available from the
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center of the National
Weather Service.
B. The following assumptions shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For new development sites, the ground cover used as the
predevelopment assumption for runoff calculations shall be as
follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of woodland in good
condition. Portions of a site having more than one viable tree of
a DBH [diameter at breast height (DBH) is the diameter of the
tree stem 4 1/2 feet above the ground] of six inches or greater
per 1,500 square feet shall be considered wooded where such
trees existed within 10 years of application. If there is evidence
of logging within the ten-year period, logged area shall be
consider as woodland in good condition.
§ 266-4.1 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.2
C:410
(b) Agricultural sites shall use a ground cover of pasture in good
condition.
(c) All other portions of a site shall use a ground cover of meadow
in good condition.
(d) All watershed area(s) contributing to the point of interest
including off-site area shall be considered.
(e) For redevelopment sites, see § 266-4.1C(4).
(f) The runoff curve numbers listed in the table below shall be
used in developing the runoff calculations for the ground
covers noted in § 266-4.2B(1). These values are referenced
from the Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds Technical
Release No. 55 (USDA, 1986). Coefficients for equivalent
ground cover conditions shall be used if a runoff method other
than the Soil Cover Complex Method is used.

Woodland 30 55 70 77
Meadow 30 58 71 78

(2) For new development sites, the ground cover used for
postdevelopment conditions for runoff calculations shall be as
follows:
(a) Impervious cover shall have a curve number of 98.
(b) Gravel pavement shall have a curve number of 89.
(c) All new grass and lawn areas that are to be graded or
disturbed shall have a curve number of 80.
(3) Average antecedent moisture conditions, or AMC II, shall be used
(for the Soil Cover Complex Method only for example, TR-55,
TR-20).
(4) A type II distribution storm (for the Soil Cover Complex Method
only for example, TR-55, TR-20).
(5) For time of concentration calculations, sheet flow lengths shall not
exceed 100 feet and shallow concentrated flow lengths shall not
exceed 1,000 feet.
(6) The kinematic "n" value in the sheet flow equation should be
applied as per the following table. (Values taken from TR-55)

Grass, lawn, or open space 0.24
Wooded areas 0.40
C. In all plans and designs for stormwater management systems and
facilities submitted to the Engineer for approval, stormwater peak
discharge and runoff shall be determined through the use of the NRCS
Soil Cover Complex Method as set forth in Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (USDA, 1986), with specific
attention given to antecedent moisture conditions, flood routing, time of
concentration, and peak discharge specifications included therein and
in Hydrology National Engineering Handbook, Section 4, (USDA, 1985)
both by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service. Note that when TR-55 is used for natural systembased
approaches and practices encouraged herein, calculations must
be performed on a detailed small sub-area basis. Use of Technical
Release No. 20 and other methods listed in Table 1 are also acceptable.
The design professional's selection of a specific method shall be based
on the suitability of the method for the given project site conditions with
due consideration to the limitations of the method chosen. Table 1
herein summarizes the computational methods available.
D. An impervious area flash (IAF) analysis shall be conducted for all sites
and regulated activities. The analysis requires that the site and/or
watershed impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas
within the site and/or watershed. The time of concentration for the
watershed should also be determined from the impervious areas only. If
the IAF results in a higher post-development peak runoff rate than the
post-development watershed analysis, then this higher value must be
used for the final design of the stormwater management facility.

Calculation of runoff
volume from urban
and suburban areas
E. A Modified Rational Method analysis may be used for drainage areas
and/or development sites smaller than one acre when permitted by the
Engineer. The term "Modified Rational Method" used herein refers to a
procedure for manipulation of the basic rational method techniques to
reflect the fact that storms with durations greater than the normal time
of concentration for a basin will result in a larger volume of runoff even
though the peak discharge is reduced. The methodology and model
chosen for use shall be well documented as being appropriate for use in
this region, and all relevant assumptions, methodologies, calculations
and data used shall be provided to the Engineer for review. Information
on the Modified Rational Method is presented in the Recommended
Hydrologic Procedures for Computing Urban Runoff from Small
Watersheds in Pennsylvania (PADEP, 1982).
F. Rainfall intensities used for the Modified Rational Method shall be
based on the precipitation frequency estimates developed by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as set forth in NOAA
Atlas 14.
G. The Rational Method (that is, Q = CIA) shall be used for calculations of
the peak rate of runoff for the design of storm sewers and drainage
swales but not for the design of stormwater management facilities
where a full hydrograph is needed. The equation representing the
Rational Method is comprised of the following (in English units):
Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (CFS)
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover
I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour

§ 266-4.3. Standards for stormwater management practices.
A = Drainage area, acres.
H. Runoff characteristics of off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development shall be considered and be based on the existing
conditions in the off-site area.
I. The amount of impervious area assumed for a new development lot
must be labeled in the stormwater management report and appear on
the construction drawings.
A. The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual shall
serve as a guide for the design of stormwater management practices.
Additional design guidance may also be obtained from other related
sources, including the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual,
Volumes I and II (MDE, 2000), Design of Stormwater Filtering Systems
(CWP, 1996), and the American Society of Civil Engineers Manual and
Report on Engineering Practice, No. 87, Urban Runoff Quality
Management (ASCE, 1998) for the design of stormwater runoff quality
control features for site development. A list of references is provided
with this chapter. The water quality volume design measures used
herein are partially based on the methodology expressed in the
Maryland manual referenced above.
B. Pursuant to the design options recommended in the above documents,
the following standards shall be adhered to:
(1) Extended detention, water quality volume, infiltration and
nonstructural BMP credits criteria. The following sizing criteria
shall be followed at all sites required to meet the standards of this
chapter.
(a) Extended detention.
[1] Detain the two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm using
the SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made so
that the two-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to
drain from the facility from a point where the maximum
volume of water from the two-year storm is captured, (i.e.,
the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the
storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the
invert of the facility). The design of the facility shall
consider and minimize the chances of clogging and
sedimentation potential.
[2] Detention basins shall detain the two-year storm event and
allow it to naturally infiltrate and recharge the
groundwater table if possible. All subsequent orifices and
control structures for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-,
§ 266-4.2 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:414
fifty- and 100-year storm events shall be placed above the
maximum water surface elevation of the two-year storm.
[3] Flow from off-site areas must be considered as passthrough
flow if it is conveyed through the BMP and should
be modeled as "pre-developed conditions" for the two-year
storm event only.
(b) Water quality volume.
[1] Treatment of the water quality volume (WQv) of
stormwater prior to its release to receiving waters or
water bodies shall be provided at all developments where
stormwater management is required. The WQv equals the
storage volume needed to capture and treat the runoff
from storms of one inch or less. Runoff from the first one
inch of rainfall transports most of the total pollutant load.
[a] The WQv is based on the following equation:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12 (acre-feet)
Where:
P = rainfall depth in inches (set to 1 inch)
Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient, 0.05 +
0.009(I) where I is percent impervious
cover
A = site area (acres)
[2] The formula assumes approximately 5% runoff from
pervious surfaces, and 90% runoff from impervious
surfaces. A minimum of 0.2 inches per acre of runoff
volume shall be met at sites or in drainage areas that have
less than 15% impervious cover.
[3] Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no
proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations. However, designers
are encouraged to incorporate water quality treatment
practices for these areas.
[4] Stormwater Quality Treatment: The final WQv shall be
treated by an acceptable stormwater management
practice(s) from those described in this section or as
approved by the Township.
[5] For new developments and redevelopments, infiltration is
considered an acceptable method of satisfying part or all
of the water quality volume.
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:415
[6] For new developments, the WQv requirements of this
section shall be sized and designed in conjunction with the
standards under § 266-43B(1)(a).
[7] As a basis for design, the following assumptions may be
made:
[a] Multiple Drainage Areas: When a project contains or
is divided by multiple drainage areas, the WQv volume
shall be addressed for each drainage area.
[b] Offsite Drainage Areas: The WQv shall be based on the
impervious cover of the proposed site. Offsite existing
impervious areas may be excluded from the
calculation of the water quality volume requirements.
(c) Infiltration volume. Where possible, all of the water quality
volume should be treated using infiltration BMPs. The
following calculation shall be used to determine the minimum
recharge goal for the site.
Recharge Volume (Rev), (acre-feet)
Fraction of WQv, depending on soil hydrologic group.
Rev = (S)(Ai) Where; S = soil specific recharge factor in
inches
Ai = the measured impervious cover
Hydrologic Soil Group
Soil Specific Recharge
Factor (S)
A 0.40 inches of runoff
B 0.25 inches of runoff
C 0.10 inches of runoff
D 0.05 inches of runoff
[1] Infiltrated volume may be subtracted from the total site
WQv.
[2] Infiltration should not be considered for sites or areas of
sites that have activities that may allow pollution to be
infiltrated. For example the use of infiltration for the runoff
of a service stations paved lot would not be appropriate,
although roof water from the service station may be
infiltrated.
[3] Infiltration should only be used when in the opinion of a
professional engineer it will not contribute to slope
instability or cause seepage problems into basements or
developed down-gradient areas.
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:416
[4] If more than one hydrologic soil group is present at a site,
a composite recharge volume shall be computed based
upon the proportion of total site area within each
hydrologic soil group.
[5] All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 20 feet
from all structures with subgrade elements (e.g.,
basements, foundation walls).
[6] All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 20 feet
from all property lines and road rights-of-way.
[7] A detailed, onsite infiltration test is required at the
location of all infiltration BMPs. Testing must be
performed following the methods described in Appendix C
of the Pennsylvania BMP Manual. See § 266-4.3B(2) for
additional information and requirements for infiltration
BMPs.
(d) Credits for use of nonstructural BMPs. The developer may
obtain credits for the use of nonstructural BMPs using the
procedures outlined below. Examples of nonstructural credit
calculations are provided in Appendix E.59
Volume Reduction Method #1: Natural Area
Conservation
A water quality volume reduction can be taken when
undisturbed natural areas are conserved on a site, thereby
retaining their pre-development hydrologic and water quality
characteristics. Under this method, a designer would be able
to subtract the conservation areas from the total site area
when computing the water quality protection volume. An
added benefit is that the post-development peak discharges
will be smaller, and hence, water quantity control volumes will
be reduced due to lower post-development curve numbers or
rational formula "C" values.
Rule: Subtract conservation areas from total site area
when computing water quality protection volume
requirements.
Criteria:
 Conservation area cannot be disturbed during project
construction and must be protected from sediment
deposition. The conservation area shall be protected
with a safety fence until construction has been
completed. After construction the area shall be posted
with signage indicating that it is a conservation area.
59.Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Township offices.
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:417
 Shall be protected by limits of disturbance clearly
shown on all construction drawings.
 Shall be located within an acceptable conservation
easement instrument that ensures perpetual protection
of the proposed area. The easement must clearly specify
how the natural area vegetation shall be managed and
boundaries will be marked. [Note: managed turf (e.g.,
playgrounds, regularly maintained open areas) is not an
acceptable form of vegetation management.]
 Shall have a minimum contiguous area requirement of
10,000 square feet.
 Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
 Must be forested or have a stable, natural ground cover.
Volume Reduction Method #2: Stream Buffers
This reduction can be taken when a stream buffer effectively
treats storm water runoff. Effective treatment constitutes
treating runoff through overland flow in a naturally vegetated
or forested buffer. Under the proposed method, a designer
would be able to subtract areas draining via overland flow to
the buffer from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements. The design of the stream
buffer treatment system must use appropriate methods for
conveying flows above the annual recurrence (two-year storm)
event.
Rule: Subtract areas draining via overland flow to the
buffer from total site area when computing water
quality protection volume requirements.
Criteria:
 The minimum undisturbed buffer width shall be 50 feet
from top of bank.
 The maximum contributing length shall be 150 feet for
pervious surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces.
 The average contributing slope shall be 3% maximum
unless a flow spreader is used. In no case shall the
average contributing slope be greater than 10%.
 Runoff shall enter the buffer as overland sheet flow. A
flow spreader can be installed to ensure this.
 Buffers shall remain as naturally vegetated or forested
areas and will require only routine debris removal or
erosion repairs.
 Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
 Not applicable if overland flow filtration/groundwater
recharge reduction is already being taken.
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:418
Volume Reduction Method #3: Enhanced Swales
This reduction may be taken when enhanced swales are used
for water quality protection. Under the proposed method, a
designer would be able to subtract the areas draining to an
enhanced swale from total site area when computing water
quality protection volume requirements. An enhanced swale
can fully meet the water quality protection volume
requirements for certain kinds of low-density residential
development (see Volume Reduction Method #5). An added
benefit is the post-development peak discharges will likely be
lower due to a longer time of concentration for the site.
Rule: Subtract the areas draining to an enhanced swale
from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements.
Criteria:
 This method is typically only applicable to moderate- or
low-density residential land uses (three dwelling units
per acre maximum).
 The maximum flow velocity for water quality design
storm shall be less than or equal to 1.0 feet per second.
 The minimum residence time for the water quality
storm shall be five minutes.
 The bottom width shall be a maximum of six feet. If
a larger channel is needed, use of a compound cross
section is required.
 The side slopes shall be 3:1 (horizontal:vertical) or
flatter.
 The channel slope shall be 3% or less.
 Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
Volume Reduction Method #4: Overland Flow Filtration/
Groundwater Recharge Zones
This reduction can be taken when "overland flow filtration/
infiltration zones" are incorporated into the site design to
receive runoff from rooftops or other small impervious areas
(e.g., driveways, small parking lots, etc.). This can be achieved
by grading the site to promote overland vegetative filtering or
by providing infiltration or "rain garden" areas. If impervious
areas are adequately disconnected, they can be deducted
from total site area when computing the water quality
protection volume requirements. An added benefit will be that
the post-development peak discharges will likely be lower due
to a longer time of concentration for the site.
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:419
Rule: If impervious areas are adequately disconnected,
they can be deducted from total site area when
computing the water quality protection volume
requirements.
Criteria:
 Relatively permeable soils (hydrologic soil groups A and
B) should be present.
 Runoff shall not come from a designated hotspot.
 The maximum contributing impervious flow path length
shall be 75 feet.
 Downspouts shall be at least 10 feet away from the
nearest impervious surface to discourage
reconnections.
 The disconnection shall drain continuously through a
vegetated channel, swale, or filter strip to the property
line or structural storm water control.
 The length of the disconnection shall be equal to or
greater than the contributing length.
 The entire vegetative disconnection shall be on a slope
less than or equal to 3%.
 The surface impervious area tributary to any one
discharge location shall not exceed 5,000 square feet.
 For those areas draining directly to a buffer, reduction
can be obtained from either overland flow filtration or
stream buffers (see Method #2).
 Rv is kept constant when calculating WOv.
Volume Reduction Method #5: Environmentally
Sensitive Large Lot Subdivisions
This reduction can be taken when a group of environmental
site design techniques are applied to low- and very-lowdensity
residential development (e.g., one dwelling unit per
two acres [du/ac] or lower). The use of this method can
eliminate the need for structural storm water controls to treat
water quality protection volume requirements. This method
is targeted towards large lot subdivisions and will likely have
limited application:
Rule: Targeted towards large lot subdivisions (e.g., twoacre
lots and greater). The requirement for structural
facilities to treat the water quality protection volume
may be waived.
Criteria:
For Single Lot Development:
 Total site impervious cover is less than 15%.
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:420
 Lot size shall be at least two acres.
 Rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with
the criteria in Method #4.
 Grass channels are used to convey runoff versus curb
and gutter.
For Multiple Lots:
 Total impervious cover footprint shall be less than
15% of the area.
 Lot areas should be at least two acres, unless
clustering is implemented. Open space developments
should have a minimum of 25% of the site protected
as natural conservation areas and shall be at least a
half-acre average individual lot size.
 Grass channels should be used to convey runoff
versus curb and gutter (see Method # 3).
 Overland flow filtration/infiltration zones should be
established (see Method # 4).
(2) Stormwater infiltration practices.
(a) In selecting the appropriate infiltration BMPs, the applicant
shall consider the following:
[1] Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
[2] Slope and depth to bedrock.
[3] Seasonal high water table.
[4] Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
[5] Erodibility of soils.
[6] Land availability and topography.
[7] Slope stability.
[8] Effects on nearby properties and structures.
(b) The loading ratio of impervious surface to infiltration bed
bottom size must be considered in all designs. The loading
ratio describes the ratio of impervious drainage area to
infiltration area, or the ratio of total drainage area to
infiltration area.
[1] The following loading ratios may not be exceeded:
[a] Maximum impervious loading ratio of 5:1 relating
impervious drainage area to infiltration area.
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:421
[b] Maximum total loading ratio of 8:1 relating total
drainage area to infiltration area.
[c] Maximum impervious loading ratio of 3:1 relating
impervious drainage area to infiltration area for Karst
topography.
[2] In order to attempt to exceed any of these values, a
detailed geotechnical analysis prepared by a licensed
geotechnical engineer will be required to determine the
overall effects to downstream properties should the
loading ratios be exceeded. The Township Engineer will
review this analysis and render an opinion on the viability
of the proposed design.
(c) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be
performed to determine the suitability of infiltration BMPs. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified professional, and
at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock and
slope stability. The general process for designing the
infiltration BMP shall be:
[1] Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the watershed to determine general
areas of suitability for infiltration BMPs.
[2] Provide field testing data to determine appropriate
percolation rate and/or hydraulic connectivity. All testing
should be done following the methods listed in the PA
Stormwater BMP Manual Appendix C.
[3] Design infiltration BMPs for required stormwater volume
based on field-determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface.
[4] Provide evaluation of the effect of the infiltration on the
adjacent downstream property(s).
(d) Soil characteristics, as subject to the specific considerations
below:
[1] Infiltration BMPs are particularly appropriate in
hydrologic soil groups A and B, as described in the Natural
Resources Conservation Manual TR-55.
[2] Low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) are preferred for the
construction of basins.
[3] There must be a minimum depth of 48 inches between the
bottom of any facility and the seasonal high water table
and/or bedrock (limiting zones), except for infiltration
BMPs receiving only roof runoff which shall be placed in
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:422
soils having a minimum depth of 24 inches between the
bottom of the facility and the limiting zone.
[4] There must be an infiltration and/or percolation rate
sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load, and to
drain completely as determined by field tests.
[5] The infiltration system shall have positive overflow
controls to prevent storage within one foot of the finished
surface or grade.
[6] Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the
storage volume of the infiltration system.
(e) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge
of sediment into the infiltration system.
(f) The recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to
the most permeable hydrologic soil group available, except
where other considerations apply such as in limestone geology.
(g) Any infiltration BMP shall be capable of completely infiltrating
the impounded water within 48 hours.
(h) The Township may require additional analyses for stormwater
management facilities proposed for susceptible areas such as:
[1] Strip mines.
[2] Storage areas for salt, chloride, other materials for winter
deicing.
[3] Unstable and steep slopes.
(i) During the period of land disturbance, runoff shall be
controlled prior to entering any proposed infiltration area.
Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase,
so as to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(j) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff
until the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration
BMP has received final stabilization.
(k) Infiltration facilities shall be selected based on suitability of
soils and site conditions. Acceptable infiltration facilities
include, but are not limited to: filter strips or stormwater
filtering systems (for example bioretention facilities, sand
filters), open vegetated channels (that is, dry swales and wet
swales), infiltration trenches, dry wells, infiltration basins,
porous paving systems, retention basins, wet extended
detention ponds, riparian corridor management, riparian
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:423
forested buffers, rooftop runoff management systems, and
sand filters (closed or open).
(l) Where sediment transport in the stormwater runoff is
anticipated to reach the infiltration system, appropriate
permanent measures to prevent or collect sediment shall be
installed prior to discharge to the infiltration system.
(m) All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 20 feet from
all structures with subgrade elements (e.g., basements,
foundation walls).
(n) All infiltration facilities that serve more than one lot and are
considered a common facility shall have a private drainage
easement. The easement shall provide to the Township the
right of access.
(o) If detailed infiltration study is required, the following guidance
shall be followed:
[1] Soil evaluations shall be performed to determine the
feasibility and extent to which infiltration systems can be
used. The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified,
licensed geologist, geotechnical/civil engineer or soil
scientist and, at a minimum, address soil types, soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, limitations of soils,
presence/absence of carbonate geology susceptibility to
subsidence and/or sinkhole formation and subgrade
stability. The testing and evaluation should be completed
at the preliminary design stage.
[2] Infiltration requirements shall be based on the portions of
the site that are permeable prior to disturbance and the
degree to which development will reduce the permeability
of the site. Permeability of the site shall be determined
based on the detailed evaluations described herein. Use of
stormwater management facilities to retain stormwater for
infiltration should be applied to all areas where the soils
evaluation indicates favorable conditions. Areas generally
not favorable for infiltration shall still be provided with an
appropriate water quality practice.
[3] Soil infiltration tests shall be performed to an equivalent
depth or elevation of the bottom of the proposed
infiltration areas. These tests shall follow the procedures
of Appendix C, Site Evaluation and Soil Testing, in the PA
Stormwater BMP Manual.
[4] The testing shall include a test pit and percolation test
holes. The test hole shall be excavated to a depth so that
the presence or absence of bedrock and/or seasonal high
water table can be determined. A soil log describing the
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:424
soils present in each test pit shall be performed. All test
holes used for evaluating the percolation rate shall be
presoaked in accordance with the procedures established
by the ACHD. The location and number of test pits and
percolation holes shall be determined based on the type(s)
of stormwater management facilities being designed.
Acceptability of infiltration rates shall be based on sound
engineering judgment and recommended design
considerations described in the design manuals listed in
the references or other source material acceptable to the
Engineer.
(p) The following design and construction standards shall be
followed when planning and constructing infiltration BMPs.
[1] The lowest elevation of the infiltration area shall be at
least two feet above the seasonal high water table and
bedrock.
[2] Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration
facilities, they shall have appropriate measures to prevent
clogging by unwanted debris (for example, silt, leaves and
vegetation). Such measures shall include, but are not
limited to, leaf traps, gutter guards and cleanouts.
[3] All infiltration facilities shall have appropriate positive
overflow controls to prevent storage within one foot of the
finished surface or grade, unless a specific amount of
surface storage away from pedestrian and vehicular traffic
is provided and such areas infiltrate the stored volume
within 48 hours after the end of the twenty-four-hour
design storm.
[4] All infiltration facilities shall be designed to infiltrate the
stored volume within 48 hours after the end of the twentyfour-
hour design storm.
[5] All surface inflows shall be treated to prevent the direct
discharge of sediment into the infiltration facility.
Accumulated sediment reduces stormwater storage
capacity and ultimately clogs the infiltration mechanism.
No sand, salt or other particulate matter may be applied to
a porous (pervious) surface for winter ice conditions.
[6] During site construction, all infiltration practice
components shall be protected from compaction due to
heavy equipment operation or storage of fill or
construction material. Infiltration areas shall also be
protected from sedimentation. Areas that are accidentally
compacted or graded shall be remediated to restore soil
composition and porosity. Adequate documentation to this
effect shall be submitted for review by the Engineer. All
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:425
areas designated for infiltration shall not receive runoff
until the contributory drainage area has achieved final
stabilization.
[7] The following procedures and materials shall be required
during the construction of all subsurface facilities:
[a] Excavation for the infiltration facility shall be
performed with equipment that will not compact the
bottom of the seepage bed/trench or like facility.
[b] The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified
prior to the placement of aggregate.
[c] Only clean aggregate with documented porosity, free
of fines, shall be allowed.
[d] The tops and sides of all seepage beds, trenches, or
like facilities shall be covered with drainage fabric.
Fabric shall meet the specifications of PennDOT
Publication 408, Section 735, Construction Class 1.
[e] Perforated distribution pipes connected to centralized
catch basins and/or manholes with the provision for
the collection of debris shall be provided in all
facilities. Where perforated pipes are used to
distribute stormwater to the infiltration practice,
stormwater shall be distributed uniformly throughout
the entire seepage bed/trench or like facility.
(3) Open vegetated channels.
(a) Open vegetated channels are conveyance systems that are
engineered to also perform as water quality and infiltration
facilities. Such systems can be used for the conveyance,
retention, infiltration, and filtration of stormwater runoff.
(b) Open vegetated channels primarily serve a water quality
function (WQv); they also have the potential to augment
infiltration. Examples of such systems include, but are not
limited to: dry swales, wet swales, grass channels, and
biofilters. Open vegetated channels are primarily applicable
for land uses such as roads, highways, residential
developments (dry swales only) and pervious areas.
(c) Open vegetated channels shall be designed to meet the
following minimum standards:
[1] The channel shall be designed to safely convey the tenyear
frequency storm event with a freeboard of at least 12
inches. Freeboard is the difference between the elevation
of the design flow in the channel and the top elevation of
the channel.
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:426
[2] The peak velocity of the runoff from the ten-year storm
shall be nonerosive for the soil and ground cover provided
in the channel.
[3] The longitudinal slope shall be no greater than 4%.
[4] Channels shall be trapezoidal in cross section.
[5] Channels shall be designed with moderate side slopes of
four horizontal to one vertical. Flatter side slopes may be
necessary under certain circumstances.
[6] The maximum allowable ponding time in the channel shall
be less than 48 hours.
[7] Channels (for example, dry swales) may require an
underdrain in order to function and dewater.
[8] Channels shall be designed to temporarily store the WQv
within the system for a maximum period of 48 hours and a
minimum period of one hour.
[9] Landscape specifications shall address the grass species,
wetland plantings (if applicable), soil amendment and
hydric conditions present along the channel.
[10] Accumulated sediment within the channel bottom shall be
removed when 25% of the original WQv volume has been
exceeded. The channel shall be provided with a permanent
concrete cleanout marker that indicates the 25% loss
level.
[11] Check dams along the channel length may be warranted.
[12] The bottom of dry swales shall be situated at least two feet
above the seasonal high water table.

(4) Retention basins.
(a) Retention basins shall be designed to create a healthy
ecological community with sufficient circulation of water to
prevent the growth of unwanted vegetation and mosquitoes or
other vectors. If circulation cannot be provided via natural
means, then artificial aeration and circulation shall be
provided. Care shall be taken to landscape retention basins in
accordance with § 266-4.4.
(b) The retention basin shall be of sufficient size to allow the
appropriate aquatic community needed to maintain healthy
pond ecology and avoid mosquitoes capable of carrying West
§ 266-4.3 CHARTER § 266-4.3
C:427
Nile Virus and other diseases. The Allegheny County Health
Department, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the
Natural Resource Conservation Service, the Pennsylvania
Extension Service, or other qualified professional consultant
shall be consulted during the design of these facilities in order
to ensure the health of aquatic communities and minimize the
risk of creating mosquito breeding areas.
(c) An outlet structure shall be designed to allow complete
drainage of the pond for maintenance.
(d) The design of a retention basin shall include the determination
of the proposed site's ability to support a viable permanent
pool. The design shall take into account such factors as the
available and required rate and quality of dry weather inflow,
the stormwater inflow, seasonal and longer-term variations in
groundwater table, and impacts of potential pollutant loadings.
(e) Sediment storage volume equal to at least 20% of the volume
of the permanent pool shall be provided.
(f) A sediment forebay with a hardened bottom shall be provided
at each inlet into the retention basin. The forebay storage
capacity shall at minimum be 10% of the permanent pool
storage. The forebay shall be designed to allow for access by
maintenance equipment for periodic cleaning. A permanent
concrete cleanout maker shall be installed in the forebay to
indicate the level where 25% for the forebay storage has been
used.
(g) Emergency spillways shall be sized and located to permit the
safe passage of stormwater flows from an unattenuated
100-year post-development storm with one foot of freeboard.
The maximum velocities in vegetated spillways excavated in
otherwise undisturbed soil shall be analyzed based upon the
velocity of peak flow in the emergency spillway during an
assumed clogged primary outlet condition. Where maximum
velocities exceed design standards contained in the
Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices (USDA,
SCS, July 1984), suitable lining shall be provided. All
emergency spillways placed on fill materials shall be lined.
Lining for emergency spillways shall incorporate native colors
and materials where possible including mono slab revetments,
grass pavers, rip rap and native stone.
(h) Basin and pond embankments must be designed by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Pennsylvania.
The design must include an investigation of the subsurface
conditions at the proposed embankment location to evaluate
settlement potential, groundwater impacts, and the need for
seepage controls. The submittal of a geotechnical report from a
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.3
C:428

effective height or posing a significant hazard to downstream
property or life is required. The selection of fill materials must
be subject to approval of the design engineer.
[1] Fill must be free of frozen soil, rocks over six inches, sod,

materials. Embankment fills less than 10 feet in fill height
must be compacted using compaction methods that would
reasonably guarantee that the fill density is at least 90% of
the maximum density as determined by standard proctor
(ASTM-698). All embankment fills more than 10 feet in fill
height must be compacted to at least 90% of the maximum
density as determined by standard proctor (ASTM-698)
and must have their density verified by field density
testing. A PADEP dam permit is required for embankments

surrounding environment; for example, native rock shall be
used in constructing dissipaters where practical.
(s) Discharge points. The minimum distance between a proposed
basin discharge point (including the energy dissipater, etc.)
and a downstream property boundary shall in no case be less
than 20 feet. Where there is discharge onto or through
adjacent properties prior to release to a stream, designers
shall demonstrate how downstream properties are to be
protected. The Engineer may require that the setback distance
be increased based upon factors such as topography, soil
conditions, the size of structures, the location of structures,
and discharge rates. A drainage easement may also be
required.

clear of any structures, sheds, retaining walls, swing sets,
stored debris, etc. The entire twenty-five-foot easement, unless
otherwise approved by the Township, must remain on the
applicant's property.
(v) An access road, with a twenty-foot private, legal easement, to
the basin must be provided from a public road to the berm of
the basin. The access road shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide

provided the designer demonstrates to the Township's
satisfaction that the basin bottom will be landscaped with
appropriate wetland vegetation pursuant to § 266-4.4. In
addition, detention basins of sufficient size and slope may
serve other functions as well, including recreational uses

(d) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path
through the retention basin.
(e) Low-flow channels. Low-flow channels constructed of concrete
or asphalt are not permitted. Where low-flow channels are
necessary, they shall be composed of a natural or
bioengineered material. Low-flow channels shall be designed

60.Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Township offices.
§ 266-4.3 HAMPTON CODE § 266-4.4
C:438
(1) Assisting in the management of stormwater;
(2) Stabilizing the soil within such facilities to minimize and control
erosion;
(3) Enhancing the visual appearance of such facilities; and
(4) Mitigating maintenance problems commonly associated with the
creation of such facilities.
B. A planting plan and planting schedule shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
(1) Wet meadows including floors of stormwater management
facilities.
(a) Wet meadows and floors of stormwater management facilities
shall be planted with noninvasive plants native to western
Pennsylvania such as wildflowers and noninvasive grasses, the
intent being to create a mixed meadow of such plantings,
where appropriate. Selection of plantings shall be based on
whether the area in question is usually well drained or
permanently wet and whether the area will be used for
recreation purposes. No woody plants shall be planted within
the saturated zone (phreatic line) of a stormwater
management facility or on a berm constructed for impounded
water.
(b) Seeding by drills, corrugated rollers, cyclone or drop seeders
or hand seeding of such areas is preferred; however,
hydroseeding followed by hydromulching can be used on wet
ground and steep slopes.
(c) Fertilizers, as a nutrient supplement, shall not be used unless it
is documented that soil conditions warrant such use and
nutrient applied does not exceed plant uptake. Soil for planting
of wildflowers shall contain not less than 3% or more than 10%
organic matter, as determined by an agricultural chemist, with
certification of the test before planting.
(d) Seeding shall take place either between April 1 and May 15 or
between September 1 and October 15. Planting areas shall be
soaked to maintain a consistent level of moisture for at least
four to six weeks after planting. For seeding recommendations,
reference the DEP's E&S Pollution Control Program Manual.
(e) Once established, a single annual mowing when plants are
dormant should be sufficient to maintain a wet meadow and/or
floor of a stormwater management practice.
(2) Wet edges that remain wet all or most of the year shall be planted
with wildflowers, grasses and shrubs. Plants to be located on rims
§ 266-4.4 CHARTER § 266-4.4
C:439
or banks, which remain dry most of the year, shall be planted with
species tolerant of dry soil conditions.
(3) Wooded areas.
(a) Where stormwater management facilities adjoin wooded areas,
trees and shrubs shall be selected and planted outside the
practice so as to blend with existing surroundings.
(b) Plantings in such areas shall be of sufficient density to
eliminate the need for mowing.
(c) It is recommended that clusters of trees and shrubs be planted
around stormwater management facilities but well away from
outfalls and any constructed berms, where applicable, to
provide for wildlife habitat, wind control and buffering and
screening.
(d) Vegetation shall be planted during appropriate times of the
year, predominantly between late March and mid-May or from
early October until evidence of ground freezing, depending
upon the species selected. Most deciduous trees and shrubs
can be planted in either spring or fall. Evergreens are best
planted in late summer or early fall.
(4) Slopes.
(a) Where slopes are gentle, a mixture of meadow grasses and
wildflowers (for wet meadows) shall be planted.
(b) On steep slopes as defined by the Township's Code of
Ordinances, dense spreading shrubs (shrubs tolerant of dry
soils) shall be planted. Heavy mat mulch shall be used during
the period of establishment.
(c) No woody plant materials or trees shall be located on a
constructed or natural berm acting as the impoundment
structure of a stormwater management practice. Trees shall be
located downstream of an impoundment berm a sufficient
distance from the toe of the constructed slope to assure that
the toe of the slope is outside the dripline of the species
planted at maturity but in no case less than 15 feet.
(5) In cases where stormwater management facilities are to be located
in proximity to wetlands or waterways, the applicant's planting
plan and schedule shall consider the sensitive conditions existing
therein and be modified accordingly to reflect existing flora.
(6) Stormwater management facilities shall be screened in a manner
which complements the existing landscape and provides sufficient
access for maintenance.

§ 266-4.5. Riparian (stream) buffer requirements.
Riparian buffers shall be provided for new development sites as per the
following requirements:
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams; keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. A minimum riparian buffer width of 50 feet landward in each direction
from the top of stream banks is required for all waterways having both
a defined bank and a contributing watershed area of greater than 100
acres.
C. A minimum riparian buffer width of 35 feet landward in each direction
from the centerline of the waterway is required for smaller waterways
having a contributing watershed area of less than 100 acres and
greater than 10 acres.
D. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in § 466-4.5A.
(2) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(3) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
E. When wetland(s) extend beyond the edge of the required buffer width,
the buffer shall be adjusted so that the buffer consists of the extent of
the wetland plus a twenty-five-foot zone extending beyond the wetland
edge.
F. Riparian buffer locations and widths should be illustrated on all
subdivision plans with notations requiring that they be maintained in a
natural state.
G. Trails for pedestrians and nonmotorized use only are permitted within a
riparian buffer provided that they are constructed as permeable.
§ 266-4.5 CHARTER § 266-4.5
C:441
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest
practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as
required.
J. Riparian buffers should be illustrated on all grading and erosion and
sedimentation control plans. The defined riparian buffer location should
be properly recorded. The recording should provide a plan illustrating
the riparian buffer location and width and the requirement that it be
maintained in a natural state.
K. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Township and
shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office,
so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property
located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private
ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area required by
zoning, unless otherwise specified in the Township Zoning Ordinance.61

(1) If the storage facilities are to be privately owned and maintained,
the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed
by the Township for a period of 10 years, as estimated by the
Engineer. After that period of time, inspections will be performed at
the expense of the Township.
(2) If the storage facilities are to be owned and maintained by the
Township, the deposit shall cover the estimated annual costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Engineer will
establish the estimated annual maintenance costs utilizing
information submitted by the applicant.
(3) The amount of the deposit to Maintenance Fund, covering annual
inspection and maintenance costs, shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Engineer or Land Use
Administrator shall determine the present worth equivalents,
which shall be subject to the final approval of the governing body.
(4) If a storage facility is proposed, which also serves as a recreation
facility such as a lake or ballfield, the Township may reduce or
waive the amount of the maintenance fund deposit based on the
value of the land for public recreational purposes.
B. If any storage facility (whether publicly or privately owned) is
subsequently eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or
another storage facility (e.g., a distributed storage facility), the unused
portion of Maintenance Fund may be applied to the cost of abandoning
the facility and connecting to the storm sewer system or other facility.
Any amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment
are paid will be returned to the depositor.

minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged
wetting. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the US
Department of Agriculture defines the four groups and provides a list of
most of the soils in the United States and their group classification. The

the right-of-way thereof.
§ 272-12. Street openings and pavement cuts.
A. Permit required.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any tunnel, opening or
excavation of any kind in or under the surface of any street without
first securing a permit from the Manager for each separate
undertaking; provided, however, any person maintaining pipes,
lines or other underground facilities in or under the surface of any
street may proceed with an opening without a permit when
emergency circumstances demand the work to be done
immediately, provided the permit could not reasonably and
practically have been obtained beforehand. In such cases where
65.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 272-11 CHARTER § 272-12
C:473
emergency openings are necessary, however, the Township shall be
notified prior to such openings in one of the following manners:
(a) Fax notification.
(b) Telephone notification.
(c) PA One Call.
(2) The person shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular
business day on which the office of the Manager is open to the
public, and said permit shall be retroactive to the date when the
work was begun.
B. Street openings limited. No person to whom a permit has been granted
shall perform any of the work authorized by such permit in any amount
greater than that specified in the permit. If the permittee desires to
perform additional work not in excess of an amount greater than 10% of
the amount initially specified in the original permit, permittee may
apply to the Manager for an amended permit for the additional work. If
the additional work desired to be performed by the permittee exceeds
10% of the amount specified in the original permit, an application for a

with the original permit shall be deemed to cover any such additional
work as may be added pursuant to the issuance of an amended permit
within the limit specified herein.
C. Commencement of work. Work for which a permit has been issued shall
commence within 30 days after the issuance of the permit therefor. If
not so commenced, the permit shall be terminated automatically unless
the permittee applies for an extension of time within which to
commence work. If such an extension is granted, the original permit
shall remain in force for the period of time specified in the extension.
Permits which terminate by reason of failure to commence work within
30 days after issuance or within any extension of time granted
hereunder may be renewed only upon the payment of an additional
permit fee as originally required.

(permittee) to another, and the work shall not be performed in any place
other than the location specifically designated in the permit.
E. Expiration of permits. Every permit shall expire at the end of the period
of time which shall be set out in the permit. If the permittee is unable to
complete the work within the specified time, he shall, prior to
expiration of the permit, present in writing to the Manager a request for
an extension of time, setting forth therein the reasons for the requested
extension. If the Manager finds that the failure to complete the work
under the permit within the time specified therein was due to
circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the permittee and that
an extension of time to complete the work under the permit is necessary
§ 272-12 HAMPTON CODE § 272-12
C:474
and not contrary to the public interest, the permittee may be granted
additional time for the completion of the work.
F. Municipal utility cuts. All street openings required by the Township
shall be made and restored under the direction and supervision of the
Manager. The permit, fee, deposit, insurance and bond requirements of
this article shall not be applicable to any openings made by or on behalf
of the Township itself.
G. State and county highways. The provisions of this article shall not be
applicable in those instances where the street or highway is maintained
by the commonwealth or by the County of Allegheny; provided,
however, that any person applying for a permit to do work within the
right-of-way of a street or highway maintained by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or by the County of Allegheny which would otherwise
require a permit under the terms of this article shall notify the Manager
at the time that said application is made and at the time that the work
under any permit issued pursuant to said application is begun, so that
proper, safety precautions may be taken by the Township during the
continuation of said work.

the Township or of any other person entitled thereto to use the street
for any purpose for which such street may lawfully be used not
inconsistent with the permit.

article.
(2) Violation of any other applicable provision of the municipal Code or
any law relating to the work.
(3) Existence of any condition or the doing of any act constituting or
creating a nuisance or endangering the life or property of others.
(a) A permittee shall be granted a period of three days from the
date of the notice to correct the violation and to proceed with
the diligent prosecution of the work authorized by the permit
before said permit is revoked.
(b) Written notice of any such violation or condition shall be
served upon the permittee or his agent engaged in the work.

C:475
§ 272-13. Applications and permits.
(c) When any permit has been revoked and the work authorized by
the permit has not been completed, the Manager shall do or
cause to be done such work as may be necessary to restore the
street or part thereof to as good a condition as before the
opening was made. All expenses thereby incurred by the

A. Duties and responsibilities of applicants. It shall be the duty and
responsibility of any applicant to:

not.
B. Duties and responsibilities of permittees. It shall be the duty and
responsibility of any person receiving a permit to:
(1) Pay a minimum permit fee, plus a fee amount per foot for each

(b) The cost of restoring the street surface removed or damaged
by the work done under such permit. The amount of such
deposit shall be computed by the Manager as provided in
§ 272-15 of this article. In the case of public utility companies,
the Township may waive this requirement of a deposit if said
utility companies file with the Township their corporate bond in
66.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

(8) Provide advance notification to operators of underground facilities
about excavation, auguring, blasting or other activities which may
endanger underground facilities, using a one-call system if one is in
operation.
A. Opening and excavation restrictions.

concerned shall be notified by the Township in sufficient time to
determine the validity of the damage or relocation claims. The cost
of such repair work or relocation work may be withheld by the
Manager from the deposit, pending determination of liability for
the damage.
(6) Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the
purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property
subdivision or a precise survey reference point or a permanent
survey bench mark within the Township shall not be removed or
disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission

(7) When work performed by the permittee interferes with the
established drainage system of any street, provision shall be made

be paid by the permittee or deducted from his deposit. No person
shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or extinguish any
barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed or posted in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(10) Access to private driveways shall be provided, except during
working hours when construction operations prohibit provision of
such access. Free access must be provided at all times to fire
hydrants.
(11) Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience
as possible to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic
or to abate dirt or dust nuisance, the Manager may require the
permittee to provide toe boards or bins; and if the excavated area is
muddy and causes inconvenience to pedestrians, temporary
wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee as directed
by the Manager. If the street is not wide enough to hold the
excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk or
walkway, the permittee shall maintain an open minimum two-foot
walkway for safe pedestrian passage.
(12)Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours
of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the
permittee obtains written consent from the Manager to do the work
at an earlier or later hour. Such permission shall be granted only in
the case of an emergency or in the event the work authorized by
the permit is to be performed in traffic-congested areas.
(13) In granting any permit, the Manager may attach such other
conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent
damage to public or private property or to prevent the operation
from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or
in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions may
include, but shall not be limited to:
(a) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed.
(b) Restrictions as to the size, weight and type of equipment.
(c) Designation of routes and/or bonding of roadways upon which
materials may be transported.

C:479
(14) Hydra-hammer, headache ball. The use of a mechanical device for
the breaking of pavement, such as a hydra-hammer, headache ball,
etc., will be permitted only under special written permission of the
Manager.
B. Backfilling and restoring opening.
(1) All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be made in a
workmanlike manner utilizing a jackhammer or road saw and
backfilled properly by the permittee utilizing only stone material as
prescribed by Township specifications. Unless the permittee has
been granted permission to restore the street surface as provided
in Subsection B(4), the permittee also shall place a temporary
surface on the pavement cut, opening or excavation in accordance
with Township specifications. If the permittee has been granted
permission to restore the street surface but weather conditions are
such as to prevent the completion of permanent restoration of the
street surface at the time backfilling is completed, the permittee
shall install a temporary surface in accordance with Township
specifications until such time as weather conditions will permit
permanent restoration of the street surface.
(2) The Manager shall be notified by the permittee during the fortyeight-
hour periods preceding the beginning of backfilling and of
restoration and the approximate time each will be begun.
(3) No backfilling or restoration shall be accomplished unless or until
the Manager is present or permission has been granted for
backfilling or restoration after inspection by the Manager.
(4) The work of final restoration, including both paving surface and
paving base, shall be performed directly by and at the public utility
company's expense; however, upon a public utility company's
application for permission to perform the work of restoration, the
Township may elect to perform the work of restoration utilizing its
own employees/contractor. In such case, the work of restoration,
including both paving surface and paving base, shall be at the
expense of the permittee; this also includes any applicable
inspection fees.
(5) If the Manager finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street
openings may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the
street, or where a number of cross trenches are laid in proximity to
one another, or where the equipment used may cause such damage,
he may require negotiated contribution from the permittee for the
resurfacing in place of patching of such street if the total area of
the proposed patch or probably damaged area exceeds 25% of the
total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete
gutter edges. Such negotiations shall be carried on and
contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
§ 272-14 HAMPTON CODE § 272-14
C:480
(6) After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling
the same shall be prosecuted with due diligence. Unless the
provisions of Subsection B(1) of this section apply, the permittee is
required to complete permanent restoration of the street surface in
accordance with Township specifications within 10 days after
repairs and/or installation are completed. Furthermore, the
permittee shall be required to install and maintain a temporary
pavement surface in accordance with Township specifications
during:
(a) The period between the completion of repairs and/or
installation and the commencement of final restoration; and
(b) The periods during the actual work when workers do not
require access to the excavation.
(7) Inspections of all work authorized by a permit shall be made by the
Manager at such times and in such manner as required to assure
compliance with provisions of this article. If the nature of the work
to be performed under any permit is such as to require the services
of a full-time inspector, the Manager shall provide for the services
of such an inspector.
(8) All inspection costs shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs
shall be based upon a schedule of charges on file in the office of the
Manager.
(9) Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of
a permit, the permittee shall notify the Manager in writing. A
certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the Manager to
each permittee no sooner than one year and not later than 18
months after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been
made, providing the work authorized by the permit has been
performed according to Township specifications. Prior to the
issuance of a certificate, the Manager shall make a final inspection
of the restoration to determine whether Township specifications
have been adhered to.
(10) If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of two
years from date of completion of the permanent restoration, and
permittee fails to make such correction after notification, any
expense incurred by the Township in correcting such settlement
shall be paid by the permittee or recovered from his bond, unless
the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the Manager that the
settlement was not due to defective backfilling.
(11) In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in
the charge or care of the Township or any of its officers or
employees, and no officer or employee of the Township is
authorized in any way to take or assume any jurisdiction over any
such opening, except in the exercise of the police power when it is
necessary to protect life and property; provided, however, that the

C:481
§ 272-15. Deposits.
Township assumes charge when making final surface restoration
unless permittee has been granted permission to perform the work
of restoration of the street surface as provided in Subsection B(4).
A. Computation of deposit. The Manager, upon receipt of a properly
completed application, shall determine the amount of the deposit to be
made by the permittee in accordance with the schedule of charges
established pursuant to Subsection E of this section; provided, however,
that the minimum deposit required shall not be less than $50. The
deposit shall be paid at the time the permit is issued, and the deposit
shall be used to reimburse the Township for the cost of any work and/or
materials furnished by it in connection with work authorized by the
permit, to cover the cost of all necessary inspections of said work or any
other expenses incurred by the Township in carrying out the provisions
of this article. In the case of a public utility company, the requirement of
such deposit may be waived if such public utility company files with the
Township its corporate bond as provided in § 272-13B(2) of this article.
B. Form of deposit. The deposit may be either in the form of a certified,
treasurer's or cashier's check or in lawful money of the United States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay all costs,
the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the Township an amount equal
to the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to pay such deficiency,
the Township may institute an action to recover the same in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no
additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.
D. Yearly deposit. Whenever any public utility company shall anticipate
applying for permits for more than one street opening or excavation per
calendar year and does not elect to file a corporate bond as
hereinbefore provided, such public utility company may post one
deposit in an amount and form as hereinbefore provided for the
calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of deposits which would
otherwise be required for the anticipated permits.
E. Deposit and cost schedules. The Manager shall establish a schedule of
charges for inspections, labor, materials, and other such expenses as
may be incurred by the Township in carrying out the provisions of this
article. This schedule shall be established by the Manager in
accordance with the reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred by the
Township in making such inspections, including reasonable
administrative and overhead expenses, and in accordance with the
currently prevailing costs in the area for any labor and materials which
may be provided by the Township. The Manager shall revise said
schedule from time to time to reflect any increase or decrease in the
costs used to establish said charges. The schedule shall be open to
public inspection in the office of the Manager upon request.68

§ 272-16. Bond requirements.
F. Decision on costs. The decision of the Manager as to the cost of any
work done or repairs made by him or under his direction, pursuant to
the provisions of this article, shall be final and conclusive as to such
cost.
G. Refund and deposit. Upon notification by the permittee that all work
authorized by the permit has been completed and after restoration of
the opening, the Manager shall refund to the permittee his deposit less
all costs incurred by the Township in connection with said permit. In no
event shall the permit fee be refunded.
A. Performance bond where Township does not restore opening. In those
instances where the applicant has received or intends to apply for
permission to perform the work of restoration of the street surface,
each such applicant or permittee, upon receipt of a permit, shall
provide the Township with an acceptable corporate surety bond to
guarantee faithful performance of the work authorized by a permit
granted pursuant to this article. The amount of the bond shall be 100%
of the estimated cost of restoring the street opening. The term of the
bond shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and shall terminate
upon the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final inspection
from the Manager. If the permittee anticipates requesting more than
one permit per year as required by this article, he may furnish one
continuing corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful performance in
such amount as the Manager deems necessary. The amount of such
bond shall be in relation to the cost of restoring pavement cuts to be
made by the permittee throughout the year. In the case of a public
utility company, its corporate bond in a form satisfactory to the Solicitor
may be accepted in lieu of the corporate surety bond required by this
section.
B. Maintenance bond. Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall
provide the Township with an acceptable corporate surety bond
conditioned for compliance with the street opening specifications of the
Township and the provisions of this article. The Manager shall
determine the amount of the bond, and it shall be in relation to the cost
of restoring the pavement cut to be made by the permittee; provided,
however, the minimum amount of the bond shall not be less than
$2,000. The term of each such bond shall begin from the completion
date of the permanent restoration of the opening by the Township and
shall terminate upon the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final
inspection from the Manager. If the permittee anticipates requesting
more than one permit a year, he may file a continuing corporate surety
bond conditioned for compliance with the specifications of the
Township and the provisions of this article in such amount as the
Manager deems necessary. The amount of such bond shall be in relation

Applicability of Regulations
§ 280-6. Scope.
This chapter shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a subdivision
created and recorded prior to the enactment of this chapter, unless they
are proposed to be consolidated or revised. Nor is it intended by this

existing provisions of other laws or ordinances, or with private restrictions
placed upon property by deed, covenant, or other private agreement, or
with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the Township is a
part; except that, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon land
than are imposed or required by such existing provisions of law, ordinance,
contract or deed, it shall be interpreted that they are in addition to the
restrictions of such other existing regulation or ordinance.
§ 280-7. Approval required.
A. A subdivision plat, consolidation plat or land development plan
approved in accordance with this chapter shall be required for:
(1) Any development consisting of single-family dwellings, two-family
dwellings, townhouse units or other multifamily dwellings. The
subdivision plat for such a development shall show each lot

dwellings or commercial, business or industrial structures and/or
buildings in which one or more units or areas will be under
separate and independent ownership or lease, including, but not
limited to, condominiums and the like. Plats and plans, including
declaration plans, required by any statute of the commonwealth for
condominium developments may qualify as a plat or plan pursuant
to this chapter.

C:503
§ 280-8. Compliance required.
No lot in a subdivision may be sold; no permit may be issued to erect, alter,
repair or occupy any building on land in any subdivision; and no building
may be erected in any subdivision unless and until the provisions of this
chapter have been complied with.
§ 280-9. Relationship to planned residential developments.
The provisions of this chapter may be modified for planned residential
developments as authorized in Chapter 310, Zoning, as amended; however,
the conditions, requirements and standards of this chapter which are not
affected or altered by Chapter 310, Zoning, shall apply to all multifamily
and planned residential developments.76
§ 280-10. Modifications.
B. A stormwater management plan shall be required for any development
which, under the requirements of Article VII of this chapter, requires
compliance with the stormwater management regulations of this
chapter.
A. The Township Council, authorized to approve applications within this
chapter, may grant a modification of the requirements of one or more
provisions if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because
of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that
such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of this chapter is observed.
B. All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany
and be a part of the application for development. The request shall state
in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which
the request is based, the provision or provisions of the ordinance
involved and the minimum modification necessary. The request shall
also address the following criteria for consideration by the Township
Council:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
76.Editor's Note: Original § 205, Conservation subdivisions, which immediately followed this
section, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

C:504
authorization of a modification is therefore necessary to enable
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the modification, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) That the modification, if authorized, will represent the minimum
modification that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
C. Approval power is reserved for the Township Council, the request for
modification may be referred to the Planning Commission and
Environmental Advisory Council for advisory comments. The Township
Council shall keep a written record of all actions on all requests for
modifications.

the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the Township
Council in its discretion. Each phase in any residential subdivision or
land development, except for the last section, shall contain a minimum
of 25% of the total number of dwelling units as depicted in the
preliminary subdivision application, unless a lesser percentage is
approved by the Township Council in its discretion. Provided that the
developer has not defaulted with regard to or violated any of the
conditions of the preliminary subdivision application approval,
including compliance with the developer's aforesaid schedule of
submission of final subdivision applications for the various sections,
then the protections afforded in § 280-15D by substantially completing
the improvements depicted in the final subdivision application within
five years shall apply, and for any sections or sections, beyond the initial
section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within the five-year period, the protections in
§ 280-15D shall apply for an additional term or terms of three years
from the date of final subdivision approval for each section. Failure of

§ 280-33 CHARTER § 280-34
C:531
§ 280-35. Storm drainage facilities.
Storm sewers shall be designed and constructed by the developer as
required for the drainage area in which the proposed subdivision is located
for the proper drainage of surface water from each lot in the subdivision in
accordance with the following requirements:
includes a sewage treatment plant and a house connection for each lot,
provided that such system is designed and the plant so located that it
can be integrated into the future sewer system planned or programmed
for the area and the temporary treatment plant abandoned at such time
when public sewers are installed. All plans for sewage treatment plants
shall be submitted to the Township/Environmental Services Director for
review and written comments.
C. On-lot septic system. If a subdivision cannot reasonably be served by
the extension of existing public sanitary sewers, as determined by the
Planning Commission and Township/Environmental Services Director,
individual septic tanks may be installed, subject to the approval of the
Allegheny County Health Department, on lots of the size required by
Chapter 310, Zoning, if soil percolation tests have indicated a
reasonable useful life of such disposal methods, in accordance with
Allegheny County Health Department requirements. No subdivision
consisting of more than five lots utilizing septic tanks shall be
permitted.
A. Public storm sewers available. Where a public storm sewer is
reasonably accessible, as determined by the Planning Commission, the
developer shall connect to the storm sewer drainage system, if
adequate capacity exists in the system, and shall do such grading and
provide such drainage structures as may be required. Storm sewers and
drainage facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the design
standards of Article VI and the Township Construction Standards. If
required by Article VII of this chapter, stormwater management
facilities shall be constructed by the developer in accordance with this
chapter and the Township Construction Standards.
B. Public storm sewers not accessible. If the subdivision is in an area
where a public stormwater system is not available, the developer shall
do such grading and provide such drainage structures as may be
required by the Township Engineer. All storm drainage shall be carried
to a natural watercourse of sufficient size to accept the drainage from
the development.
C. Easements required. Whenever the construction of streets and
necessary stormwater systems of the subdivision is such that the
direction of stormwater flow is diverted to affect surrounding
properties, the developer shall obtain sufficient drainage easements to
provide adequate disposal of water. The developer may be required to
deed in fee, dedicate or grant an easement to the Township for a
§ 280-34 HAMPTON CODE § 280-35
C:532
§ 280-36. Water supply.
Water supply shall be designed and constructed by the developer to provide
a water supply to each lot. Where public water supplies are within
reasonable distance, as determined by the Planning Commission and
Township Authority, the developer shall construct a system of water mains
that connects with such public water supply and provides connections for
each lot. If the subdivision cannot be reasonably served by the extension of
an existing public water supply, as determined by the Planning Commission
and Township Authority, the Commission and Authority may permit the
installation of a community water supply or on-site wells to serve each lot.
§ 280-37. Underground utilities.
The developer shall be responsible for contracting with private utility
companies and for providing any easements required by those utility
companies to guarantee that each lot shall be served by telephone, gas and/
or electricity and cable television. All such utilities in any subdivision which
consists of three or more lots shall be installed underground in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and as shown on the
street detail in the Township Construction Standards.
§ 280-38. Streets.
Each lot shall have frontage on a public street, as defined by this chapter. If
a lot does not have frontage on an existing public street, a public street shall
be provided by the developer which is constructed in accordance with the
design standards of Article VI and the Township Construction Standards,
unless an exception or modification to this requirement is granted in
accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of this chapter.
§ 280-39. Grading.
The developer shall grade each subdivision in order to establish street
grades, floor elevations of buildings and lot grades in proper relation to
each other and existing topography and natural features such as existing
trees. Streets shall be graded in accordance with the plans, profiles and
specifications approved with the final plat, as filed with the Inspector, and
the design standards of Article VI.
§ 280-40. Extra-size and off-site improvements.
The developer shall be required to extend improvements to serve adjoining
unsubdivided land. If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary
of the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission shall require the
developer to construct off-site extensions of the improvements. Procedures
for providing extra-size and off-site improvements on the necessary public
lands and general standards for prorating costs are set forth below.
drainage channel not less in width than required by existing topography
along the watercourse.
§ 280-35 CHARTER § 280-40
C:533
A. Extra-size improvements. Where improvements in excess of the size
needed to serve only the proposed subdivision are required, the
developer shall pay the total cost of the improvements he is required to
install to service the subdivision, plus the portion of additional cost
which the government body having jurisdiction may assess against the
benefitted property owners of the entire service or drainage area. For
example, if a storm sewer of 24 inches or sanitary sewer of 18 inches or
water main of 12 inches is required to serve the proposed subdivision,
and each is less in size than the sewer trunk line or water mains which
would be required to properly serve the area, the Township may
construct the extra-size utility and require a deposited advance from
the developer for the cost of the utility he is required to install and his
portion of other costs which the governmental body having jurisdiction
may assess against the benefitted owners of the service or drainage
area.
B. Off-site extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission may
require, as a precedent to the approval of the preliminary plan and final
plan, assurances that the improvement extensions shall be provided as
follows:
(1) If the Commission finds the extension across undeveloped areas
would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening
properties or as a governmental expense until some future time,
the developer may be required, if he wishes to proceed with the
development, to obtain necessary easements or rights-of-ways to
construct and pay for the extensions.
(2) The governmental body having jurisdiction may construct and pay
for the extensions and assess the cost to the owner's benefit and
require a deposit from the developer as described in Subsection A
above. The governmental body having jurisdiction may establish a
revolving fund to pay for the development costs and not collect the
assessments on the intervening land until it is developed.
C. Prorating costs. In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the
Planning Commission shall consider, in addition to the standards set
forth in this section and other regulations of the state, county and
Township, the following conditions:
(1) The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision.
(2) Traffic estimate to be generated by the development in relation to
the present streets.
(3) Natural drainage area for sewers and service areas for water.
(4) Development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision.
(5) The sequence of land and utility development in the vicinity.

streetlights of a type approved by the Township and on poles prescribed
by the Township on all public and private streets. Installation shall be in
accordance with the Township Construction Standards. The cost of the
lights, poles and installation shall be assumed by the developer. At a
minimum, streetlights shall be installed at all intersections of local streets
with arterial or collector streets. The location of streetlights in plans
containing more than 100 dwelling units shall be shown on the plan, and the
spacing and location of the streetlights shall be approved by the Township.
§ 280-42. Street signs.
The developer shall install street name signs, approved by the Township,
at all street intersections. The cost of the street signs and posts shall be
assumed by the developer. Street signs shall be installed in accordance with
the Township Construction Standards. Street signs shall be installed as soon
as paving of the streets is completed by the developer.
§ 280-43. Shade trees.
(6) Any other condition they may find pertinent.
A. The developer shall be required to plant street trees along all public
streets in the subdivision. The trees shall be placed between 10 and 15
feet of the street right-of-way and shall be spaced at intervals of a
maximum of 50 feet. At street corners, the trees shall be located a
minimum of 25 feet from the intersection of the street right-of-way line.
The type of tree provided shall be appropriate for local soil and climate
conditions and shall be approved by the Environmental Advisory
Council in accordance with a recommended list of trees maintained by
the Township. These shade trees shall be a minimum of 1 1/2 inches in
diameter at breast height (DBH) and at least six feet in height.
B. In addition to the required shade trees, the developer shall preserve, to
the maximum extent practical, species of existing trees on the site of
the proposed subdivision and which have a diameter at breast height
exceeding four inches, except for those trees which are located within
the right-of-way of proposed streets in the plan

where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and erosion, as
approved by the Township Engineer, based on information submitted by
the developer's geotechnical engineer in accordance with Chapter 161,
Grading and Excavation. All lot areas which slope towards streets or
adjacent lots shall be required to provide adequate and varied cover
vegetation so as to prevent washing and erosion and to be aesthetically
pleasing.
D. Removal of debris during construction. During construction, the
developer shall remove and dispose of all uprooted trees, stumps,
brush, rubbish, unused building materials and debris promptly in the
interest of public safety.
E. Flood-prone areas. Land which is naturally poorly drained or subject to
periodic flooding shall not be used for residential development or for
any uses which may involve danger to health, safety and general

A. Layout. Streets shall be planned to conform with the layout of existing
and planned streets and so located as to allow proper development of
surrounding properties. Local streets shall be laid out so as to
discourage through traffic. Collector streets should be designed to
provide adequate flow of traffic from local streets to major community
facilities and to arterial streets. If the subdivision abuts an existing or
proposed arterial street, either marginal interceptor streets running
parallel to the arterial street or reverse frontage lots shall be utilized.
B. Continuation of existing streets. The continuation of streets into and
from adjoining areas shall be required. All existing or proposed streets
shall be continued at not less than their existing or planned width.
Suitable access and street openings shall be provided for adjacent
undeveloped property.
C. Topography. Proposed streets shall be planned to conform to the
contour of the land, to provide buildable lots, to have a suitable
alignment and grade, and to allow proper drainage.
D. Grading. The shoulders shall be graded to the full width of the right-ofway,
and provisions shall be made for protection of slopes beyond the
right-of-way.
E. Street grades. Minimum grades on all streets shall be at least 1%.
Center-line grades shall not exceed the following:
(1) Local street: 12% for a distance of no more than 1,200 feet.
(2) Collector street: 8%.
(3) Arterial street: 5%.
(4) Vertical curves shall be installed on all street grade changes
exceeding 1%.
F. Right-of-way and cartway widths. Minimum street rights-of-way and

Berms shall be graded to a slope of one on 10 and seeded on each
side of the cartways on all types of streets.
G. Additional right-of-way widths. When a proposed subdivision or land
development abuts an existing public street which has less than the
required right-of-way width, the Township shall require the dedication
§ 280-50 CHARTER § 280-50
C:539
of the additional right-of-way necessary to bring the existing street
right-of-way width into compliance with the requirement of this chapter.
H. Street specifications. All streets shall be constructed in accordance
with the requirements of the Township Construction Standards.
I. Intersections. Intersections involving the crossing of more than two
streets or the junction of more than four streets shall be prohibited.
Right-angle intersections shall be used whenever practical, particularly
where local streets intersect collector or arterial streets; however, in no
case, shall the angle of intersection be less than 75 1/2°. Intersections
of local streets with major streets shall be kept to a minimum, and no
such intersection shall be closer than 150 feet to another such
intersection. Local streets shall not intersect the same side of a
collector street at intervals of less than 600 feet. Where the grade of
any street at the approach to an intersection exceeds 5%, a leveling
area shall be provided with a transitional grade not to exceed 3% for a
distance of 50 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersection.
Where two collector streets or a local and collector street cross at
grades in excess of 10%, the profiles of the more traveled road shall be
reduced across the intersection with two vertical curves to achieve a
grade of 8% or less for the width of the paving of the intersecting less
traveled road. This requirement may be modified, upon approval by the
Township Engineer, depending on the design speed of the involved
roads. The street pavement edge shall be rounded at the intersections
by an arc with a minimum radius of 25 feet on local streets intersecting
with local or collector streets and 30 feet for local streets intersecting
with arterial streets. Right-of-way lines shall be rounded by an arc
which is concentric with the curbline.
J. Street alignment.
(1) The minimum center-line radius for horizontal curves on arterial
streets shall be 700 feet; for collector streets, 250 feet; and for
local streets, 125 feet. On culs-de-sac proposed for dedication, the
minimum horizontal curves may be reduced, on review of the site

(b) The transition to sharp curves may be attained through a
several-step compound curve, such as a three-centered
compound curve.
K. Vertical curves. Vertical curves for collector and local streets shall be as
follows:
(1) Vertical curves shall be used in all changes of grades. The minimum
vertical curve shall be 150 feet in length for arterial streets, 100
feet in length for collector streets, and 50 feet in length for local or
marginal access streets. Vertical curves shall be increased 20 feet
for each 1% of grade change exceeding 3%.
(2) Vertical sag or crest curves at intersections of local streets may be
as short as 100 feet in length, provided that the construction plans
show grading that provides minimum unobstructed distance in all
streets as viewed from the intersection.
L. Culs-de-sac. A cul-de-sac will not be approved when a through street is
practical and shall not be more than 800 feet in length, unless a
modification or exception to this requirement is granted under Article
VIII of this chapter. A cul-de-sac shall be provided at the closed end with
a turnaround which has a paved inside curved diameter of 80 feet and a
right-of-way diameter of 100 feet.
M. Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as
streets to permit future extensions into adjoining tracts or when
designed as culs-de-sac. Any road temporarily dead-ended because of
approved staged development or other reasons shall provide a suitable
all-weather temporary turnaround in accordance with Subsection N
below.
N. Temporary turnarounds. An all-weather temporary turnaround shall be
required where a road is constructed to an adjoining property line. The
right-of-way width required for a temporary turnaround shall be a
minimum of 50 feet, and the outer paving radius of the temporary
turnaround shall be 20 feet. The use and maintenance of the temporary
turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public by the developer until
such time as the road is accepted by the Township.
O. Half streets. Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing
half or partial street, the other part of the street shall be provided
within the proposed subdivision.
P. Visibility. No fence, hedges, shrubbery, walls, planting (other than trees

none of which presently connect with or to an existing private
street, and provided the conditions set out in § 280-65B(1) through
(9), inclusive, are observed.
(2) In the case of submissions of simple subdivisions of no more than
two lots along a private street, the following conditions must be
met by the applicant to justify the granting of an exception to the
requirement of this chapter to dedicate and construct a public
street:
(a) The approval of a private street shall be subject to the

permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
B. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for

Pennsylvania Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, for and in
respect to the transaction or any part thereof, an additional tax at

is in addition to the tax set forth in Subsection A of this section and is
not subject to any of the limitations set forth either in Subsection A of
this section or in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, as amended, 53 P.S. § 6924.101 et seq.

an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds, wherein the date
of the payment of the taxes, the amount thereof, and the signature of
the collecting agent shall be set forth.

not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 290-6. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by this article shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property line
adjustments, provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the commonwealth is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to the Township of Hampton, the Hampton School
District or Allegheny County, pursuant to acquisition by either or all
of the aforesaid entities of a tax delinquent property at sheriff's sale
or at a tax claim bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
covenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent and
child or the spouse of such child; between brother or sister or the
spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and
grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except that a
subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject
to tax as if the grantor were making such transfer.

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisees or heirs.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee or an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
§ 290-5 CHARTER § 290-6
C:569
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy
of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue reasonably
determines that the primary intent for such merger, consolidation
or division is avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.

record in the name of the corporation or association, where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(14) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt of the grantee or a

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.

C:570
§ 290-7. Documents relating to associations or corporations and
members, partners, stockholders or shareholders thereof.
Except as otherwise provided in this article, documents which make,
confirm or evidence any transfer or demise of title to real estate between
associations or corporations and the members, partners, shareholders or
stockholders thereof are fully taxable. For the purpose of this article,
corporations and associations are entities separate from their members,
partners, stockholders or shareholders.
§ 290-8. Acquired company.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.
(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization, if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax-exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954

interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation.
(21) A transaction wherein the tax due is $1 or less.
(22) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this article, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or minerals, the statement of
value may be limited to an explanation of the reason such document is
not subject to tax under this article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change:
(1) Does not affect the continuity of the company; and
§ 290-6 CHARTER § 290-8
C:571
§ 290-9. Credits against tax.
§ 290-10. Leases.
In determining the term of a lease, it shall be presumed that a right or
option to renew or extend a lease will be exercised if the rental charge
(2) Of itself or together with the prior changes has the effect of
transferring, directly or indirectly, 90% or more of the total
ownership interest in the company within a period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation

§ 290-23. Levy of tax.
For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Township of
Hampton during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such
privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for
that year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance
with the provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the
following purposes as the same may be allocated by the Township from
time to time: 1) emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services; 2) road construction and/
or maintenance; 3) reduction of property taxes; or 4) property tax relief
through implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in
accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead
property exclusion). The Township shall use no less than 25% of the funds
derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to
all other taxes of any kinds or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
§ 290-24. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subparagraph, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) Any person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services
tax may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
§ 290-23 HAMPTON CODE § 290-24
C:582
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of the calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

§ 290-25. Duty of employers to collect.
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility, or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township of Hampton, in consultation with the Collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Township of Hampton or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
section, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the
tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
§ 290-24 HAMPTON CODE § 290-25
C:584
§ 290-26. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 290-27. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 290-28. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession with a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 290-29. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 290-24B(1),
(2) and (3) of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 290-25 CHARTER § 290-29
C:585
§ 290-30. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 290-31. Administration of tax.
A. The situ of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation that requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employee or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,

economic base of the community;
(3) Provide for safe, adequate and attractive housing;
(4) Minimize losses from flooding;
(5) Provide the necessary infrastructure of utilities and vehicular
transportation arteries;
(6) Provide for recreational and community facilities;
(7) Provide for ongoing community planning and growth management;
and
(8) Provide for safe, adequate and attractive commercial, institutional
and technical uses.
B. The preservation and improvement of the environment shall be pursued
by:
(1) The preservation of natural topography, environmentally critical
areas, wetlands, and wooded areas, including the limiting of
hillside development beyond a reasonable gradient, and the control
of floodplains and watersheds;
(2) The limitation of excess erosion, hazardous rock and soil slippage,
sedimentation and other soil and water management problems;
(3) The regulation and control of the design, construction, quality of
materials, use, location and maintenance of grading, excavation
and fill; and
(4) The promotion and dedication of natural open space and wooded
slopeland in order to link the existing and proposed open spaces
and to prevent ecological problems resulting from extensive cut
and fill necessary to develop wooded slopelands.
C. Recognizing that the Township of Hampton is basically a residential
community with limited opportunities for commercial and industrial
growth, the increase of property values, employment opportunities and
the economic base of the community shall be pursued by:
§ 310-3 HAMPTON CODE § 310-3
C:620
(1) The promotion of balanced economic growth and employment

properties, which include properties that are contaminated or
perceived to be contaminated, as well as properties that are
underutilized for various socioeconomic reasons, obsolescence, tax
delinquency and/or blight.
D. The provision of safe, adequate and attractive housing for the entire
population of the community shall be preserved by:
(1) The provision of a wide range of housing densities, alternatives and
a mix of housing types, correlating residential density and housing
types with topography, environmental conditions, and the capacity
and distance from existing and proposed utilities, streets and
community facilities; and
(2) The promotion of an attractive residential environment through the
implementation of the other objectives set forth herein.
E. The creation and implementation of land use plans shall seek to achieve
the foregoing objectives and:
(1) Avoid incompatible land uses, and protect against the detrimental
effect of incompatible land uses through planting, open space and
natural break in topography; and
(2) Provide site plan control.
F. The provision of recreation and community facilities may be pursued
by:
(1) Using the recreational goals and objectives set forth in the
Township of Hampton Community Leisure Survey and Community
Park Master Plan; and
(2) Providing residential areas with adequate commercial,
governmental, recreational and educational facilities.

ARTICLE VII
Establishment of Zoning Districts
§ 310-28. Division of Township into districts.
The Township of Hampton is hereby divided into 12 classes of zoning
districts as shown graphically on the Official Zoning Map. These classes of
districts, together with the general objectives for establishing each, are as
follows:
A. Conservation A District. This district includes land that is used for
recreation, municipal or educational purposes which, if used
intensively, would unduly harm the public health, safety and/or welfare.
Much of this land is on steep slopes subject to landslides and excessive
siltation of streams, and in floodplains. Development of these areas
would alter drainage patterns, create severe erosion problems and
damage to downstream areas, as well as endangering human lives and
property affected by such development. The publicly owned areas, in
particular, help to establish an open space network, relieving the
patterns of more intense development surrounding them. All the areas
are significant in enabling the Township Council to fulfill its
responsibilities under Article 1, S. 27 of the Constitution of
Pennsylvania. Recognizing that in a few instances the primary uses for
this district may not provide a reasonable economic use of particular
property, some conditional uses are provided for. It is the intent that
within this Conservation District, such conditional uses be limited
strictly to prevent building on steep slopes where landslides or
excessive erosion and sedimentation of streams are likely to result, or
in floodplains (subject to one-hundred-year base flood), or where the
values protected by Article 1, S. 27, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania
will be harmed. (See § 310-32.)
B. Conservation B District. This district includes land that is held in large
tracts as estates, as farms, or as privately owned outdoor recreation
areas. (See § 310-33.)
C. Residential A District. This district includes land that has already been,
or may be, developed into residential lots of one acre or greater in area,
and adjacent or nearby land whose location and character suggest
large lot development as the highest and best use. (See § 310-34.)
D. Residential B District. This district includes land that has already been,
or may be, developed into residential lots of 1/2 acre or greater in area,
and adjacent or nearby land of similar character, with reasonably good
access to public utilities, major roads and community facilities. These
areas suggest development for lots of medium size, and compatible
residential development or supporting facilities, such as schools,
playgrounds and churches. (See § 310-35.)
E. Residential C District. This district includes land of exceptional
opportunity for residential development because of unusual proximity
§ 310-28 CHARTER § 310-28
C:663
§ 310-29. Overlay districts.
to major highways, public utilities and community facilities and
therefore offers the best location for a relatively denser pattern of
single-family lots and multifamily development. (See § 310-36.)
F. Residential D District. This district includes land where multifamily
residential dwelling units in conjunction with certain limited
commercial uses are likely to occur. This district is developed to provide
a variety of dwelling types within the Township. This district offers the
best locations for higher-density development, with access to arterial
roads, including structures which combine certain commercial uses
with apartments, as well as providing for a buffer area between heavier
developed commercial zones and residential districts. As such,
development is limited to those uses expressly permitted. (See
§ 310-37.)
G. Highway Commercial District. This district includes land abutting
major traffic arteries that has developed or is well suited for sales and
service activities that normally require a market greater than the
Township to succeed. (See § 310-38.)
H. Highway Commercial PNRD Overlay District: This district encompasses
the Highway Commercial Zoning District from Wildwood Road to the
Township's northern border. (See Article IX.B)
I. Neighborhood Commercial District. This district includes strategically
located land at crossroads of important local streets. These areas have
developed or may be developed for commercial activities that support
the daily needs of residential neighborhoods in the vicinity. (See
§ 310-39.)
J. Light Industrial District. This district includes land in large, relatively
flat parcels with good highway access and available utilities that have
been developed, or may be developed by light manufacturing or similar
industry-oriented uses that are compatible neighbors in a basically
residential community. (See § 310-40.)
K. Heavy Industrial District. This district includes land that is insulated
from residential development, has access to railroad transportation
and/or arterial roads, and that have been developed or may be
developed for heavy manufacturing uses. (See § 310-41.)
L. Office, Research and Development District. This district includes land
still in large parcels that has access to arterial roads, is fairly level and
acts as a buffer between adjacent residential areas and nearby
downgrading influences, such as heavily traveled highways or
industrial operations. Uses that will be least disruptive to residential
areas are permitted in this district.
A. Stormwater Management Overlay Districts.
§ 310-28 HAMPTON CODE § 310-29
C:664
§ 310-30. Environmentally Critical Areas Overlay Map.
The Environmentally Critical Areas Overlay Map identifies those areas of
the Township which indicate severe development constraints, i.e., steep
slopes (greater than 15%), floodplains, etc., in which all development shall
be limited through this and other applicable ordinances.
(1) In addition to the zoning districts as delineated on the Official
Zoning Map, the Township of Hampton is hereby divided into a
series of overlay districts, the boundaries of which conform to the
edges of watersheds and watershed sub-basins within the
Township. The boundaries of the districts are graphically shown on
the map titled "Plate 1, Allegheny County Stormwater Management
Plan, Girty's Run, Pine Creek, Deer Creek, Squaw Run," a part of
the Allegheny County Stormwater Management Plan for the Pine
Creek and Deer Creek watersheds, which map is adopted by
reference as part of this chapter.
(2) These districts are established according to the boundaries of the
watersheds designated by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Stormwater Management Act (Act 167 of 1978, as
amended)130 and the watershed stormwater management plans
prepared pursuant thereto for the Pine Creek and Deer Creek
watersheds.
(3) The stormwater management overlay districts are established
separately from the floodplain management districts, which include
those areas of the Township of Hampton subject to inundation
during the one-hundred-year flood, as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map and Flood Insurance Study, copies of which
are available in the Township office.
(4) All uses or lots, in all districts, shall comply with the requirements
and standards for stormwater runoff in the stormwater
management district in which the use or lot is located, as contained
in Chapter 266, Stormwater Management (as amended), and
applicable provisions of the current enacted municipal building
code(s).131

§ 310-43. Purpose and intent.
A. It is the purpose of this article to establish zoning regulations and
controls for the use of land and structures, areas of lots, bulk of
buildings, amount of open space land, the provision of off-street
parking, other similar accessory regulations and to provide a tool for
preserving environmentally critical lands, vegetated riparian buffers,
forests and open space, which have ecological or scenic value, in the
Planned Residential Development Districts in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.144
B. In order that the purpose of this article be furthered in an era of
increasing urbanization and of growing demands for housing of all
types and design, the following principles form the basis for this article:
(1) To provide a means whereby parcels, lands and acreage can be
designed and developed without regard to the normal lot size,
building bulk and setback requirements of the typical zoning
districts. However, in this innovative type of development,
minimum requirements are established to ensure that each living
unit has proper light and air, appropriate access to public ways and
open space and is properly connected to public utilities.
(2) To encourage innovations in residential development which will
provide housing of greater variety in type, design and site planning,
and incorporating conservation of maximum open space as
nonfragmented as possible, nearby to said dwellings.
(3) To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that
economies secured may benefit the homeowner, the developer and
the community.
(4) To provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout
of the residential development to the particular site as well as the
particular demand for housing existing at the time of development.
(5) To ensure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land
development as authorized herein is carried out under such
administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the
disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay,
the following review powers are granted to the Planning
Commission and the Environmental Advisory Council, which act as
the designated planning agencies of the Township of Hampton.
144. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

C:687
§ 310-44. General requirements for planned residential
development.
(a) Review all planned residential development pursuant to the
provisions of this article and shall make recommendations to
the Township Council for approval or disapproval, in writing.
(b) Shall ensure that the applicant conforms to all requirements,
standards, controls and regulations as are set forth in
§§ 310-44 through 310-47 of this chapter.
(c) Ensure that the applicant complies with all the requirements
as set forth in § 310-50 of this article pertaining to application
and hearings on tentative and final approval of a proposed
planned residential development by the Township Council.
C. Establishment of controls. The regulations set by this article are
minimum regulations (unless otherwise stated) within the planned
residential development districts and shall apply uniformly to each
classification or kind of lot and structure within the districts.
D. Other articles of the Zoning Ordinance. The planned residential
districts do not necessarily correspond in minimum lot size, building
area, type of dwelling unit, density, lot coverage or required open space
to any other residential district zoning requirements in the Township.

(2) No application of a planned residential development shall be
considered, or approved, unless the following conditions are met:
(a) The development will be served by public water and sewage
disposal systems, which shall be in place and capable of
functioning prior to the construction of any principal buildings
within the PRD or any stage thereof.
(b) The proposed development is found to be generally consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan of the Township.
(c) The tract of land to be developed shall be in single ownership,
i.e., corporation, venture, partnership, limited partnership, etc.
B. Use regulations. Type of structure(s) permitted within a PRD.
(1) Accessory uses limited to the following (PRD-A, PRD-B, PRD-M and
PRD-I):
§ 310-44 HAMPTON CODE § 310-44
C:690
§ 310-45. Development standards.
(a) Customary residential accessory uses.
(b) Accessory buildings.
(c) Private garages.
(d) Pools (subject to Chapter 285, Swimming Pools).
(e) Municipal parks and playgrounds.
(2) Commercial and institutional uses, to the extent that they are
designed and intended primarily to serve the residents of the PRD
(PRD-A, PRD-B, PRD-M and PRD-I). The standards to be used by
the Planning Commission and Township Council in ascertaining the
granting or withholding of the conditional use should be the same
as those set forth for use in Article XII of this chapter.
(3) Tower-based wireless communications facilities and tower sites
("tower-based WCF"), subject to the standards and criteria set
forth in Article XII, Conditional Uses, specifically § 310-78A(37),
and in Article X, Supplemental Requirements, specifically
§ 310-60C, relating to height exceptions; provided, however, that
same are not located within any required PRD open space.
C. Building size standards.
(1) No structure shall exceed 35 feet in height or contain more than
three stories. See Section 10.300 for additional requirements.
(2) No townhouse shall contain less than three units or more than 10
units.
(3) No garden apartment shall contain less than three units or more
than 24 units.
A. Natural features analysis. A well-designed planned residential
development, integrated with existing social and natural features and
making efficient use of common services, should be an asset to the
community. The site designer and architect, working together, must
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township Planning Commission,
Environmental Advisory Council and Township Council that they have
considered both the opportunities provided and the constraints
imposed by the existing natural and social features, both on and off the
site of the proposed development, in determining site layout and design
of structures. In order to determine which specific areas of the total
planned residential development site are best suited for high-density
development, which areas are best suited for lower-density
development, and which areas should be preserved in their natural
state or utilized as open space areas, a thorough analysis of the natural
features of the site will be required. The following subject categories
must be included in this analysis:
§ 310-44 CHARTER § 310-45
C:691
§ 310-46. PRD density calculation. [Amended 5-24-2017 by Ord. No.
796]
(1) Hydrology. Analysis of natural drainage patterns and water
resources, including an analysis of streams, natural drainage
swales, ponds or lakes, springs, marsh areas, floodplain areas,
permanent high-water-table areas, and seasonal high-water-table
areas throughout the site. All wetland areas must be specifically
identified on the plan.
(2) Geology. Analysis of characteristics of rock formations underlying
the site, including delineation of aquifers (particularly those locally
subject to pollution), shallow bedrock area, and areas in which rock
formations are unstable.
(3) Soils. Analysis of types of soils present in the site area including
delineation of prime agricultural soil areas, aquifer recharge soil
areas, unstable soils, soils most susceptible to erosion, and soils
suitable for urban development. The analysis of soils will be based
on the Allegheny County Soil Survey (USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service).
(4) Topography. Analysis of the site's terrain, including mapping of
elevations and delineation of slope areas greater than 25%,
between 15% and 25%.
(5) Vegetation and wildlife. Analysis of tree and plant cover and
wildlife habitats of the site, emphasizing the location of woodland
and meadowland areas, dominant tree, plant, and animal species
should be identified and the characteristics of each recognized.
Additionally, mapping of all trees over six inches DBH in or near the
area of disturbance shall be shown on the site plans.
B. The Township Council shall require site planning to be in accord with
the results of such analysis, and may require modifications where site
planning has been insufficiently attentive thereto.
A. The density for a PRD shall be calculated by multiplying the number of
units permitted (using the values identified in Table B145) by the
developable acreage of the property. The developable acreage shall be
determined by subtracting the following from the total acreage of the
property:
(1) The acreage used for proposed road rights-of-way, stormwater
detention facilities, floodplains, wetlands, slopes over 25% and
floodways.
(2) The indicated percentages of these environmentally sensitive
areas:

Type of Land Percent
Slopes of 15% to 25% 50%
B. Development tracts with environmentally sensitive areas are subject to
the following limitations:
Type of Land Limitations
Floodway area No units permitted
Floodplain area No units permitted
Wetlands No units permitted
Slopes over 25% No units permitted - disturbance
for utilities, stormwater and
service roads only
Slopes of 15% to 25% Units permitted on only 50% of
this total area
C. Density, area, bulk and setback standards: see Table B.146
D. Conservation of trees and natural features.
(1) The development shall be designed and programmed so as to
minimize earthmoving, erosion, tree clearance, and the destruction
of natural amenities, especially wetlands. All requirements of
§ 310-61 of this chapter shall be met.
(2) No portions of tree masses or trees with six-inch or greater DBH
shall be removed unless clearly necessary for effectuation of the
proposed development. Developers shall make all reasonable
efforts to harmonize their plans with the preservation of existing
trees.
(3) When effectuation of a proposed planned residential development
necessitates the clearing of trees or portions of tree masses, the
developer shall be guided by the following criteria in selecting
trees and ornamentals for retention or clearing:
(a) Aesthetic values (autumn coloration, types of flower and fruit,
bark and crown characteristics, amount of dieback present).
(b) Susceptibility of tree to insect and disease attack and to air
pollution.
(c) Species longevity.
(d) Wind firmness and capability of soil to hold trees.
(e) Wildlife values (e.g., oak, hickory, pine, walnut, and dogwood
have high food value).
146. Editor's Note: Table B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 310-46 CHARTER § 310-46
C:693
(f) Comfort to surroundings (e.g., hardwoods reduce summer
temperatures to surroundings more effectively than pines or
cedars).
(g) Screening for surrounding community (such as year-round
evergreens).
(h) Protection of buildings (e.g., dead and large limbs hanging
over buildings should be removed).
(i) The size of a tree at maturity.
(j) The preservation of areas of unique tree and wildflower stands,
and identified unique trees.
(4) Developers shall exercise care to protect remaining trees from
damage during construction. The following procedures shall be
utilized in order to protect remaining trees: (See also § 310-61F.)
(a) Where existing ground levels are raised, drainage tiles shall be
placed vertically at old soil level and tops brought up to the
surface of the ground and filled with coarse, crushed stone or
gravel. The tiles should be placed to the perimeter of the drip
line of the tree at a maximum of four feet apart.
(b) Trees within 25 feet of a building, or bordering entrances or
exits to building sites, shall be protected by a temporary
barrier during construction.
(c) No boards or other material shall be nailed to trees during
construction.
(d) Heavy equipment operators shall be warned to avoid damaging
existing tree and roots. Roots shall not be cut closer than the
tree's drip line.
(e) Tree trunks and exposed roots damaged during construction
shall be protected from further damage by being treated
immediately with professional procedures.
(f) The operation of heavy equipment over root systems of such
trees shall be minimized in order to prevent soil compaction.
(g) Nondormant trees shall be given a heavy application of
fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible damage caused
by construction operations.
(h) Construction debris shall not be disposed of around or near the
bases of such trees, except for matched vegetative matter used
to prevent soil compaction.
(5) Trees with a minimum caliper of 2 1/2 inches shall be provided by
the developer where deemed necessary by the Township Council to
§ 310-46 HAMPTON CODE § 310-46
C:694
mitigate the loss of existing trees. Unless infeasible, native species
shall be utilized. (See also § 310-61F.)
E. Site design.
(1) Streets.
(a) The design dimensions and construction of all streets shall
comply with the applicable standards found in § 280-50 of
Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development.
(b) The street and walkway systems shall be designed so as to
relate harmoniously with land uses and adjacent streets, and to
minimize through traffic in residential areas. All residential
parking and recreational areas shall be connected by
pedestrian walkways. Walkways that connect residential areas
and parking areas shall be of a durable all-weather surface
satisfactory to Township Council.
(c) A separation of vehicular from pedestrian and bicycle traffic is
encouraged. Where pedestrian walkways are not within a
street right-of-way, a walkway easement of at least 10 feet in
width shall be designated. Where a walkway crosses over open
space land, however, the easement shall not be subtracted
from the open space land for purposes of calculating the area
thereof.
(d) Where dwelling units front on an arterial street, no direct
vehicular access from the lot or tract to the street shall be
permitted.
(2) Stormwater management. All requirements of Chapter 266,
Stormwater Management, as amended, shall be adhered to.
(3) Signs. Signs shall be permitted in accordance with Article XIV of
this chapter.
(4) Off-street parking. All requirements for off-street parking
regulations and standards found in Article XIII of this chapter are
to be followed.
(5) Lighting.
(a) All common parking areas, steps, ramps, walkways of high
pedestrian use, and directional signs shall be adequately
lighted.
(b) The Township Council may require lighting in other areas for
reasons of public safety.
(c) All above required lighting, and all external lighting fixtures
appurtenant to a structure, shall be shielded from all
residential properties and from all rights-of-way so as to
§ 310-46 CHARTER § 310-46
C:695
eliminate light glare beyond an angle of 35° from a vertical
plane. No such lighting shall exceed 20 feet in height.
(6) Landscaping and buffers.
(a) All common parking areas shall be landscaped with trees and
shrubs of varying species which grow well in this area. At least
one shade tree of minimum 1 1/2 inch caliper and measuring
six feet in height shall be provided within the interior of each
parking area for every five parking spaces.
(b) Shade trees of varying species, which grow well in this area,
may be planted along all streets between 10 feet to 15 feet
outside of the street right-of-way, at the developer's option. If
planted, at least one tree of minimum 1 1/2 inch DBH and
measuring six feet in height shall be provided on each side of
the street for each 25 feet of street length or fraction thereof.
(c) All landscaping requirements in § 310-65 of this chapter shall
be met. The street trees as described in Subsection E(6)(b)
above may be counted as part of the requirement in § 310-65D.
(d) The amount, density, and types of plantings shall be based
upon physiographic features, feasibility of using native
species, proximity to adjacent uses, and natural views. If the
PRD consists of multifamily units or single-family detached
dwellings, buffer yards shall be created along the side and rear
property lines as per § 310-59E, even if the PRD adjoins a
residential zoning district. Refer to table in § 310-59E to
determine the required buffer yard. In areas where the
physiographic features and/or existing vegetation provide an
attractive setting, the planting strip may be left in its natural
state or enhanced with additional plant material of lesser
density than a full screen, as long as the end result is screening
at least as dense as that in the required buffer yard.
(e) No planting shall be placed with its center closer than five feet
from a property line of the tract.
(f) All required plantings shall be permanently maintained and, if
necessary to maintain an effective screen, replaced by the
property owner in the event they become diseased or dead.
(g) Planting species shall be mixed; generally, a minimum of 25%
shall be evergreen and 10% flowering material, except in the
case of buffer yards.
(h) All buffer yard requirements identified in § 310-59E of this
chapter shall be met.
(i) Disturbed topsoil shall be stockpiled, protected from erosion,
and replaced after construction.
§ 310-46 HAMPTON CODE § 310-46
C:696
(j) Planting and protection of landscape material shall be in
accordance with a plan and schedule prepared by a registered
landscape architect, and shall be completed within six months
of initial occupancy of each stage of development.
Maintenance specifications for all plant materials shall be
submitted with the final plan.
F. Facilities other than dwellings located in a PRD. Any parcel on which
such facilities are located shall be bounded by a buffer strip on all
property lines abutting, or directly across a street from residential uses.
Such buffer strips shall follow the buffer yard requirements identified in
§ 310-59E, but must also provide an adequate and attractive vegetative
screen on its front street side.
(1) Supplemental facilities for commercial services to serve the
residents of the planned residential development and for
recreational purposes may be provided within a planned residential
development, based upon the following requirements:
(a) Recreational facilities may be located within required open
space areas; provided, however, no buildings shall be
constructed within a floodway, wetlands, or floodplain area or
within an area having a slope greater than 25%. Ownership
and maintenance shall be in accordance with § 310-47B and E
hereof.
(b) No convenience stores may be provided unless a market
analysis has been completed indicating that such facility will
be supported by the planned residential development. A
maximum of 20 square feet of gross leasable floor space may
be provided for each dwelling unit. The total of such floor
space may be increased by an additional 15 square feet for
each dwelling unit in excess of 200 units within the planned
residential development.
(2) All convenience stores shall comply with the following standards:
(a) Locations shall be such as not to interfere with the adjacent
residential uses. Architectural compatibility with residential
structures to be erected within the planned residential
development shall be maximized.
(b) Freestanding signs are prohibited. All permitted signs,
including lighted signs, shall be attached to an exterior wall
(not roof) of the structure, and may be mounted either flush
thereto or at right angles thereto.
(c) Refuse stations must be designed and screened, be in locations
convenient for collection and removal, and not be offensive or
visible to the occupants of adjacent residential uses.
§ 310-46 CHARTER § 310-46
C:697
§ 310-47. Standards for open space and common ground.
(d) Buildings designed or intended to be used, in part or in whole,
for commercial purposes shall not be used or occupied as such
prior to the completion of at least 50% of the dwelling units
proposed in the plan.
A. Amount.
(1) The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as
permanent open space, not to be further subdivided, and protected
through a conservation easement, shall be as specified below:
(a) The minimum percentage of the adjusted developable acreage
shall be as specified in Table B.147
(b) At least 25% of the required open space must be located on
buildable land which is suitable for active recreation, but only
half of this portion may actually be utilized for active
recreation that requires structures and/or permanent facilities.
The rest is to be left natural for passive recreation and wildlife
habitat.
(c) There is no minimum percentage of amount of land required
for common ground. Overflow parking areas, landscaped areas
around buildings or along streets, etc., will depend upon the
developer's site plan as to whether there are any elements
which will need common ownership within the development.
(2) All common ground and/or open space, both natural and active
recreational, and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be
restricted from further subdivision through a permanent
conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the Township and
duly recorded in the County Register of Deeds Office.
(3) All land designated as common ground and/or open space shall
remain in perpetuity and shall be limited to the uses as specified
under the definitions of common ground and of natural area open
space and recreational area open space in this chapter. This
common ground and/or open space shall be designated parcels of
land with this restriction clearly stated on the deeds and in any
homeowner's association agreement or Township or conservation
organization agreements. There shall be no other uses allowed on
common ground and/or open space lands.
B. Ownership. Any of the following methods may be used, either
individually or together, to preserve, own, and maintain open space
and/or common ground: transfer of fee simple title or easements to a
private conservation organization; fee simple dedication; dedication of
easements; and condominium or homeowners' association. The
147. Editor's Note: Table B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 310-46 HAMPTON CODE § 310-47
C:698
Township shall have the right of first refusal of accepting the open
space, but the Township is not obligated to accept the open space.
Such land shall not be eligible for transfer to another party except for
transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this section,
and then only where there is no change in the open space ratio of
the overall development. The following specific requirements are
associated with each various method:
(1) Homeowners' association. The common ground and any developed
active recreational areas which are only for the benefit of the PRD
residents must be held in common ownership by homeowners'
association. Other open space may be held in common in this way,
provided that a legal conservation easement is established with
either the Township or a nonprofit conservation organization, as
defined in Subsection B(4). In addition to this, a public land
dedication, not exceeding 10% of the total parcel size, may be
required by the Township, extending through the open space, to
facilitate trail connections. This method shall be subject to all of the
provisions for homeowners' associations set forth in Subsection C,
below, and the homeowners' association agreement shall be a legal
document, duly signed and recorded. A copy of this signed and
recorded document shall be submitted to the Township to be kept
on record with the PRD plan.
(2) Fee simple dedication. The Township may, but shall not be required
to, accept any portion or portions of the open space, provided: such
land is accessible to the residents of the Township; there is no cost
of acquisition (other than any costs incidental to the transfer of
ownership, such as title insurance); and the Township agrees to
and has access to maintain such lands. Where the Township
accepts dedication of open space that contains improvements, the
Township may require the posting of financial security to ensure
structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning
of said improvements for a term not to exceed 18 months from the
date of acceptance of dedication. The amount of financial security
shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
(3) Transfer to a private conservation organization. With permission of
the Township, an owner may transfer either the fee simple title,
with appropriate deed restrictions running in favor of the
Township, or restrictive easement to a private nonprofit
organization, among whose purposes is to conserve open space
land and/or natural resources, provided: the organization is
acceptable to the Township and is a bona fide conservation
organization with perpetual existence; the conveyance contains
appropriate provision for proper reverter or retransfer in event
that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue
carrying out its functions; and a maintenance agreement
acceptable to the Township is reached.
§ 310-47 CHARTER § 310-47
C:699
(4) Dedication of easements.
(a) Township may, but shall not be required to, accept
conservation easements for public use of any portion or
portions of open space land, title to which is to remain in
ownership by condominium or homeowners' association,
provided: such land is accessible to the residents of the
Township; there is no cost of acquisition (other than any costs
incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title
insurance); and a maintenance agreement acceptable to the
Township is reached.
(b) With the permission of the Township, an owner may transfer
conservation easements to a private, nonprofit, organization,
among whose purposes it is to conserve open space and/or
natural resources, provided that: the organization is
acceptable to the Township and is a bona fide conservation
organization with perpetual existence; the conveyance
contains appropriate provision for proper reverter or
retransfer in event that the organization becomes unwilling or
unable to continue carrying out its functions; and a
maintenance agreement acceptable to the Township is
reached.
(5) Condominium. The common ground and/or open space may be
controlled through the use of condominium agreements approved
by the Township. Such agreement shall be in conformance with the
Uniform Condominium Act. All open space land shall be held as
"common element."
C. Specific requirements for homeowners' associations. If a homeowners'
association is formed, it shall be governed according to the following
regulations:
(1) The developer shall provide to the Township a description of the
organization, including its bylaws and documents governing
common ground and/or open space maintenance and use
restrictions.
(2) The organization shall be established by the developer and shall be
operating (with financial subsidization by the developers, if
necessary) before the sale of any lots within the development.
(3) Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
homes therein and their successors.
(4) The organization shall be responsible for the maintenance,
insurance and real estate taxes on all common ground and/or open
space whose title is held by the homeowners' association.
(5) The members of the organization shall share equally the costs of
maintaining natural area open space, and maintaining and
§ 310-47 HAMPTON CODE § 310-47
C:700
developing common ground and/or active recreation area open
space, in accordance with the procedures established by them.
(6) In the event of any proposed transfer of common ground and/or
open space land by the homeowners' association within the
methods here permitted, or of the assumption of maintenance of
common ground and/or open space land by the Township as
hereinafter provided, notice of such action shall be given to the
Township and all property owners within the planned residential
development by the homeowners' association no less than 30 days
prior to the event.
(7) The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain common ground and/or open space.
(8) Lease of common ground and/or open space.
(a) The homeowners' association shall not sell, but may lease back
common ground and/or open space lands to the developer, his
heirs and assigns, or to any other person or corporation
qualified to manage common ground and/or open space lands
for operation and maintenance of these lands, but such a lease
agreement shall provide:
[1] That the residents of the planned residential development
shall have access to the common ground and/or open
space lands contained therein;
[2] That the common ground and/or open space to be leased
shall be obtained only for the uses and purposes set forth
in this chapter; and
[3] That the operation of common ground and/or open space
facilities may be for the benefit of residents of a planned
residential development only or may be open to the
residents of the Township.
(b) The lease shall be subject to the approval of the Township, as
shall any transfer or assignment of the lease. Lease
agreements so entered into shall be recorded with the
Recorder of Deeds of Allegheny County within 30 days of their
execution and a copy of the recorded lease shall be filed with
the Township.
D. Additional standards for open space location and layout.
(1) The open space shall be laid out to the satisfaction of Township
Council, after review by the EAC, in accordance with the best
principles of site design, and shall be consistent with all Township
land use plans.
(a) Natural area and open space shall be located and designed as a
solid area, or contiguous areas, to preserve the natural
§ 310-47 CHARTER § 310-47
C:701
features and to be easily accessible to residents of the planned
residential development, and to the general public if that open
space is to be held for public use. Whenever possible, it should
be designed to include a variety of wildlife habitats and terrain,
such as wetlands and stream, open meadows and woodlands.
(b) The open space areas must have land which is left in its
predevelopment state as a natural area open space. It may also
have some active recreation area open space land which may
include active recreation areas and/or facilities, provided that
§ 310-61 of this chapter is observed.
(c) Natural area open space may include greenways, or likely
travel corridors, linking areas of open space used as food
sources, homes, and breeding. [Amended 5-24-2017 by Ord.
No. 796]
(2) For purposes of calculation, such areas as parking lots, detention
ponds and streets, and buffer yards, unless they fulfill the
requirements to qualify as a greenway as described in Subsection
D(1)(c), are not considered as open space. In addition, land lying
within 15 feet of any residential unit, and/or any area between the
residential units and their access road, shall not be considered
open space.
(3) The open space shall be free of all structures, except those related
to outdoor recreational use and required visible permanent
monuments at each point of direction change along all borders.
(4) An existing permanent retention pond is permissible as open space.
(5) The existing wooded areas or other natural cover shall be retained
in the open space. If this is not feasible in the area being used for
active recreation, then a suitable landscaping plan which is
consistent with the purposes of this section may be required and
approved by Township Council after review by the EAC.
(6) The development shall include at least two pedestrian rights-ofway,
connecting the open space to the streets, being clearly marked
on both the plan and the site. These rights-of-way should be at least
10 feet in width and be for pedestrians or nonmotorized vehicles
only. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to install
permanent markers on the site which will clearly identify the
pedestrian accesses for these rights-of-way. When the open space is
to be used by the general public, a small parking area for a
minimum of four cars shall be provided in proximity to at least one
of the pedestrian access points.
(7) In the event that a planned residential development plan is given
tentative approval and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the
landowner shall elect to abandon said development plan and shall
so notify the governing body in writing, or in the event the
§ 310-47 HAMPTON CODE § 310-47
C:702
landowner shall fail to file application or applications for final
approval within the required period of time or times, as the case
may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and
all that portion of the area included in the planned residential
development plan for which final approval has not been given shall
be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto
as they may be amended from time to time, and the same shall
be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of the municipal
secretary or clerk of the municipality.
(8) Establishment of ownership of common ground and/or open space.
The applicant must establish and assure the future ownership of
the common ground and/or permanent open space land as well as
indicate the provisions for the burden of maintenance and control
of the common ground and/or open space land. In addition, the
Township, at its discretion, may at any time accept the dedication
of land or any interest therein for public use and maintenance, but
the Township need not acquire it as a condition of the approval of
the planned residential development, nor as a condition of the land
being set aside for common ground and/or open space and
dedicated or made available for public use.
E. Maintenance.
(1) In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
a common ground and/or open space, or any successor
organization, shall at any time after establishment of the planned
residential development fail to maintain the common ground and/or
open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with
the development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the planned
residential development, setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common ground and/or
open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30
days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of this notice. At such
hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within
which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in the
original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be corrected
within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the Township, in order
to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned
residential development and to prevent the common ground and/or
open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said
common ground and/or open space and maintain the same for a
period of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute
a taking of said common ground and/or open space, and shall not
vest in the public any rights to use the common ground and/or open
space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public
§ 310-47 CHARTER § 310-47
C:703
§ 310-48. Institutional PRD developments.
by the residents and owners, and such dedication is acceptable
to the Township. Before the expiration of said year, the Township
shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization
therefor responsible for the maintenance of the common ground
and/or open space, call a public hearing, upon notice to such
organization, or to the residents and owners of the planned
residential development, to be held by the Township, at which
hearing such organization or the residents and owners of the
planned residential development shall show cause why such
maintenance by the Township shall not, at the election of the
Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said
common ground and/or open space in reasonable conditions, the
Township shall cease to maintain said common ground and/or open
space at the end of said year. If the Township shall determine such
organization is not ready and able to maintain said common ground
and/or open space in a reasonable condition, the Township may,
in its discretion, continue to maintain said common ground and/or
open space during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter. The decision
of the Township in any case shall constitute a final administrative
decision subject to judicial review.
(2) The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by the
Township shall be assessed ratably against the properties within
the planned residential development that have a right of enjoyment
of the common ground and/or open space and shall become a lien
on said properties. Said assessments or charges shall be
subordinate in lien to the lien of any prior mortgage or mortgages
on the property which is subject to such assessments or charges.
The Township, at the time of entering upon such said common
ground and/or open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file
a notice of such lien, in the office of the Prothonotary of the County,
upon the properties affected by such lien within the planned
residential development. The payment of the appropriate real
estate taxes on the common ground and/or open space shall be
considered to be a part of maintenance and will be subject to the
same enforcement proceedings as specified in § 310-51.
A. Institutional-type developments may be approved as a planned
residential development in all zoning districts of the Township,
excluding, however, RA, RB, CA, CB, and ORD Zoning Districts.

submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with
conditions which have been accepted by the landowner, shall not be
modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the
Township pending an application or applications for final approval,

the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of
the Township Secretary or Clerk of Council.
I. Application for final approval.
(1) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in
a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative
approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall be filed with
the Township office not later than 12 months following the grant of
tentative approval, unless otherwise specified by the Township
Council. The application shall include one reproducible copy and 20
prints of the development plan, including a land development plan
and supplemental data, and a certificate of completion of
improvements or a guarantee of improvements as required by
Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development, as amended.
(a) The land development plan shall include:
[1] All data required for final plat approval as specified in
§ 280-17 of Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land
Development.
[2] A landscaping plan, which shall include the location of
sidewalks, trails, and screening.
(b) The supplemental data shall include:
[1] Any covenants, grants, or easements or other restrictions
to be imposed on the use of the land and its structures.

Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development.
(c) No development plan shall be finally approved unless all
improvements required by this article have been installed in
strict conformance with this article, or the installation of the
improvements by the developer has been guaranteed in the
form of a bond or financial security which is acceptable to the
Township Council and is in an amount sufficient to cover the
cost of the improvements which may be required in accordance
with Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development, as
amended. Such guarantee shall provide for, and secure to, the
public, completion of all identified improvements for the plan
within a period of two years from the date of the final approval
of the development plan. The identified improvements shall
include buffer yards, street trees (if provided), screening, and
permanent open space access markers.
§ 310-50 CHARTER § 310-50
C:713
(2) Final review. The Township shall forward one copy of the
application for approval to the appropriate Township staff
members, the Township's Planning Commission, the Environmental
Advisory Council, the Township Engineer, and the Allegheny
County Planning Commission.
(3) Final approval.
(a) The Township Council shall issue its decision and communicate
it to the developer no later than 45 days after the application
for final approval was referred by Township Council; provided,
however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than
30 days following the filing of the application, the forty-five-day
period shall be measured from the 30th day following the day
the application has been filed.
[1] When an application for a proposed planned residential
development plan has been granted tentative approval, the
applicant shall be granted final approval should the plan
submitted be in accordance with the terms of the grant of
tentative approval.
[2] The Township Council may deny approval of any planned
residential development plan which varies from the plan
granted tentative approval. The Township Council must
forward the written notice of denial to the developer
within 45 days, identifying the reasons that the variations
are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal,
the landowner may either:
[a] Refile the application for final approval without the
variations objected to; or
[b] File a written request with the Township to hold a
public hearing on the application for final approval.
The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the request
and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with
the procedure for hearings on an application for
tentative approval. Within 30 days of the conclusion of
the hearing, the Township Council shall issue a
written decision either granting or denying final
approval in the form required for tentative approval.
(b) Either of these actions shall be taken at any time during which
the applicant is entitled to apply for final approval or shall be
taken within 30 days of notice of refusal, if the time for filing
the final application is already passed. In the event that the
developer fails to take either of these actions within the time
specified, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the planned
residential development plan.
§ 310-50 HAMPTON CODE § 310-50
C:714
§ 310-51. Enforcement of plan provisions.
In accordance with Section 706 of the Municipalities Planning Code,152
to further the mutual interest of the residents of the planned residential
development and the public in the preservation of the development plan, as
finally approved, and to insure that modification, if any, in the development
plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of said residents upon the
(4) Recording. The developer shall record the approved planned
residential development plan in the office of the Allegheny County
Department of Real Estate within the time required by Section 513
of the Municipalities Planning Code,151 or final approval shall
expire automatically.
(5) Revocation. The approval of the planned residential development
plan shall be revoked if the developer gives notice of his intention
to abandon the plan, or if the developer fails to commence within
one year and complete the required public improvements within
two years of the date of such final approval. Then, no further
development shall take place on the property included in the
development plan unless a new development plan is approved or
such development complies with this chapter and Chapter 280,
Subdivision and Land Development. Failure to complete any or all
of the public improvements shall prevent the developer from
applying for tentative or final approval of any additional phases.
(6) Conversion of existing apartments and multifamily dwellings to
condominium or cooperative concepts.
(a) Any applicant or person, partnership, corporation or
landowner whatsoever, desiring to convert existing structures
which permit multiple-family, garden apartments, townhouses
or any other apartment type of uses into condominium or
cooperative-type concepts shall be required to submit to the
Planning Commission and the Environmental Advisory Council
of the Township of Hampton all plans, declarations, etc., for
review by the Planning Commission and the Environmental
Advisory Council and, then for possible approval by the
Township Council of the Township of Hampton.
(b) All applicants or persons whatsoever shall follow the
procedures set forth herein for the development of planned
residential development and shall comply with all the
requirements of this article and the standards set forth herein,
to the extent feasible. No such conversion shall be permissible
until the same shall have been reviewed by the Environmental
Advisory Council and the Planning Commission and approved
by the Township Council.

provisions of the development plan, nor result in change that would
adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the
provisions of the development plan as finally approved, whether those are
recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the
following provisions:
A. The provisions of the development plan shall relate to:
(1) The use, bulk, and location of building and structures;
(2) The quantity and location of common ground and/or open space,
and protection of specified natural resources, except as otherwise
provided in this article; and
(3) The intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run in
favor of the Township and shall be enforceable in law or in equity
by the Township, without limitation on any powers of regulation
otherwise granted the Township by law.
B. The development plan shall specify those of its provisions which shall
run in favor of, and be enforceable by, residents of the planned
residential development; however, that no provisions of the
development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of residents of the
planned residential development except as to those portions of the
development plan which have been finally approved and have been
recorded.
C. All those provisions of the development plan authorized to be enforced
by the municipality under this section may be modified, removed, or
released by the Township, except grants or easements relating to the
service or equipment of a public utility, subject to the following
conditions:
(1) No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the Township shall affect the rights of the
residents of the planned residential development to maintain and
enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in this
section.
(2) No modification, removal or release of the provision of the
development plan by the municipality shall be permitted except
upon a finding by the governing body or the planning agency,
following a public hearing thereon pursuant to public notice called
and held in accordance with the provisions of this article, that the
same is consistent with the efficient development and preservation
of the entire planned residential development, does not adversely
affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across the
street from the planned residential development of the public
interest, and is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon
any person.

C:716
§ 310-52. Purpose of conservation subdivisions; general provisions.
§ 310-53. Standards for design of conservation subdivisions.
D. Residents of the planned residential development may, to the extent and
in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the
development plan, modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the
provisions of the development plan but no such action shall affect the
right of the Township to enforce the provisions of the development plan
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
A. Conservation subdivisions for single-family detached homes, duplexes
and quadraplexes will be a permitted alternative to the conventional
residential subdivision requiring full half- or one-acre lots. Conservation
subdivisions will allow for greater flexibility in design layout and an
opportunity to preserve environmentally sensitive lands and to create
more usable open space in the Township for recreation purposes.
B. In this type of residential development, the overall site plan and the
quantity and quality of the open space are of prime importance.
Innovative design is the key; therefore, variations in minimum lot sizes,
minimum yard setbacks, or maximum lot coverage requirements may
be submitted to Township Council as a modification request to Table
A153 requirements with the subdivision application. Requirements
include calculating the maximum density and for the preservation and
protection of the open space. Accessory structures/uses shall meet the
requirements set forth in Table A and other specific requirements of
this chapter.
C. A minimum of 10 acres is required for a conservation subdivision and
shall be limited to RA and RB Zoning Districts.
A. Determining density.
(1) Estimating the permitted density shall be based on the
mathematical formula listed below.
(2) All land classified as inherently unbuildable (wetlands, onehundred-
year floodplains, and slopes exceeding 25%) shall be
deducted from the site area. A further 10% shall be deducted from
that net area to allow for land required for new streets, thus
producing a new net acreage area which is rounded up to the next
whole acre number. This number of acres is then divided by the
minimum allowable lot area for the zoning district in which the site
is located, as set forth in Table A of this chapter.154 On sites not
served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage
treatment facility, soil suitability for individual septic systems shall
be demonstrated.

§ 310-51 CHARTER § 310-53
C:717
B. Density bonus to endow open space maintenance fund. The Township
may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the
applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent
fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. Spending from
this fund should be restricted to expenditure of interest, in order that
the principal may be preserved. Assuming an annual average interest
rate of 5%, the amount designated for the endowment fund should be
20 times the amount estimated to be required on a yearly basis to
maintain the open space. On the assumption that additional dwellings,
over and above the maximum that would ordinarily be permitted on the
site, are net of development costs and represent true profit, 75% of the
selling price of the lots shall be donated to the open space endowment
fund for the preserved lands within the subdivision. Such estimates
shall be prepared by an agency or organization with experience in open
space management acceptable to the Planning Commission and the
Environmental Advisory Council. This fund shall be transferred by the
developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance
responsibilities (such as a homeowners' association, a land trust, or the
Township).
C. Density bonus for public access. Dedication of land for public use,
including trails, active recreation, etc., in addition to the 10% public
land dedication required under other provisions of this chapter, may be
encouraged by the Township Council, who are authorized to offer a
density bonus for this express purpose. The density bonus for open
space that would be in addition to the 10% public land dedication that
may also be required shall be computed on the basis of a maximum of
one dwelling unit per five acres of publicly accessible open space. The
decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate open space
for public access shall be at the discretion of the Township Council, who
shall be guided by the Environmental Advisory Council and Planning
Commission recommendations contained in the Township's Open
Space, Recreation, and Environmental Resources Plan, particularly
those sections dealing with trail networks and/or recreational facilities.
D. Minimum percentage of open space.
(1) In conservation subdivisions, the following restrictions apply to the
environmentally sensitive lands of the site:
(a) Floodway and flood fringe areas within the one-hundred-year
floodplain. No units permitted.
(b) Wetlands: no units permitted on wetlands of one acre or more
with a buffer of 50 feet and that such wetlands and buffers be
deducted as unbuildable land.
(c) Slopes exceeding 25%: no units permitted.
(d) Land under permanent easement prohibiting future
development, including easements for drainage, access, and
utilities: no units permitted.
§ 310-53 HAMPTON CODE § 310-53
C:718
(e) Slopes of 15% to 25%: units permitted on only 50% of the area.
(f) Riparian buffers, 50 feet per bank: no units permitted.
(2) The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as
permanent open space, not to be further subdivided, and protected
through a conservation easement held by the Township or by a
recognized land trust or conservancy, shall be as specified below:
(a) A minimum of 40% of the total tract area, after deducting the
following kinds of unbuildable land:
[1] Wetlands.
[2] All of the floodway and floodway fringe within the onehundred-
year floodplain.
[3] Land with slopes exceeding 25%, or soils subject to
slumping.
[4] Land required for street rights-of-way (10% of the net tract
area).
[5] Land under permanent easement prohibiting future
development (including easements for drainage, access,
and utilities).
(b) The above areas shall generally be designated as "undivided
open space."
[1] All undivided open space and any lot capable of further
subdivision shall be restricted from further subdivision
through a permanent conservation easement, in a form
acceptable to the Township and duly recorded in the
County Register of Deeds Office.
[2] At least 25% of the minimum required 40% open space
shall be suitable for active recreation purposes, and no
more than 50% shall be utilized for that purpose, in order
to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural areas on the
site. The purposes for which open space areas are
proposed shall be documented by the applicant.
E. Location of open space.
(1) The location of open space conserved through compact residential
development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the
open space and recreation element of the Township's
Comprehensive and Recreation/Open Space Plan and with
recommendations contained in "Designing Open Space
Subdivisions: A Practical Step-by-Step Approach," by Randall
Arendt, MRTPI, published by Natural Lands Trust, September,
1994.
§ 310-53 CHARTER § 310-53
C:719
(2) Open space shall be comprised of two types of land: primary
conservation areas and secondary conservation areas. All lands
within both primary and secondary conservation areas are required
to be protected by a permanent conservation easement, prohibiting
further development, and setting other standards safeguarding the
site's special resources from negative changes. Primary and
secondary conservation areas shall also be considered as
"environmentally critical lands."
(a) Primary conservation areas. The first category consists of
wetlands, land within the one-hundred-year floodplain, slopes
exceeding 25%, and soils subject to slumping. These
environmentally sensitive resources form the core of the open
space that is required to be protected.
(b) Secondary conservation area:
[1] In addition to the primary conservation areas, at least 40%
of the remaining land shall be designated and permanently
protected. Full-density credit shall be allowed for land in
this category that would otherwise be buildable under
local, state and federal regulations, so that their
development potential is not reduced by this designation.
Such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained
parts of the site.
[2] Although the location of primary conservation areas are
predetermined by the locations of floodplains, wetlands,
steep slopes, and soils subject to slumping, greater
latitude exists in the designation of secondary
conservation areas (except that they shall include a fiftyfoot
deep greenway buffer along all banks of water bodies
and watercourses, and a fifty-foot greenway buffer
alongside wetland soils).
[3] The location of Secondary Conservation Areas shall be
guided by the maps and policies contained in the open
space and recreation element of the Township's
Comprehensive Plan, and typically include all or part of
the following kinds of resources: mature woodlands,
aquifer recharge areas, areas with highly permeable
("excessively drained") soil, significant wildlife habitat
areas, sites listed on the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity
Inventory, the Allegheny County Natural Heritage
Inventory, the Hampton Township Natural Areas Inventory,
prime farmland, historic, archaeological or cultural
features listed (or eligible to be listed) on national, state or
county registers or inventories, and scenic views into the
property from existing public roads.
§ 310-53 HAMPTON CODE § 310-53
C:720
[4] Although the resource lands listed as potential secondary
conservation areas may comprise more than half of the
remaining land on a development parcel (after primary
conservation areas have been deducted), no applicant
shall be required to designate more than 50% of that
remaining land as a secondary conservation area.
(c) General location standards. Subdivisions and planned
residential developments (PRDs) shall be designed around
both the primary and secondary conservation areas, which
together constitute the total required open space. The design
process should therefore commence with the delineation of all
potential open space, after which potential house sites are
located. Following that, access road alignments are identified,
with lot lines being drawn in as the final step. This "fourstep"
design process is further described below.
[1] Both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be
placed in undivided preserves, which may adjoin housing
areas that have been designed more compactly to create
larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of
the development.
[2] Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the
residents of the development. To achieve this, the majority
of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to
provide direct views and access. Safe and convenient
pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not
adjoining the open space shall be provided (except in the
case of farmland, or other resource areas vulnerable to
trampling damage or human disturbance). Where the
undivided open space is designated as separate,
noncontiguous parcels, no parcel shall consist of less than
three acres in area nor have a length-to-width ratio in
excess of 4:1, except such areas that are specifically
designed as village greens, ballfields, upland buffers to
wetlands, water bodies or watercourses, or designed as
trail links.
(d) Interconnected open space network. As these policies are
implemented, the protected open space in each new
subdivision will eventually adjoin each other, ultimately
forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary
conservation areas across the Township. To avoid the issue of
the "taking of land without compensation," the only elements
of this network that would necessarily be open to the public are
those lands that have been required to be dedicated for public
use, never more than 10% of a development parcel's gross
acreage, and typically configured in a linear fashion as an
element of the Township's long-range open space network.
§ 310-53 CHARTER § 310-53
C:721
F. Evaluation criteria. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the
following criteria will be considered by the Planning Commission and
the Environmental Advisory Council as indicating a design appropriate
to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the
purposes of this chapter. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be
encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between
development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the Planning
Commission and the Environmental Advisory Council shall evaluate
proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary
plan:
(1) Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes
from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be
approved by the Township for essential infrastructure, or active or
passive recreation amenities).
(2) Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields,
pastures, meadows, or orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas
to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses.
(3) If development is located on open fields or pastures, dwellings
should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations
at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads. Other
considerations include whether the development will be visually
buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen
consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and
wildflowers.
(4) Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species
vegetation of at least 50 feet in depth adjacent to all eddies and/or
banks of wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams,
springs, lakes and ponds.
(5) Minimizes impacts on woodlands and wooded areas, especially
those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife
habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. However,
woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential
can provide suitable locations for residential development. When
any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all
disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields,
etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife
areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
(6) Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted,
particularly as seen from public roadways. For example, in open
agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is
recommended along the public roadway where those views or
vistas are prominent or locally significant. In wooded areas where
the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a
deep "no-build, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve
existing vegetation.
§ 310-53 HAMPTON CODE § 310-53
C:722
(7) Avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by
taking advantage of lower topographic features.
(8) Protects wildlife habitat and biodiversity areas of species listed as
endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, by the Pennsylvania Natural
Diversity Inventory, by the Allegheny County Natural Heritage
Inventory, or the Hampton Township Natural Areas Inventory.
(9) Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or
cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard
the character of the feature.
(10) Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and
vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto
existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic
corridor of rural roads.
(11) Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac
islands, and both sides of new streets with native species shade
trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value.
(12) Provides active recreational areas, if desired, in suitable locations
offering convenient access by residents, and adequately screened
from nearby house lots.
(13) Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that
pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between
properties and activities or special features within the
neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should
connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential
open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open
space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
(14) Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous. For example,
fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these
resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located
in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent
practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with
logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of
conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature
is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with
other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut
existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels, and shall
be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway
systems, as per the policies in the open space and recreation
element of the Township's Comprehensive Plan.
G. Uses permitted in primary conservation lands.
(1) Conservation of open land in its natural state.
§ 310-53 CHARTER § 310-53
C:723
(2) Passive recreation such as hiking, nonmotorized biking on an
established trail, bird watching, and picnicking only.
(3) Buffer yards along tract boundaries.
(4) Easements for drainage, access, sewer or water lines, or other
public purposes.
(5) Underground utility and street rights-of-way may traverse
conservation areas if absolutely necessary, but shall not count
toward the minimum required.
H. Uses permitted in secondary conservation lands.
(1) The same as in Subsection G(1) above for primary conservation
lands.
(2) The same as in Subsection G(2) above for primary conservation
lands.
(3) The same as in Subsection G(3) above for primary conservation
lands.
(4) The same as in Subsection G(4) above for primary conservation
lands.
(5) Underground utility and street rights-of-way may traverse
conservation areas but shall not count toward the minimum
required SLC greenway land.
(6) Water supply and sewage disposal systems, and stormwater
detention areas, designed, landscaped, and available for use as an
integral part of the greenway. The acreage of land for these uses
will not be credited toward the minimum open space acreage
requirements unless the land is still appropriate for passive
recreational use, such as a retention pond which always holds
water.
(7) Neighborhood uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas,
community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact recreation uses,
specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles or bikes, rifle
ranges, and other uses similar in character and potential impact as
determined by the Township Council.
(8) Active noncommercial recreation areas, such as playing fields,
playgrounds, swimming pools, courts, and bikeways, provided such
areas do not consume more than half of the minimum required SLC
greenway land or five acres, whichever is less. Playing fields,
playgrounds, pools, and courts shall not be located within 100 feet
of abutting properties. Parking facilities for the same shall also be
permitted, and they shall generally be gravel surfaced, properly
drained, unlighted, provide safe ingress and egress and contain no
more than 10 parking places.
§ 310-53 HAMPTON CODE § 310-54
C:724
§ 310-54. Open space design review standards for conservation
subdivisions.
A. Prioritized list of resources to be conserved. The design of open space
lands in any conservation subdivision shall reflect the standards set
forth in Article IX of this chapter and, to the fullest extent possible,
incorporate any of the following resources if they occur on the tract
(listed in order of significance):
(1) Primary resources.
(a) Stream channels, floodplains, wetlands, swales, springs and
other lowland areas, including adjacent buffer areas which
may be required to insure their protection.
(b) Very steep slopes over 25%, especially those containing slideprone
soils or adjoining water resources.
(2) Secondary resources.
(a) Significant natural areas of species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern, such as those listed in the PA
Natural Diversity Inventory and the Allegheny County Natural
Heritage sites.
(b) Steep slopes, especially those which contain slide-prone soils,
and those adjoining watercourses and ponds, where
disturbance and resulting deforestation and soil erosion and
sedimentation could be detrimental to water quality.
(c) Healthy woodlands, particularly those performing important
ecological functions such as soil stabilization, protection of
streams, wetlands, and wildlife habitats. They also help hold
back stormwater flow.
(d) Large individual trees of botanic significance, groups of trees,
and other special vegetation features.
(e) Existing trails connecting the tract to other locations in the
Township.
(f) Visually prominent topographic features such as knolls,
hilltops and ridges, and scenic viewsheds as seen from public
roads.
(g) Areas where precipitation is most likely to recharge local
groundwater resources because of topographic and soil
conditions affording high rates of infiltration and percolation.
(h) Class I, II and III agricultural soils as defined by the USDA
Natural Resource Conservation Service.
(i) Historic structures and sites.
§ 310-54 CHARTER § 310-54
C:725
B. Other design considerations. The configuration of proposed greenway
lands set aside for common use in residential subdivisions shall comply
with the following standards:
(1) They shall be free of all structures except historic buildings, stone
walls, and structures related to greenway uses. The Township
Council may grant approval of structures and improvements
required for storm drainage, sewage treatment and water supply
within the open space provided that such facilities would not be
detrimental to the greenway (and that the acreage of lands
required for such uses is not credited towards minimum open space
acreage requirements for the tract, unless the land they occupy is
appropriate for passive recreational use).
(2) They shall generally not include parcels smaller than three acres,
have a length-to-width ratio of less than 4:1, or be less than 75 feet
in width, except for such lands specifically designed as
neighborhood greens, playing fields or trail links.
(3) They shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number
of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided
with safe and convenient pedestrian access to open space land.
(4) A portion shall be suitable for active recreational uses to the extent
deemed necessary by the Township Council, without interfering
with adjacent dwelling units, parking, driveways, and roads.
(5) They shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a
continuous network of greenway lands within and adjoining the
subdivision.
(6) They shall provide buffers to adjoining parks, preserves or other
protected lands.
(7) They shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the residents
of the subdivision. Consideration shall be given to providing for
public access on such trails if they are linked to other publicly
accessible pathway systems within the municipality. Provisions
should be made for access to the open space lands, as required for
land management and emergency purposes.
(8) To the greatest extent possible, they should be undivided by public
or private streets, except where necessary for proper traffic
circulation.
(9) They shall be suitably landscaped either by retaining existing
natural cover and wooded areas and/or according to a landscaping
plan to protect greenway resources.
(10) They shall be made subject to such agreement with the
municipality and such conservation easements duly recorded in the
office of the County Recorder of Deeds as may be required by

C. Ownership and maintenance. Applicants shall demonstrate compliance
with greenway ownership and maintenance standards in Article IX of
this chapter.
A. General. Different ownership and management options apply to the
permanently protected open space created through the development
process. The open space shall remain undivided and may be owned and
managed by a homeowners' association, the Township, or a recognized
land trust or conservancy. A public land dedication, not exceeding 10%
of the total parcel size, may be required by the Township through this
open space, to facilitate trail connections. A narrative describing
ownership, use and maintenance responsibilities shall be submitted for
all common and public improvements, utilities and open spaces.
B. Ownership standards. See § 310-47A(2) and (3), and § 310-47B and C.
These requirements will apply for this conservation subdivision section,
as well as to the planned residential developments (PRD).
C. Maintenance standards. The PRD requirements in § 310-47E(1) and (2)
will also apply to these conservation subdivisions.
A. With the exception of Table B,155 all the rest of Article IX shall apply, as

C:736
(1) The proposed development plan complies with all applicable
standards and conditions of this section, preserves the community
development objectives of Hampton Township and is found by
Township Council to be consistent with the Hampton Township
Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Where the proposed development plan departs from the
requirements of this section and the Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance162 otherwise applicable to the
subject lot, such departures are in the public interest and promote
the public's health, safety and welfare.
(3) The proposed uses shown on the development plan are permitted in
the underlying zoning district(s) in the development plan area.
Where the use has a spacing requirement from similar uses or
other uses it may be waived in a planned nonresidential
development.
(4) The proposals for the maintenance of any bufferyard and
landscaping areas are reliable and legally enforceable, and the
amount and extent of improvements of such open space and
landscaping areas are adequate with respect to the purpose, use
and type of development proposed.
(5) The physical design of the development plan adequately provides
for public services, traffic facilities and parking, light, air,
recreation and visual enjoyment.
(6) The total environment of the development plan is harmonious and
consistent with the zoning district(s) in which it is located and with
the surrounding zoning districts. The grant or denial of
development plan approval shall include findings of fact related to
the proposed development plan as may be submitted for approval,
and the reasons for the decisions shall be set forth with
particularity in what respect the proposed development plan would
or would not be in the public interest, including but not limited to
each of the above criteria.
B. In evaluating the conditional use criteria, the applicant shall
demonstrate, and Township Council shall consider the following
additional factors, where applicable:
(1) The degree to which development pursuant to a cohesive
development plan is expected to be superior to existing
development in the zoning district(s) under uncoordinated land
development plans.
(2) The degree to which a declaration of covenants, conditions and
restrictions (CCR) document is created and recorded against the
162. Editor's Note: See Ch. 280, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 310-57.16 CHARTER § 310-57.16
C:737
lot to govern development. Examples of items that would be
included in the CCR may include, but not be limited to:
(a) Architectural design standards (i.e., materials, colors, quality
of construction, maintenance, repair, etc.).
(b) Landscaping standards.
(c) Signage standards.
(d) Lighting standards.
(e) Other items deemed appropriate by Township Council.
(3) If the planned nonresidential development area abuts a residential
district, the degree that bufferyards are enhanced over the
minimum required in this chapter.
(4) The degree to which sensitive existing conditions are protected.
(5) The amount and nature of public facilities and right-of-way donated
to the Township or other public agency over and above what could
legally be required in a land development.
C. Township Council shall also consider the following criteria, which shall
be encouraged, but not required:
(1) The use of parking structures to minimize surface parking lots.
(2) The use of innovative stormwater management techniques, such as
best management practices (BMPs), groundwater recharging,
green roofs, etc.
(3) The degree to which pedestrian circulation is proposed to interconnect
the lots within the development plan.
(4) The degree that the development plan may assist in attracting
similar uses to adjacent land.
(5) The degree to which the use of the lot will generate tax revenue for
the Township.
(6) The degree to which the development is expected to create new
jobs.
(7) The degree to which mixed-use buildings and/or activities are
incorporated into the overall development plan.
D. Residential use above the first/ground floor of any building may be
permitted in a development plan area when:
(1) The total square footage devoted to the residential use in the
development plan area does not exceed 25% of the total area
encompassed by the development plan.
§ 310-57.16 HAMPTON CODE § 310-57.16
C:738
(2) Adequate protections from noise, light, vibration, hours of
operation, truck and equipment traffic and surrounding residential
uses are provided. It is the intent of this subsection that residential
uses are secondary to the uses permitted in the zoning district(s)
and such residential use would be not subject to impacts that would
not be acceptable in residentially zoned districts. Township Council
may require that notice of this fact be made part of any recorded
covenants for the development planned area.
(3) Adequate outdoor recreational areas are provided.
(4) The use provisions of this section are complied with.
(5) The height of a structure does not exceed 35 feet.
E. The applicant shall submit an updated development plan each time one
of the following events occurs:
(1) The uses proposed in the development plan change in trip
generation character and impact such that more than 100 new
peak hour trips would be generated.
(2) The total development plan area devoted to bufferyards and
landscaping is decreased by more than 5%. See Part 2 of this
chapter for minimum bufferyard and landscaping requirements.
(3) The quantity of grading shown on the development plan/grading
plan is increased by more than 5%.
(4) Any access point to an existing public street is moved or removed to
such an extent that in the opinion of the Township Traffic Engineer
a greater impact on abutting lots will result.
(5) The parcelization on the development plan is changed such that, in
the opinion of the Township Traffic Engineer, the street and
circulation system within the development plan area is inadequate
to meet traffic demands generated in the development plan area.
(6) Twenty-five percent of the development plan area by building
square footage is completed; provided, however, if no changes in
use or parcel sizes have occurred from the time of the last
development plan approval, the applicant shall so notify the
Township Zoning Officer in writing and the Township Zoning
Officer may waive this requirement.
(7) Where a development plan is being updated and a lot has been
developed and has received a certificate of occupancy, only the
outlines of the lot need to be shown on the development plan with
reference to the land development plan as recorded in the
Allegheny County Recorder's Office. For modifications other than
those listed above, approval of a land development for a lot within
the development plan area serves as a revision to the previously
approved development plan as to that lot.

the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the
common open space as related to the purpose, density and type
of development.
(d) The physical design of the proposed PNRD and the aspects in
which said design does or does not make adequate provision
for public services, provided adequate control over vehicular
traffic, and further amenities of light and air, recreation, and
visual enjoyment.
(e) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed PNRD
to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established.
(f) The sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect
the interest of the public and the residents of the PNRD and
the integrity of the development plan.
(4) Status of plan after tentative approval.
(a) The official written communication provided for this section
shall be certified by the Township Land Use Administrator and
shall be filed in the Township office and a certified copy shall
be mailed to the applicant.
(b) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a
plan of the PNRD for recording nor authorize development or
the issuance of any building permits. A development plan
which has been given tentative approval with conditions which
have been accepted by the applicant and provided that the
applicant has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions
of the tentative approval shall not be modified or revoked nor
otherwise impaired by action of the Township pending an
application or applications for final approval, without the
consent of the applicant, provided an application for final
§ 310-57.17 CHARTER § 310-57.17
C:743
§ 310-57.18. Application for final PNRD approval.
approval is filed, or in the case of development over a period
of years, provided applications are filed within the periods of
time specified in the official written communication granting
tentative approval.
(c) In the event that a development plan is given tentative
approval and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the
applicant shall elect to abandon said development plan and
shall so notify the Township in writing, or in the event the
applicant shall fail to file application or applications for final
approval within the required period of time or times, as the
case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be
revoked and all that portion of the area included in the
development plan for which final approval has not been given
shall be subject to those ordinances otherwise applicable
thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and the
same shall be noted in the records of the Township Land Use
Administrator.
(5) Timing. If a proposed PNRD is granted tentative approval, with or
without conditions, Township Council may set forth in the official
written communication the time within which an application for
final approval shall be filed. In the case of a development plan,
which provides for development over a period of years, the periods
of time in which applications for final approval of each part thereof
shall be filed may also be established in the official written
communication. Only with the consent of the applicant may the
time between grant of tentative approval and application for final
approval be less than three months, and in the case of development
over a period of years, the time between applications for final
approval of each part of a plan shall not be less than 12 months.

appeal by the same procedures and with the same limitations as
provided for zoning appeals by the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
G. Failure to develop. In the event that a development plan, or a section
thereof, is given final approval and thereafter the applicant shall
abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been finally
approved, or in the event the applicant shall fail to commence
development of the planned nonresidential development within two
years after final approval has been granted, or in the event that the
applicant shall substantially fail to develop in accordance with the

development shall take place on the lot included in the development
plan until after the said lot is reclassified by enactment of an
amendment to this chapter.
H. Enforcement remedies.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
the PNRD provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township
as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed,
levied or be payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither
pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the magisterial district judge, determining that
there has been a violation, further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating
this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the magisterial district judge and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
§ 310-57.18 CHARTER § 310-57.18
C:747
violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the Township. The
Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant
an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine
pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.

Supplemental Requirements
§ 310-58. Lot requirements.
A. Existing lots of record less in area or frontage than permitted. When a
lot occurs in any zone district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted and was recorded with Allegheny County prior to adoption of
this chapter but contains less area and/or has less frontage abutting a
public or private road that has been established by this chapter for the
zoning district where the lot is located, such a lot may be developed
without need for a variance, provided:
(1) The lot does not abut, along a common side property line, another
lot or lots in the same ownership at the time development was
proposed, and which if combined with the first lot, would produce a
property meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of the
zone district;
(2) No further reduction in depth of front, side or rear yards is needed
to accomplish development; and
(3) The lot abuts an improved street accepted by the Township or
meets all the requirements for a private street contained in the
current Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development, and can
meet at least 70% of the bulk and area requirements for the zoning
district the property is located in.
B. Minimum lot size/space for on-lot septic systems. When a property is
dependent upon on-lot sewage disposal, it shall not be developed unless
it contains at least one acre of area, width at the front lot line of at least
150 feet, provided that any regulations in the zone district containing
the property do not require a larger area or greater frontage than is
herein required, and has received an on-lot septic system permit from
the Allegheny County Health Department. A property of sufficient area
already recorded at the time of adoption of this chapter, but proposed
for development lacking access to public sewers, may be developed if
found acceptable for on-lot sewage disposal after percolation tests or
"open pit tests" as prescribed by the Allegheny County Department of
Health and receipt of a permit from the Allegheny County Department
of Health.
C. Lot frontage measurement. Lot frontage shall be measured along the
street right-of-way line abutting the property, except that developers
owning lots abutting a cul-de-sac portion of the street may use the
distance between side lot lines measured along the front setback line as
the lot frontage measurement, provided the lot has at least 30 feet
frontage on the abutting street right-of-way. Landowners wishing to
develop lots abutting the cul-de-sac portion of a street may use the
distance between the side lot lines measured along the front setback
line, provided the distance along the front setback line equals or
§ 310-58 CHARTER § 310-58
C:749
§ 310-59. Yard requirements.
Refer to Figure 1 to determine the front, side, and rear yard areas of a lot.
exceeds the required frontage measurement in the zoning district,
and provided further that the lot has at least 30 feet frontage on the
abutting cul-de-sac line, and provided further that the lot meets all area
and bulk requirements for the zoning district.
D. Structures within easements and rights-of-way.
(1) No structures, temporary or permanent, shall be placed within any
easement or right-of-way utilized for the purposes of, but not
limited to, ingress, egress, sanitary sewer lines, storm sewer lines,
drainage, or other utilities.
(2) Unless determined by the Zoning Officer to be detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the public, mailboxes, landscaping,
etc., may be placed within said areas, but shall be placed at the
owner's own risk. The property owner shall be solely liable for any
harm to person or property caused by the placement of such
structures and shall be solely responsible for any and all damage
caused to such structures by Township or others entering the
easement or right-of-way to maintain or service utilities or public
improvements therein and for all costs associated with the removal
or replacement of such structures. However, masonry type
construction of any type is prohibited within a ROW. [Amended
5-24-2017 by Ord. No. 796]
E. Mobile home parks: see § 310-78A(32).
A. Corner. In lots that abut two streets intersecting at one corner of the
property, the setback from each street to the building line shall be the
front yard setback for the zone district containing the lot. The side yard
setback requirements for the zoning district shall be used as the rear
yard setback and for the remaining side yards.
B. Front yards on undeveloped lots. Where an undeveloped lot occurs
between two developed lots which are not in conformance with existing
setbacks, the developer may place a principal structure on the
undeveloped lot setback from the front lot line the average distance of
the setback of the two adjacent principal structures, but not less than
15 feet.
C. Variations in side yards permitted. When a proposed side wall of an
existing structure or a proposed addition is not parallel to the adjacent
side lot line, the structure may be placed so that the average distance of
the nearer and further corners of the side wall to the side lot line equals
or exceeds the required side yard setback for the zone district
containing the lot but in no case shall any point of the structure be
closer than 1/2 the required side yard setback for the zone district or 10
feet, whichever is greater. [Amended 9-27-2017 by Ord. No. 797]
§ 310-58 HAMPTON CODE § 310-59
C:750
D. Projections into required yards.
(1) All projections from the wall surface of a primary residential
structure, including but not limited to chimneys, canopies, eaves,
cornices, stairwells, fire escapes, bay windows, balconies, porches
or patios, whether such projections reach to the ground or not,
shall be considered a part of the structure in determining setbacks
from property lines. However, such projections may extend not
more than two feet into required yard areas, provided such
projections, except eaves, are not more than six feet in width.
(2) Pool filters and air-conditioning units shall be set back as far as
accessory structures from property and street right-of-way lines
and, in addition, shall be screened by evergreen landscaping or a
low wall to reduce noise and visual intrusion.
(3) Satellite dishes. For the purpose of this chapter, satellite dishes
shall meet the following requirements:
(a) Ground-mounted.
[1] No dish shall be constructed in any front or side yard, but
shall be constructed to the rear of the residence or main
structure. Satellite dishes may only be placed in any front
or side yard if the quality of the reception is impaired or
prevented, based on the documentation of a satellite dish
provider or installer and accompanying affidavit, duly
notarized, indicating that the quality of the reception
would be impaired or prevented.
[2] The dish, including its concrete base slab or other
structure, shall meet the rear and side yard setbacks for all
accessory structures in the zoning district where located.
[3] No dish shall be linked, physically or electronically to a
receiver which is not located on the same lot, premises or
parcel of land as is the earth station.
[4] A dish shall not exceed a grade height of 12 feet.
[5] All structural supports shall be of galvanized metal.
[6] Wiring between a dish and a receiver shall be placed at
least four inches beneath the surface of the ground within
rigid conduit.
[7] A dish must be bonded to a grounding rod.
(b) Roof-mounted.
[1] Satellite dishes shall be mounted directly upon the roof of
a primary or accessory structure as defined in the building
§ 310-59 CHARTER § 310-59
C:751
code,164 and shall not be mounted upon appurtenances
such as towers, trees, poles or spires.
[2] A dish shall not exceed a height of more than three feet
above the roof upon which it is mounted.
[3] A dish shall not exceed three feet in diameter.
[4] A dish must be bonded to a grounding rod.

E. Buffer yards shall be required along entire perimeter in conjunction
with the development of any property, except with the development of
property for single-family detached residential dwellings, as shown on
the following Table E. Required or granted buffer yards shall be
included in land development plans as a conservation easement for any
single-family developments and shall be recorded as part of any
approved plan. [Amended 5-24-2017 by Ord. No. 796]

(1) The type of buffer yard for the property being developed shall be
based upon the zoning district classification of the adjoining
property, not the use of the adjoining property.
(2) In some instances, the existing natural topography and vegetation
on the site may fulfill the buffer yard requirements, if: the required
distance from any side or rear lot lines are met; the area is
adequately treed; and the existing topography and vegetation
provide a visual screen, which, in the opinion of the Environmental
Advisory Council and Township Council, is at least equivalent to the
required buffer yard.

§ 310-59 CHARTER § 310-59
C:755
10-9
(3) Buffer yards defined. The buffer yards identified in § 310-59E,
listed as A, B, C, and D, are hereby defined as follows, and can be
viewed in Table D. Low-level shrubs, hedges or mounds shall be of
such height that a person facing a passenger car with the shrubs,
hedges or mound between him/her and the car could observe the
car's low-beam lights only as a result of the diffused or reflected
light from the headlights and not because the main, direct beam
from those lights was observable. Ground cover is required for
each buffer yard. If vegetative cover is used, the maintenance of
the ground cover shall be in conformance with the then-adopted
version of the IPMC.
(a) Buffer yard A.
[1] No structures or uses, including but not limited to,
buildings, accessory structures, parking spaces, access
drives and lighting devices, may be located closer than 35
feet to any side or rear lot line; provided, however, that if
the width of any such buffer yard would exceed,
respectively, more than 10% of the width or depth of the
subject lot as it existed as of the effective date of this
§ 310-59 HAMPTON CODE § 310-59
C:756
chapter, measured along a perpendicular line running
from the relevant side or rear lot line, then the size of
the buffer yard shall be established through the following
formula.
[2] On a lot or property with a width or depth of greater than
250 feet, but less than 350 feet, the buffer yard required
shall be 10% of that minimum dimension on that particular
side of the property. For example, on lots with a width
greater than 350 feet, the buffer yard for the rear yard
shall be 10% of the depth of the property. The buffer yards
for the side yards shall remain the minimum requirement
of 35 feet. On a lot with a width of less than 350 feet, and a
depth greater than 350 feet, the buffer yards on the side
yards shall be 10% of the width of the property. The buffer
yard for the rear yard shall remain the minimum
requirement of 35 feet. In no event, however, shall the side
or rear buffer yard be less than 25 feet.
[3] This buffer yard shall contain two rows of trees. Each row
shall consist of a mixture of deciduous (40%) and
evergreen (60%) trees, spaced within the row, 15 feet
apart, measured from the vertical center line of adjacent
trees. The two rows shall be staggered in the manner
shown on the drawings in Table D, which shall result in
adjacent trees in the two different rows being no more
than 7.5 feet apart, measured from the vertical center line
of the trees.
[4] In addition to the above-noted required trees, a row of lowlevel
evergreen shrubs or hedges shall be planted, or
earthen mounding shall be constructed in the buffer yard
which will provide a year-round visual screen capable of
acting as a barrier to light beams emanating from the
headlights of passenger cars.
(b) Buffer yard B.
[1] No structures or uses, including but not limited to,
buildings, accessory structures, parking spaces, access
drives, and lighting devices, may be located closer than 25
feet to any side or rear lot line.
[2] This twenty-five-foot buffer yard shall contain a row of
plantings which shall be comprised of a mixture of
deciduous (40%) and evergreen (60%) trees. These trees
shall be spaced 15 feet apart measured from the center of
the trees.
[3] In addition to the above-noted required trees, a row of lowlevel
evergreen shrubs or hedges shall be planted, or
earthen mounding shall be constructed in the buffer yard
§ 310-59 CHARTER § 310-59
C:757
which shall provide a year-round visual screen capable
of acting as a barrier to light beams emanating from the
headlights of passenger cars.
(c) Buffer yard C.
[1] No structures or uses, including but not limited to
buildings, accessory structures, parking spaces, and
lighting devices, may be located any closer than 15 feet to
any side or rear lot line. Interconnecting access drives
between development sites may be permitted to extend
through the buffer yard. Plantings required within this
area shall be relocated in another area of the site.
[2] This fifteen-foot buffer yard shall contain a row of planting
which shall be comprised of a mixture of deciduous (40%)
and evergreen (60%) trees. These trees shall be spaced 15
feet apart measured from the center of the trees.
[3] In addition to the above-noted required trees, a row of lowlevel
evergreen shrubs or hedges shall be planted or
earthen mounding shall be constructed in the buffer yard
which shall provide a year-round visual screen capable of
acting as a barrier to light beams emanating from the
headlights of passenger cars.
(d) Buffer yard D. No structures or uses, including but not limited
to buildings, accessory structures, parking spaces, and lighting
devices, may be located any closer than 10 feet to any side or
rear lot line. Interconnecting access drives between
development sites may be permitted to extend through the
buffer yard. Plantings required within this area shall be
relocated in another area of the site. This ten-foot buffer yard
shall contain a row of planting which shall be comprised of
deciduous (40%) and evergreen (60%) trees. These trees shall
be spaced no more than 15 feet apart measured from the
center of the trees.
(e) Creativity in design is encouraged. Planting of a different
configuration may substitute for any required buffer yard,
subject to the approval of the Township Council, the proposed
design accomplished everything meant to be accomplished by
the above standard buffer yard plantings, i.e., screening,
improved aesthetics, etc.
(f) All buffer yards, as required, shall be provided by the
developer or applicant/owner of the subject parcel during the
initial phase of construction, where a project is developed in
phases, and maintained throughout the development period
and thereafter.
§ 310-59 HAMPTON CODE § 310-59
C:758
(4) When the yard width specified In Subsection E(3)(a) through (d) is
in conflict with the provision of Table A165 or any other ordinance of
the Township of Hampton, the greater distance shall apply. The
planting requirement shall be adhered to regardless of the yard
requirement.
(5) In instances where an existing structure houses the principal use of
the property, and is located within any required buffer yard, a
buffer yard of not less than the minimum distance from the existing
structure to the property line shall be required. This reduced buffer
yard width shall apply only to the yard area in which the existing
structure encroaches. If the existing structure is located within the
required buffer yard on one side of the building, the required buffer
yard, as determined by § 310-59E, shall apply on all other yard
areas. All planting requirements shall be adhered to regardless of
the buffer yard width.
(6) All yard areas not utilized for parking facilities, driveways, gardens,
the planting of trees or shrubs, perennials, or similar uses, must be
seeded, sodded, or landscaped within a reasonable period of time.
"Reasonable period of time" shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis and based upon existing weather conditions and forecasts.
(a) The required plantings of trees and/or shrubs must occur as
long as, or as soon as, the soil is not frozen to a depth greater
than two inches; and
(b) The required sodding or seeding, and/or planting of perennials,
must occur by October 15 or by the end of April, whichever
most immediately follows the initial occupancy.
(7) Where trees already exist, as defined by Subsection E(9) below,
within the required buffer yard, these trees shall remain
undisturbed, except that diseased or dead material may be
removed. If it is determined that some healthy trees must be
removed in conjunction with development, a written request to
remove such trees must be submitted to the Township, along with
an explanation detailing the rationale for the request. These trees
shall not be removed until the Township has given written
authorization permitting the removal. This permission will not be
unreasonably denied; however, those who violate this section shall
be subject to a maximum penalty authorized by this chapter. When
any trees, regardless of their physical condition, are removed, they
shall be replaced by trees suitable to the environment. All such
replacement planting shall be in accordance with accepted
conservation practices.
(8) All trees required to be planted within the buffer yard shall be a
minimum of one-and-one-half-inch caliper and shall be planted in
165. Editor's Note: Table A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 310-59 CHARTER § 310-59

§ 310-60. Height requirements.
accordance with accepted conservation practices. All required
trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height at time of planting,
measured from the ground adjacent to the planted tree to the top
of the tree.
(9) Any existing trees within the required buffer yard which are a
minimum of four inches DBH shall be preserved and shall count as
a required tree within the buffer yard. At no point, however, shall
any required additional trees be separated at a distance greater
than the distance specified in the required buffer yard.
(10) It shall be the responsibility of the owner/applicant to assure the
continued growth of all required landscaping and/or to replace the
same in the event of frost, vandalism, disease or other reasons for
the discontinued growth of the required trees, shrubs or bushes. A
six-month time table for the replacement of diseased or dead plants
shall be observed from the date of Township notification about this
condition.
(11) Stormwater management facilities and associated structures may
be maintained within a buffer yard, but the existence of such
facilities or structures shall not be a basis for a failure to meet the
planting requirements.
A. See Article IV, Definitions.
B. Maximum heights allowed.
(1) See Table A.166
(2) For accessory uses, the maximum height shall be 20 feet, not to
exceed one story. Accessory structure height is the vertical
distance measured between the average of the highest and lowest
elevation at ground level to the highest overall point of the
structure. [Amended 9-27-2017 by Ord. No. 797]
(3) Signs shall not exceed the height limitation for permitted uses.
(4) Refer also to § 310-78A(37) relating to wireless communication
towers and equipment.
(5) In PRDs in all areas, except RA and RB, a fourth story may be
permitted for equipment servicing the building, provided it is
properly housed, and which shall not exceed the 10 feet in height,
and which may be added to the third floor. Decorative domes may
be permitted, provided that the same shall not be habitable, and
which shall likewise not exceed 10 feet in additional height, but
which may be added to a third floor.

C:760
§ 310-61. Natural features.
All subdivisions and land developments shall be designed to minimize
environmental damage, by carefully fitting the subdivision or development
to the natural environment of the site. The purpose of the regulations in this
section is to avoid hazardous development, protect natural resources, and
promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
C. Height exceptions.
(1) Chimneys, exhaust stacks, church steeples, roof-mounted airhandling
equipment, and communications equipment shall be
exempt from maximum height requirements after review of the
proposal by the Planning Commission and approval by Township
Council based on location of the structure in relation to
neighboring properties and streets, and height related to function.
If such structures exceed 35 feet in height above the ground, they
shall not be approved unless application for construction is
accompanied by a written opinion of a registered professional
engineer attesting to the ability of the structure to withstand
maximum forces upon it as to wind, ice and snow loads. Township
Council may, where roof-mounted equipment will be visible from a
public street, and after favorable review of the proposal by the
Planning Commission and Environmental Advisory Council, require
that such equipment be screened or hidden from view, or organized
in arrangement to be visually acceptable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall chimneys, exhaust stacks and roofmounted
equipment exceed a height above the building by a
distance, equal to 1/2 of the height of the building (from ground
level) upon which such structure is to be placed.
(2) Church steeples shall in no event exceed a height in excess of 75
feet from ground level of the church structure; communications
facilities in no event shall exceed a height of 200 feet from ground
level, except for communications facilities designed and intended
for use by governmental or quasi-governmental entities, such as
police, emergency medical communications, public works,
communications, etc.
A. Protection of watercourses and wetlands. The purpose of the
regulations in this section are to ensure that watercourses and
wetlands will be preserved so that they may continue to convey and
store water, provide habitat for flora and fauna, and serve as
recreational and aesthetic resources. Any proposed encroachment on
lakes, ponds, watercourses, floodplains or wetlands shall be regulated
as per Chapter 155, Flood Damage Prevention, as amended, and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
encroachment regulations.
(1) Uses permitted in floodways.
§ 310-60 CHARTER § 310-61
C:761
(a) All four uses listed below and no others are permitted in the
floodway, provided that no increase in the base flood elevation
will result:
[1] Recreation uses such as: parks, picnic grounds, hiking and
riding trails, fishing areas, wildlife sanctuaries, nature
preserves and swimming areas.
[2] Construction of crossings of the floodway by roads,
bridges and utility transmission areas.
[3] Installation and maintenance of utility lines.
[4] Dams and impoundment basins.
(b) Uses of Subsection A(1)(a)[1], [2], [3] and [4] above shall be
permitted only after the developer shall submit to the
Township Engineer a copy of a water obstructions and
encroachment permit from the Pennsylvania DEP, Division of
Dams and Waterway Management, for the proposed use within
the floodway, or evidence from said Department that such
permit is not required.
(c) The following shall not be placed or caused to be placed in the
designated floodway: fences, except two-wire fences; other
matters which may impede, retard, or change the direction of
the flow of water or that will catch or collect debris carried by
such water, or that is placed where the natural flow of the
stream or floodwater would carry the same downstream to the
damage or detriment of either public or private property
adjacent to the floodway.
(2) Uses permitted in floodplain area. The following uses and no others
are permitted in the floodplain area:
(a) Uses permitted within the floodway area as provided in
Subsection A(1)(a) above.
(b) Sewage treatment plants and pumping stations when
constructed to prevent flooding of facilities.
(c) Oil and gas development and production when constructed in
accordance with conditional use requirements and DEP
regulations to prevent flooding of facilities. [Added
8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 827]
(3) Nonconforming structures and uses (preexisting) in the floodway
and floodplain shall be regulated as per Chapter 155, Flood
Damage Prevention, as amended, and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
§ 310-61 HAMPTON CODE § 310-61
C:762
(4) No filling, piping, draining or diverting shall be permitted in
wetlands, ponds or lakes unless a permit is obtained from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
(5) Setback or open space easement required. No grading, cutting,
filling, removal of vegetation, or other disturbance shall be
permitted within 50 feet of the top of the bank of any watercourse
or within 100 feet of any pond, lake or wetland. [Amended
5-24-2017 by Ord. No. 796]
(a) In larger subdivisions and land developments, the required
setback area should be integrated into a system of open space.
In smaller subdivisions and land developments, the
preservation of these open space areas shall be ensured
through recorded easements, deed restrictions, or other means
acceptable to the Township Council and upon review of the
EAC.
(b) Where the required setback or easement would render a site
unusable under existing zoning regulation because of the
limited size or dimensions of a parcel of land prior to its
subdivision, Township Council may reduce the setback to no
less than 25 feet along pond, lake, or wetland edges. Any
reduction in depth of setback which may be allowed by
Township Council does not supersede any requirement for a
greater setback imposed by federal or state regulations.
(c) Minor earth disturbance and construction within the area of
the required setback or easement, required for access for
development in other areas of the site, may be allowed in
accordance with all regulations of the Department of
Environmental Protection and Township floodway or floodplain
regulations.
(6) Alteration of drainage. When a proposed subdivision or land
development encompasses or adjoins a watercourse, wetland, or
springs area, the design of the proposed development shall ensure
that site drainage is not altered in ways that will reduce the ability
of any watercourse or wetland to support the vegetation and animal
life that characterized the area before development.
B. Erosion, sedimentation and stormwater runoff from any property shall
be controlled as per Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development,
and the Township's Grading Ordinance167 and in accordance with the
regulations of Pennsylvania Code Title 25, Chapter 102. All
earthmoving activities, regardless of size, must have the appropriate
erosion and sediment control BMPs implemented and maintained. The
Township will require the submittal of a written erosion and
167. Editor's Note: See Ch. 161, Grading and Excavation.
§ 310-61 CHARTER § 310-61
C:763
sedimentation control plan for all earth disturbances exceeding the
minimum area of disturbance listed in Chapter 102.
C. Protection of significant natural areas.
(1) Every subdivision and land development site plan shall consider,
protect, and, to the maximum extent feasible, ensure the
preservation of the natural areas and resources that are identified
in the following:
(a) The Allegheny County Natural Heritage Inventory, February
1994, prepared for Allegheny County by the Western
Pennsylvania Conservancy.
(b) The Hampton Natural Areas Inventory list of prime areas for
preservation, as prepared in 1994 by the Hampton EAC survey
of natural areas.
(2) Where a proposed subdivision or land development includes an
identified natural feature, such as a rare or endangered species,
which is regulated by municipal, state, or federal law, the applicant
shall provide evidence of compliance with any applicable
regulation.
(3) Where proposed development sites include identified natural
resources that are not protected or regulated by municipal, state or
federal law, the development plan shall incorporate preservation of
the feature as an element in the site design, to the maximum extent
feasible.
(4) Wherever possible, prime scenic views from roads and/or hilltops
shall be preserved for public enjoyment.
(5) Applicants for approval of subdivisions and land developments are
urged to include open space areas and facilities to meet the
recreational needs of residents and other users of the proposed
development. Recreational use may be made of areas where
development is restricted for environmental reasons. There may be
opportunities to link open space within a development to open
space in adjoining areas and to create, over time, continuous
systems of open space that will add great value to the development
and to the community.
D. Steep slopes and very steep slopes shall be protected as follows:
(1) Very steep slopes (over 25%): no environmental disturbance of any
kind shall be permitted on these areas.
(2) Steep slopes (15% to 25%), where any portion of the steep slope
contains soils identified on the Township of Hampton Soils Maps as
having a high landslide-prone risk; no environmental disturbance
of any kind shall be permitted in the steep slope areas containing
the high-risk landslide-prone soils.
§ 310-61 HAMPTON CODE § 310-61
C:764
(3) Steep slopes (15% to 25%), where any portion of the steep slope
contains soils identified on the Township of Hampton Soils Maps as
having a moderate landslide-prone risk; disturbances not
exceeding 25% of the steep slope areas containing the moderaterisk
landslide-prone soils may be permitted, provided the applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer and
Township Council that such disturbances will not adversely impact
the stability of the soils.
(4) Steep slopes (15% to 25%), not involving any areas identified on
the Township of Hampton Soils Maps as having landslide-prone
soils: no more than 50% of the steep slope area may be
environmentally disturbed.
(5) In instances where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Township Council that no adverse environmental impacts will
occur, the determination of the percent slope may be calculated
using the average percent slope. (See Article IV, Terminology,
§ 310-11, the definition of "slope" for the formula to calculate this.)
Use of the average percent slope may be utilized, provided that the
following has been taken into consideration for making the
judgment:
(a) The average percent slope has been calculated for the area of
disturbance (See Article IV, Terminology, § 310-11, the
definition of "slope" for slope formula).
(b) If the average percent slope is between 15% and 25%, the total
amount of disturbance of these slopes can be either 50% (if no
sliding soils) or 25% (if moderate sliding soils), as in
Subsection D(3) and (4) above.
(c) In the case of 15% to 25% slopes that have a high landslide
risk, or very steep slopes over 25%, Council shall also look at
the total area of the proposed disturbance in relation to the
total area of the entire site and base their decision on the total
amount of overall disturbance to the site, the least possible
disturbance being the goal.
(d) In the case of 25% and over slopes which are also shown to
have landslide-prone soils, such a waiver should only be given
in the instance of an extremely difficult site from the
standpoint of environmental constraints, and then given only
for the minimum amount of disturbance needed for the owner
to realize a reasonable use and monetary return for his
property.
(6) Landslide-prone soils shall be further protected, and excavations,
cuts and fills shall be regulated, as per the Township's Grading and
Excavating Ordinance.168
168. Editor's Note: See Ch. 161, Grading and Excavation.
§ 310-61 CHARTER § 310-61
C:765
E. Preservation of historic and/or architectural resources.
(1) Structures of known historic or architectural significance and
location of known or probable archaeological sites shall be
identified on the existing conditions map and described in the
preliminary application materials.
(2) Where the presence of such features is known or suspected, or
where required by DEP or another permitting agency, the applicant
shall notify the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission
(PHMC) of the proposed development and request a determination
concerning the presence of significant resources from the PHMC.
(a) A copy of the notification to the PHMC shall be submitted with
the application for preliminary approval.
(b) Township Council shall condition preliminary approval upon
the applicant's receipt from PHMC of a determination that:
[1] No significant resources are present on the site or that the
proposed-development will not adversely impact resources
that may be present; or
[2] Significant resources are present or likely to be present on
the site; together with an approved plan or program for
the mitigation of any adverse impacts of the proposed
development upon the historic or archaeological resource.
[3] A copy of the required determination by the PHMC shall be
submitted with an application for final approval, and no
development requiring such a determination shall be
finally approved without it.
F. Vegetation shall be protected as follows:
(1) Preservation of large or unique trees. All healthy trees with trunks
equal to, or exceeding 24 inches DBH, or any tree which may be
noteworthy because of its species, age, uniqueness, rarity, or status
as a landmark due to historical or other cultural associations, and
which is located within the area of disturbance, shall be preserved
unless removal is deemed absolutely necessary. Criteria for
evaluating the necessity for removal shall include the following:
(a) The health of the tree, whether it is dead or diseased beyond
remedy, or whether it is likely to endanger the public or an
adjoining property.
(b) Other constraints of the site, where the applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of Township Council that no
reasonable alternative exists and that removal of a tree is
necessary for construction of building foundation, roads,
trenching for utilities, or other essential improvements.
§ 310-61 HAMPTON CODE § 310-61
C:766
(c) In the case where the required replacement ratio will exceed
the capacity of the site.
(2) Large or unique trees which cannot be preserved shall be replaced,
either with identical species or with a mix of equally long-lived
native species as follows:
(a) For every tree with a twenty-four-inch DBH or larger, at least
six trees with a minimum caliper of 1 1/2 inch; or shrubs may
be substituted for up to four of the six replacement trees at a
ratio of 2:1.
(b) The placement and spacing of the replacement trees shall be
subject to the approval of Township Council and advice from
the EAC, but shall at a minimum be such to ensure the health
and longevity of the replacement trees.
(3) Preservation of other trees and vegetation in general. No removal
of trees, shrubbery, foliage, grass, or other natural growth shall be
permitted, except in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter of the Township of Hampton regulating land use and
development, except that the activity of grubbing shall be
permitted.
(4) The mass or large-scale cutting of trees and clearing of vegetation
for the sole purpose of clearing land, unless incidental to imminent
development, is prohibited. "Grubbing," as defined, is permitted for
aesthetic, safety or other concerns. This language is not intended
to prohibit the culling of diseased, dead or dying plants or trees;
the development of flower or vegetable gardens; the removal of
single trees or clumps of vegetation for aesthetic, safety or other
concerns. It prohibits the mass or large-scale defoliation of
property preparatory to development until 30 days before the
proposed development actually takes place.
(5) In addition to the large or unique trees in Subsection F(1):
(a) Existing trees which are six inches DBH or more shall be
preserved unless they are located in the actual space to be
occupied by a structure, or unless it can be clearly shown to be
detrimental to the proposed development.
(b) Existing trees which are 12 inches to 24 inches DBH and are
removed for development shall be replaced with an identical
species, or equally long-lived tree species, with a minimum
two-and-one-half-inch caliper on a one-for-one basis.
(6) All trees to be preserved shall be protected during construction by
utilizing the following procedures:
(a) The critical root zone shall be protected by securely staked
fencing with a minimum height of 36 inches surrounding the
§ 310-61 CHARTER § 310-61
C:767
tree, or tree area, at a minimum, distance of the tree's drip
line. No storage or placement of any soil or construction
materials, including construction wastes, shall occur within
the fenced area. Cables, ropes, signs and fencing shall not be
placed on protected trees.
(b) The operation of heavy equipment over root systems of such
trees shall be minimized in order to prevent soil compaction.
(c) Where existing ground levels are raised, drainage tiles shall be
placed vertically at old soil level and tops brought up to the
surface of the ground and filled with course, crushed stone or
gravel. The tiles should be placed to the perimeter of the drip
line of the tree at a maximum of four feet apart.
(7) Any tree trunks or exposed roots which are damaged during
construction shall be protected from further damage by being
treated immediately with professional procedures.
(8) Nondormant trees shall be given an application of a more
phosphorus-based fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible
damage caused by construction operations.
(9) Any existing trees which are to remain on the site, according to the
approved site plan, shall be immediately marked on the site in some
bold manner, so that they are not cut down in error. In the event
that any of these trees designated to remain are cut down or killed
during construction, they shall be replaced with the same species
as follows:
(a) In the case of mature and larger trees, but less than 24 inches
DBH, the minimum size allowed for a replacement shall be at
least three inches in caliper for deciduous and 10 feet in height
for coniferous trees.
(b) This replacement requirement does not supersede Subsection
F(2) requirements for replacing unique or twenty-four-inch or
larger DBH trees.
G. Disturbance of existing biological communities on the site shall be
minimized, such that, except where clearly infeasible or in conflict with
other Township objectives of higher priority, the most mature ecological
community on a site after development must be as mature as that
before development.
H. All disturbed topsoil shall be stockpiled, protected from erosion, and
replaced after construction on the site over all graded, nondeveloped
areas so that there might be approximately four inches of topsoil there.
I. Avoidance of hazardous development.
(1) Flood-prone areas. Regulated as per Subsection A and Chapter
155, Flood Damage Prevention, as amended.
§ 310-61 HAMPTON CODE § 310-61
C:768
(2) Undermined areas. No land development involving the
construction of buildings and no subdivision of land intended to
create lots for building construction shall be approved on a site
which has been undermined at shallow depths or in an area where
there is evidence of past subsidence unless the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed subdivision or land development
will be safe and will not create hazards for adjacent properties.
Evidence of safety shall be one of the following:
(a) If the site or any area of the site has been undermined and has
100 feet or less of overburden, evidence of the safety of the
proposed subdivision or land development shall require site
investigation and certification in writing by a professional
engineer, experienced in subsidence risk assessment, that the
proposed development will be safe.
(b) If the site has been undermined at a depth exceeding 100 feet
of overburden, a subsidence risk assessment by a professional
engineer and written certification that the proposed
subdivision or land development will be safe may be required if
the Township, the County, or the applicant has knowledge of
any past occurrences of subsidence in the general vicinity of
the site.
(3) Landslide-prone areas.
(a) Regulated as per Subsection D. Also:
(b) When a limited disturbance of unstable areas is requested by
an applicant, evidence of the safety of any proposed
disturbance shall require site investigation and certification in
writing by a registered soils engineer, engineering geologist,
or professional engineer with experience in soils engineering,
that the proposed activity will not create or exacerbate unsafe
conditions.
(4) Contaminated sites. Township Council shall not approve the
subdivision or development of land which is known to contain
substances which are classified as hazardous unless the site has
been made safe for the proposed development.
(a) A contaminated site shall be considered safe for subdivision or
development when a remediation plan has been completed and
approved by DEP, subject to the provisions of Subsection
I(4)(b) below.
(b) If a remediation plan includes limitations on uses, or other site
restrictions that would not apply to other property in the same
zoning district, these same limitations and/or restrictions must
be included with the proposed subdivision or land development
when it is considered for approval by the Township Council.
§ 310-61 CHARTER § 310-61
C:769
§ 310-62. Performance standards.
The following standards governing the operation of permitted activities in
any commercial, office, multifamily residential or industrial district shall
apply when they are more restrictive than applicable controls of Allegheny
County or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:
(c) The subdivision of contaminated land, not including any
development or earth disturbance, may be approved prior to
remediation if a notation approved by Township Council, after
advice from the Township Engineers, is placed on the recorded
plan, which indicates that the site or specified lots within the
site contain or may contain hazardous substances.
A. The developer shall produce evidence that the requirements of
Allegheny County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been or
will be met in the conduct of the proposed operation both during and
after development.
B. The following are maximum allowable emissions as measured along
property boundaries:

the shielded variety.
(4) Odors. Odors created by any manufacturing or processing
operation shall not be discernible beyond the property carrying on
a manufacturing or processing operation.
C. The following controls on potentially noxious side effects of industrial
operations shall also apply and the developer shall demonstrate to the
Township Council's satisfaction, that if activities likely to produce these
side effects will be a part of the operation, then measures will be taken
to conform to these controls:
(1) Dust. Shall be gathered within the structure housing the process
producing the dust.
(2) Radioactivity or electrical disturbance. No activities shall be
permitted which emit dangerous radioactivity or electrical
disturbance beyond the boundary of the property upon which such
disturbance originates.
(3) Outside storage.
(a) Solids. Solid materials shall be permanently screened from
view from any public street and from any adjacent residential
areas. This screening also applies to dumpsters.
(b) Liquids. Liquid materials shall be stored in vented tanks:

sewers, they shall be removed from the property producing
them and disposed of in a manner complying with state
regulations.
D. Industrial standards. The following standards shall apply to all
research, development and industrial construction or development,
whether new facilities, or expansion of existing operations, proposed
after the enactment of this chapter:
(1) The buffer yard areas are to be constructed and maintained
according to § 310-59E of this chapter. Plantings shall be
maintained at their natural height thereafter. The design of the
planted buffer yard shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by
a landscape architect or horticulturist paid by the developer. The
design shall consider topography and proposed and existing
vegetation, and shall be acted upon by the Township Council after
review and recommendation by the Environmental Advisory
Council.
(2) The operation is one listed as a permitted use or conditional use in
§ 310-40, Light Industrial District, § 310-41, Heavy Industrial

(3) The constituents of process stack emissions, such as particulates,
sulfur dioxide, noxious gases and volatile organic compounds, shall
be identified by the operator as to the chemical compounds and
mass emission rates (such as pounds per day, etc.). Further, such
emissions into the air shall be reduced to the lowest level attainable
by best available control technology, as defined in the comment
below. Such technology is to be proposed by the operator and
accepted by the Township after receiving advice from a mutually
agreed upon consultant. Emissions shall be subject to annual
testing by a qualified, independent consultant approved by the
Township and hired by the operator, who shall submit all test
results, broken down by chemical and mass emission rate, to the
Township. Further, when and if it is made known that there is a
hazardous air pollutant as defined in Section 112 of the Clean Air
Act, then, on a case-by-case basis, the operator will be required to
provide continuous monitoring on process stack emissions for the
hazardous pollutants. The Township shall be notified any time that
the normal emission rate is exceeded by more than 25% for three
consecutive on shifts.
Comment: "Best available control technology" is an emission
limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each
process stack emission constituents, which the mutually agreed
upon consultant determines on a case-by-case basis to be
achievable, taking into account environmental and economic
impacts and other costs. The best available control technology
so determined may be more stringent, but not less stringent,
in terms of emission reduction required, than the determination
of best available control technology for the same process stack
emission accepted by the Allegheny County Health Department
in its administration as set forth in Article 20 of the Rules and
Regulations of the Allegheny County Health Department with air
pollution control.
(4) The proposed plan of the development of the property as indicated
by the location, height and bulk of the building or buildings and
signs, the arrangement of vehicular entrances and interior road
network, the layout of the parking lots and truck servicing areas,
the site grading, landscaping and tree planting, and the existing
development of adjacent properties are shown on a rendered
architectural drawing which also specifies the proposed exterior
materials of the building or buildings.
(5) Access to the property is directly from an arterial road, except for
an optional controlled exit to a second road for emergency use only.
(6) No materials, either solid or liquid, used in or produced by the
assembly or limited manufacturing operation, including waste or
§ 310-62 CHARTER § 310-62
C:773
§ 310-63. Nonresidential development site plan review.
residual products, are stored outside the building or buildings,
except on a temporary basis, except that nitrogen may be stored
outside in closed containers located so as to be out of view by
observers on adjacent properties or streets and secured as
required by the Department of Labor and Industry, the Department
of Environment Protection and the Occupational Safety and Health
Act regulations.
(7) Lighting to illuminate parking lots, signs and/or buildings is
directed downward from the source and away from adjacent streets
and residential properties, or a sign may be internally or
backlighted, provided no light source is more than 30 feet off the
ground directly below and the light intensity does not exceed those
parameters established in § 310-66H.
(8) All utility lines on the property are placed underground.
E. Performance standards procedure.
(1) Prior to construction and operation. Any application for a building
permit for construction in the Light Industrial District, the Office,
Research and Development District or the Heavy Industrial District
shall be accompanied by expert evidence with the cost borne by the
owner of the property, that the proposed use will be operated in
accordance with these performance standards. Such statements
shall describe in detail the proposed use and process relative to
compliance with this chapter and any change in the future to the
process, as described by the applicant or by a successor company,
shall be presented to the Township for approval to insure continued
compliance.
(2) Continued compliance. Continued compliance with performance
standards is required and continued compliance with these
performance standards shall be enforced by the Zoning Officer.
(3) Determination of violation. The Zoning Officer shall investigate any
purported violation of performance standards. If it is determined
that a violation exists, such violation shall be terminated as
provided in Subsection E(4) following.
(4) Termination of violation. All verified violations shall be terminated
within 30 days of the decision of the Zoning Officer and shall be
deemed a separate violation for each day following the thirty-day
period and subject to penalties as set forth in Article XX of this
chapter. Appeal from the Zoning Officer's decision shall be to the
Zoning Hearing Board.
A. Any developer or owner of property in any zoning district who proposes
to construct a new building or enlarge an existing building for any use
other than as a single-family dwelling shall provide the Planning
§ 310-62 HAMPTON CODE § 310-63
C:774
Commission 20 copies of the plans described in Subsection F. Where
an owner or developer proposes to enlarge or relocate parking areas,
access drives, signs or other permanent features in his plan, he shall
provide the Planning Commission with 20 copies of the plans and
supporting drawings sufficient to illustrate his proposal. No zoning
permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for any use upon any lot
except a single-family dwelling until a site development plan has been
submitted, reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions
established in this chapter and Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land
Development; providing, however, that the existing structures where
the occupancy is being changed without any change in use category or
new construction or addition to structure and without change in site are
exempt from this requirement.
(1) Where a property owner desires to improve the facade of the
building aesthetically, and such improvement shall not constitute
an enlargement of the building, no additional site plan review shall
be required, provided:
(a) The improvement does not reduce or eliminate parking spaces.
(b) The area located within the improvement is not and may not be
used for any activity or purpose.
(c) Such improvement does not interfere with any fire lanes,
access drives or traffic patterns or violate any activities in
Subsection F(2)(b)[3], [7] and [9].
(d) The improvement does not violate any setback or height
requirements and in general complies with all ordinances
relative to any such structure.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all required permits must be
applied for.
(2) Revised site plans shall not be required to be submitted when a
property owner wishes to construct an accessory structure or to
construct an addition to a previously approved primary structure in
any of the zoning districts referenced in Subsection A which is less
than 1,000 square feet not affecting any parking spaces or access
aisles or other permanent features on the site and which structures
are not placed on or within 10 feet of any rights-of-way, easements
or parking areas. Placement of any such structures shall be in
conformity with all applicable Township regulations (i.e., setback
requirements, height limitations, permits, etc.). Multiple accessory
structures, or additions to previously approved primary or
accessory structures that meet or exceed the 1,000 square foot
limit, shall require a revised site plan.
B. Shared access lane. Any developer or owner of property in any
commercial, office research and development, or industrial district who
proposes to construct a new building or enlarge an existing building, or
§ 310-63 CHARTER § 310-63
C:775
any developers or owners of property situate in a commercial, office
research and development, or industrial district who desire to use a
common entrance from a public street for purposes of ingress, egress
and regress may, upon the submission of an appropriate site plan, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and of Chapter 280,
Subdivision and Land Development, obtain such approval, provided
that such shared access driveway shall:
(1) Extend in length no further than 800 feet;
(2) Be no less than 35 feet in width containing a paved cart way of no
less than 24 feet in width;
(3) Shall not allow parking spaces within 10 feet of the paved cart way;
(4) Shall record the appropriate irrevocable right-of-way agreement in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Allegheny County; and
(5) Meet all of the provisions of this chapter and of Chapter 280,
Subdivision and Land Development, that are not in conflict with the
provisions of this section.
C. Change of principal permitted use.
(1) When a property containing a single permitted use changes use or
is abandoned for a period of one year and the property is located in
one of the districts identified in Subsection A, the developer or
property owner shall file a site plan meeting the requirements
contained in Subsection F(2) unless the use is referred to in
§ 310-119B and is similar in nature to the previous use. The site
plan shall be forwarded directly to the Township Council at least 10
days prior to their agenda meeting for its review and possible
approval at their next scheduled regular meeting. If the new
proposed use has parking requirements different than the previous
use and requires the creation of additional parking spaces or areas,
then a revised site plan shall be required.
(2) If the existing condition of the site does not conform with any
provisions of this chapter, where appropriate, the Township Council
may require the developer or property owner to construct or install
improvements to the site in order to bring it into compliance with
the current standards of this chapter, i.e., adding landscaping and
buffer yards.
(3) This process shall only apply in situations when the primary use of
the site is changing and does not apply to sites with multiple uses,
i.e., a strip mall. The enlargement, modification or alteration of any
permanent features on the site shall require the developer or
owner to follow the review procedures outlined in Subsection E.
D. If a developer or owner proposes a use listed as a conditional use in
§§ 310-37C, 310-38C, 310-39C, 310-40C, 310-41C, and 310-42C of this
§ 310-63 HAMPTON CODE § 310-63
C:776
chapter, he shall first or simultaneously receive approval of his proposal
under the requirements of Article XII before proceeding to satisfy the
requirements of this section.
(1) In the event that a variance from the requirements of this chapter
is also requested by the developer, it must be approved by the
Zoning Hearing Board before a favorable decision on the site plan
is made by Township Council. Such request for a variance shall be
accompanied by a copy of a written request for an extension of time
submitted to Council for an extension of time for action on the site
plan application. If the developer fails to agree to the extension of
time, the Township Council shall act on the application as though
no variance has been granted.
(2) The Planning Commission and Environmental Advisory Council
should review the site plan while a variance request is being
reviewed by the Zoning Hearing Board and may recommend
approval, rejection, or approval with conditions before a decision is
reached by the Zoning Hearing Board.
E. Procedure for consideration and approval.
(1) The developer or owner shall submit the required plans to the
Township at least 10 working days prior to the regular meeting of
the Township Council, for referral by Township Council at their
next regular meeting to the Planning Commission and
Environmental Advisory Council.
(2) At their next regularly scheduled meetings following referral, the
Planning Commission and Environmental Advisory Council shall
review the plans as to conformity with this chapter; the physical
arrangement and appearance of the structures on the property;
vehicular access and circulation into and within the property;
parking layout; pedestrian walks; likely congestion or other
dangerous conditions that may be created by the proposed
development in adjacent roads; storm drainage systems, signs,
outdoor lighting, landscaping and other features of the proposal
that may be pertinent to the public health and safety. The developer
or owner or their representative is urged to attend these meetings.
(3) The Planning Commission and Environmental Advisory Council
may recommend to: approve; approve with conditions; or reject the
proposal as presented. The developer or owner may make revisions
as suggested by the Planning Commission and/or Environmental
Advisory Council and resubmit plans to the Planning Commission
and the Environmental Advisory Council. The Environmental
Advisory Council may also assign a Tracker to assist in monitoring
the project for compliance with the projects approved development
and landscaping plans. The Tracker, if any, shall report his or her
findings directly to the Zoning Officer.
§ 310-63 CHARTER § 310-63
C:777
(4) Immediately after the Planning Commission and Environmental
Advisory Council have made their recommendations and after the
developer or owner proposes no further revisions, the plans shall
be submitted to the Township Council, which shall review them at
its next regular meeting along with the Planning Commission's and
Environmental Advisory Council's recommendations. The Township
Council shall approve or reject the plan, or they may approve it
with conditions, which shall be attached to any permit issued for
any construction on the property.
(5) After final approval by the Township Council, no changes shall be
made in a plan unless the changes are first reviewed by the
Planning Commission and the Environmental Advisory Council, and
then approved by the Township Council. A change in scheduling or
sequence in the development of a plan to be carried out over a time
period and approved on this basis shall require review and
approval as for any other change.
(6) Separate building permits shall be required for each structure to be
erected as part of an approved group of structures on a site
regardless of the proposed timing of the construction of each. Site
development work, including but not limited to paving, storm
drainage structures and landscaping, shall be included as part of
the work covered under the building permit and subject to the
same completion requirements as for the structure.
(7) In addition to meeting all buffer yard requirements, at least 10% of
any property to be developed shall be landscaped per
recommendation of the Environmental Advisory Council and
approval by the Township Council. Not less than 5% of the total
property area shall be landscaping in that portion lying between
the principal structure on the property and the abutting street
right-of-way. Landscaping shall be primarily vegetation and should
provide a combination of several components such as grassed
areas, shrubbery, trees, ground cover, boulders or other features
and shall be mulched and maintained. Submitted drawings shall
clearly show all landscaping elements by type and location.
(8) To the extent possible, parking and truck loading areas shall be
arranged to be hidden from view from adjacent residential areas, or
screened from view by use of appropriate landscaping materials,
fencing or earth mounding, or any combination of these. Parking
and loading areas must meet the provisions established in
§§ 310-59E, 310-65H and 310-79G.
(9) Once the plan is approved, the development must occur within 24
months, unless an extension is requested in writing, and approved
by Township Council. If not, the site plan approved is void, and a
new plan must be submitted for review.

may waive the requirement for an Environmental Impact Statement
after review of the Environmental Advisory Council, if an applicant
§ 310-64 HAMPTON CODE § 310-64
C:782
§ 310-65. Landscaping.
The standards contained in this section are intended to promote public
health, safety, and welfare by filtering noise, softening or diverting light
and glare, modifying climatic conditions such as wind and heat, reducing
stormwater runoff and air pollution, and controlling traffic hazards. The
standards are also intended to increase the value to the community from
new developments by recognizing the role that landscaping plays in overall
community appearance and livability. In general, all areas of a site proposed
for development shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, ground covers,
grasses, and other herbaceous plants, except for those areas which are
occupied by buildings, roads, parking lots or other structures, or those
areas left in their natural state. Landscaping shall be provided for all uses
and development in all zoning districts in accordance with the following:
requests said waiver in writing, and further, provided said development
meets all standards of this chapter, will be served by both public water
and sewer systems, does not involve the relocation, improvement or
alterations of any watercourse, and no portion of the site is located
within a flood hazard or flood-prone or slide-prone area as designated
by the United States Geological Survey.
D. Waiver of requirements. Provided the site plan application is in
conformance with all other applicable municipal ordinances, that the
applicant has requested such in writing, and the Planning Commission
or Environmental Advisory Council has reviewed the request, the
Township Council may waive, alter, or reduce any requirement or
standard of this section under the following circumstances:
(1) Suitable alternative. Whenever a proposal presents an alternative
which conforms to the spirit and intention of this chapter.
(2) Unusual site characteristics. Whenever a physical feature may exist
on or adjacent to the site, which prevents a literal conformance to
requirements or standards.
A. Planting required in buffer yards as outlined in § 310-59E cannot be
substituted for any required planting mandated for this section.
However, any existing healthy shade trees which are not disturbed and
are not located within a required buffer yard and are a minimum of two
inches DBH shall count towards the required number of trees to be
planted outside of the buffer yard.
B. A landscaping plan, with detailed drawings, must be submitted and
must contain and present the following information:
(1) All required buffer yards with proposed plantings (identifying
ground cover and each proposed tree or bush) drawn to scale and
identifying the height and width of any proposed mounds.
(2) All required plantings, independent of any buffer yard
requirements (identifying ground cover and each tree, shrub, the
§ 310-64 CHARTER § 310-65
C:783
use of sod or seeding, etc., and known to prosper in this area)
drawn to scale.
(3) Any planting in excess of the requirements in § 310-59E and this
section.
(4) Any existing trees or vegetation which are to be preserved,
accurately identifying their relative location, approximate size and
name.
(5) Any existing trees or vegetation which will be removed, accurately
identifying their relative location.
C. At least one deciduous shade tree must be planted for each 1,000
square feet of net floor area in conjunction with any nonresidential
development unless as provided in Subsection G. Street trees, if
required, may be counted toward this requirement, but interior parking
lot trees shall not be counted.
D. At least one deciduous shade tree must be planted for each dwelling
unit in conjunction with any multifamily development. Street trees may
be counted toward this requirement.
E. All trees which are required to be planted as per the regulations of this
section shall be minimum of two-and-one-half-inch caliper at the time of
planting and shall be planted in accordance with accepted conservation
practices. They shall be spaced with regard to the ultimate spread of
the fully developed canopy, but with the following maximum spacing
requirements:
(1) For trees with an ultimate height of 25 feet or more, a maximum
distance not to exceed 50 feet.
(2) For trees with an ultimate height of less than 25 feet, a maximum
distance of 25 feet on center.
F. In conjunction with the development of property for any use, the
applicant must show that the removal of any trees or natural vegetation
is necessary for the imminent and orderly development of the property.
"Imminent development" is defined in Article IV.
G. Street trees. All new nonresidential developments may provide street
trees, in accordance with the following standards, and all new
residential developments, at the developer's discretion, may provide
street trees in accordance with the following standards:
(1) Street trees, if required or provided, shall be provided along the
entire length of the street right-of-way and on both sides of the
street if the street lies within the development.
(2) All street trees shall be located between 10 feet to 15 feet off of the
street right-of-way.
§ 310-65 HAMPTON CODE § 310-65
C:784
(3) Street trees shall be located to enable the maintenance of utilities,
required sight distances, and visibility of street and traffic signs.
(4) The species chosen shall provide shade and shall be appropriate to
the location. Factors such as microclimate, soils, habit of growth,
salt and disease tolerance, proximity of sidewalks, overhead utility
lines, and social condition (likelihood of soil compaction, damage
from air pollution, dogs, deer, etc.) shall be considered.
(5) Any new street and/or parking lot trees in nonresidential areas
shall be protected by tree grates and/or permanent fencing if
suitable protected areas have not been provided.
(6) Mature trees, woodlands, or other high-quality existing vegetation
which remains undisturbed adjacent to the street right-of-way may
be used in the place of, or in conjunction with, the requirements of
this section.
H. Landscaping of parking lots. Landscaping in the interior of parking
areas shall be designed to provide visual and climatic relief from large
expanses of paving, and to channelize and define areas for safe
pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
(1) A minimum of 5% of the total area of any parking lot containing 30
spaces or less shall be landscaped, and at least 7% of the total area
of any parking lot containing more than 30 parking spaces shall be
landscaped. For this requirement, the "total area of any parking
lot" includes all parking spaces, lanes, roads or aisles for motorized
vehicular traffic.
(2) Groupings of at least one large (ultimate height exceeding 40 feet)
shade tree and three shrubs, or one medium (ultimate height 25
feet to 40 feet) shade tree, one small (ultimate height not exceeding
25 feet) tree, and three shrubs shall be planted for every 10
parking spaces and shall be disbursed throughout the interior of
the parking lot. In order to insure the survival of the plant material,
the minimum planting area for either grouping will be 110 square
feet.
(3) The caliper of all new trees shall be as in Subsection E.
(4) Trees required in this section shall be planted in protected areas
such as along walkways, or within curbed islands located between
rows of parking spaces, at the ends of bays, or between parking
stalls. Both the overall plan and the species to be planted must be
reviewed by the Environmental Advisory Council. This is not meant
to prohibit some other innovative landscaping plan, especially for
small parking lots, but any plan must be deemed to be at least
equivalent to the above scheme.
(5) Curbed landscaping islands shall have a minimum width of nine
feet, including curbing.
§ 310-65 CHARTER § 310-65
C:785
§ 310-66. Additional bulk and area requirements.

outdoor lighting standards listed below apply to all new multifamily
residential, nonresidential developments and to replacement
fixtures in all zoning districts. Township Council may grant
exceptions to the shielding requirements, maximum level of
illumination, and height of outdoor light fixtures for outdoor
recreation facilities on park sites with the finding that the light
impacts do not create a public nuisance for abutting residential
property.
(a) Shielding required. Except as otherwise exempt, all outdoor
lighting shall be constructed with full shielding. Where the
light source from an outdoor light fixture is visible beyond the
property line, and exceeds the established footcandle limit,
shielding shall be required to reduce glare so that the light
source is not visible from within any residential dwelling unit.
§ 310-66 HAMPTON CODE § 310-66
C:788
Outdoor lighting for single-family residential use shall be
located and/or shielded in a manner to ensure that the
intensity and direction of exterior and security lighting does
not constitute a public nuisance to abutting residential
dwellings. See Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1
(b) Level of illumination. During hours of darkness, the minimum
and average maintained footcandles of light shall be consistent
with the provisions listed below. A point-by-point photometric
calculation listing the number, type, height, and level of
illumination of all outdoor lighting fixtures shall be required in
conjunction with the development permit application and prior
to issuance of a building permit or site improvement plans to
ensure compliance with these provisions.
[1] Parking lots, driveways, trash enclosures/areas, public
phones, and group mailboxes shall be illuminated with a
minimum maintained one footcandle of light and an
average not to exceed four footcandles of light. Also see
§ 310-79G(7).
[2] Pedestrian walkways shall be illuminated with a minimum
maintained one-half footcandle of light and average not to
exceed two footcandles of light.
[3] Exterior door of nonresidential structures shall be
illuminated during the hours of darkness, with a minimum
maintained one footcandle of light, measured within a fivefoot
radius on each side of the door at ground level.
[4] In order to minimize light trespass on abutting residential
property, illumination measured at the nearest residential
structure or rear yard setback line shall not exceed the
§ 310-66 CHARTER § 310-66
C:789
moon's potential ambient illumination of one-tenth
footcandle.
(c) Maximum height of freestanding outdoor light fixtures. The
maximum height of freestanding outdoor light fixtures for
development abutting residential property shall be 20 feet.
However, the Planning Commission may recommend
exceptions to this height restriction in conjunction with design
review if the proposed lighting plan has negligible light glare
and spill impacts on adjoining residential properties.
Otherwise, the maximum height for freestanding outdoor light
fixtures for nonresidential properties shall be 30 feet.
(d) Type of illumination. All new outdoor lighting fixtures shall be
energy efficient with a rated average bulb life not less than
10,000 hours and shall be of the shielded variety.
(e) Hours of illumination. Automatic timing devices shall be
required for all new outdoor light fixtures with off hours
(exterior lights turned off) between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
However, outdoor lights may remain on during business hours
of operation for security purposes (e.g., to illuminate
walkways, roadways, equipment yards, and parking lots).
Outdoor lights may also remain on to illuminate flags
representing a country, state or other civic entity.
(f) Outdoor sports field/outdoor performance area lighting.
[1] The mounting height of outdoor sports field and outdoor
performance area lighting fixtures shall be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis by the Planning Commission.
[2] All outdoor sports field and outdoor performance area
lighting fixtures shall be equipped with glare control
package (louvers, shields, or similar devices).
[3] The fixtures must be aimed so that their beams are
directed and fall within the primary playing or
performance area.
[4] The hours of operation for the lighting system for any
game or event shall not exceed one hour after the end of
the event.
§ 310-66 HAMPTON CODE § 310-66
C:790
(g) Architectural/landscape lighting. Outdoor light fixtures used to
illuminate architectural and landscape features shall use a
narrow cone of light for the purpose of confining the light to
the object.
(h) Sign lighting. The artificial illumination of signs, both from an
internal or external source, shall be designed to eliminate
negative impacts on surrounding rights-of-way and properties.
(i) Canopy lighting. Lighting associated with a canopy used for
vehicular shelters, including gas stations and car washes:
[1] Canopy lights, such as service station lighting, shall be
fully recessed or fully shielded so as to ensure that no light
source is visible from, or causes glare on, public rights-ofway
or adjacent properties.
[2] Lighting installed beneath a canopy shall be pointed
downward and substantially confined to the ground
surface directly beneath the perimeter of the canopy.
[3] Lighting beyond the perimeter of the canopy shall be
consistent with the lighting ordinance for parking areas.
(2) Lighting prohibited. Existing light fixtures legally permitted,
authorized prior to adoption of this chapter, may be maintained, but

effective date of this chapter must be in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. Any lighting legally in existence
before the effective date of this chapter that does not comply
with its requirements must come into compliance upon the
occurrence of any of the following events. Any lighting illegally
in existence before the effective date of this chapter must come
into compliance immediately upon adoption of this chapter.
[1] Alterations to existing lighting.
[a] When poles and support structures are removed and
replaced for reasons other than acts of God or
accidents, they must be replaced with luminaries,
poles and supports that comply with this section; and
§ 310-66 HAMPTON CODE § 310-66
C:792
[b] When luminaries are replaced without replacement of
poles or support structure, they must be replaced with
luminaries that comply with all provisions of this
section. In no event, however, may the existing light
intensity levels be reduced below existing lighting
levels for the parking area. Routine maintenance,
including changing the lamp ballast, starter, photo
control, lens, and other required components, is
permitted for all existing fixtures. When a fixture
housing is changed, the fixture must come into

period of one year, the lighting must be upgraded to fully
comply with this section prior to any reoccupation of the
site.
[6] Conditions of approval. When a development application is
made for a site, the Township Council may as a condition of
approval require compliance with any or all of the
performance standards of this section, and the extent of
compliance required in such cases may be greater than
that otherwise required, if deemed reasonably necessary
to protect the public health, safety or welfare and to

requirements and the Township ordinance requirements, the Township
requirements shall prevail:
(1) Hive type. No beekeeper shall keep or maintain bees in any hive
other than a modern movable frame hive which permits thorough
examination of every comb to determine the presence of bee
disease.
(2) Maximum number of colonies. For a property with a minimum of
20,000 square feet of lot area, a beekeeper is permitted to maintain
not more than four hives. For each additional 10,000 square feet of
lot area, the beekeeper is permitted one additional hive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that all hives are situated
at least 200 feet in any direction from all property lines of the lot on
which the apiary is situated, or provided that all adjoining property
that falls within a two-hundred-foot radius of any hive is
undeveloped property, or in areas zoned agricultural, or if the hives
are being used for crop pollination, there will be no per se limit on
the number of hives on one's property.
(3) Location of hives. Beekeeping facilities shall meet the primary
structure setback requirement from any lot line.
(4) Location of beekeeping facilities. Beekeeping facilities shall not be
located within 50 feet of a swimming pool or permanently kenneled
animal at the time of initial establishment.

minimum lot area of at least five acres, beekeeping facilities are
prohibited from and shall not be located in the front yard of any
property as defined by the Zoning Ordinance.
(6) Hive orientation and flyaway barriers. Hive entrances shall face
away from neighboring property and in such a direction that bees
fly across the beekeeper's property at sufficient distance to gain a
height of at least six feet at the property line. The use of barriers
may be employed to redirect the bees' flight pathway and establish
§ 310-75.1 HAMPTON CODE § 310-75.1
C:808
bee flight pathways above six feet. Should the flight path not be
able to be obtained as described above, then a flyway barrier, at
least four feet in height, shall be placed along the side of the hive(s)
that contain the entrance to the hive(s), shall be located within five
feet of the hive(s), and shall extend at least two feet on either side
of the hive(s). A flyway barrier shall consist of a fence, vegetation,
hedge, or combination thereof, that provides for suitable flight path
of bees as described above. No flyway barrier is required for hive(s)
that are located on porches or balconies at least 10 feet above
grade.
(7) Beekeeping facilities shall erect signs as necessary, but no larger
than one foot by one foot, to warn persons of the presence of bees.
(8) All hive areas shall, at a minimum, be surrounded by a three-foothigh
fence to prevent unauthorized access.
(9) Water. From April 1 through November 1 of each year, all
beekeepers in the Township shall ensure that a convenient source
of fresh water is available to the bees which is located closer to the
apiary than any other water source.
(10) Maintenance. All beekeepers shall ensure that no bee comb or
other materials are left upon the ground of the apiary site. Upon
removal from the apiary, all such material shall promptly be
disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or
other bee-proof enclosure.
(11) Best management practices. All beekeepers owning or maintaining
an apiary in the Township shall practice such best management
practices as adopted or recommended by the Department. (In the
event of a conflict or inconsistency between the BMP agreement or
other Department requirements, and any more strict Township
ordinance requirements, the Township requirements shall prevail.)
(12) Nuisances prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any beekeeper to
keep any hive in such a manner as to cause any unhealthy
condition, interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of human or
animal life, or interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of the
properties surrounding the beekeeper's property. By way of
example and not limitation, the following activities are hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and are, therefore, unlawful:
(a) Multiple bees stinging, attacking, or otherwise molesting
others, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle
passengers, or domestic animals;
(b) The keeping of bees not in compliance with these Zoning
provisions;
(c) The keeping of bees which interferes with the freedom of
movement of persons in a public right-of-way;
§ 310-75.1 CHARTER § 310-75.1
C:809
(d) The keeping of overcrowded, bee diseased, or abandoned
hives;
(e) Beekeeping facilities shall be managed in such a manner as to
minimize the potential occurrence of bees entering streets,
sidewalks, or unauthorized properties; and
(f) Beekeeping facilities shall at all times be in compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations.

WCF and the scheduling of the public hearing
upon the application, the applicant shall mail notice to
all owners of every property within 500 feet of the
proposed facility. The applicant shall provide proof of
the notification to the Township.
[c] Conditional use authorization required. Tower-based
WCFs are permitted in certain zoning districts and
along certain public rights-of-way by conditional use
and only in such location within such districts, and
along such rights-of-way, and at a height necessary to
satisfy their function in the applicant's wireless
communications system. No applicant shall have the
right under these regulations to erect a tower to the
maximum height specified in this section unless it
proves the necessity for such height. The applicant
shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF
is the minimum height necessary for the service area.
[i] Prior to Council's approval of a conditional use
authorizing the construction and installation of
tower-based WCF in a zoning district where the
same is a permitted conditional use, it shall be
incumbent upon the applicant for such conditional
use approval to prove to the reasonable
satisfaction of Council that the applicant cannot
adequately extend or infill its communications
system by the use of equipment such antennae
installed on existing structures, such as utility
poles or their appurtenances and other available
tall structures. The applicant shall further
demonstrate that the proposed WCF must be
located where it is proposed in order to serve the
applicant's service area and that no other viable
alternative location exists.
[ii] The conditional use application shall be
accompanied by a propagation study evidencing
the need for the proposed tower or other
communication facilities and equipment.
[iii] The conditional use application shall be
accompanied by documentation demonstrating
that the proposed tower-based WCF complies

of a permit authorizing construction and erection of a
tower-based WCF, a structural engineer registered in
Pennsylvania shall issue to the Township a written
certification of the proposed WCF's ability to meet the
structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication
Industry Association and certify the proper
construction of the foundation and the erection of the
structure.
[e] Visual appearance. Tower-based WCFs shall employ
stealth technology which may include the tower
portion to be painted silver or another color approved
by Council, or shall have a galvanized finish. All
wireless communications equipment buildings and
other accessory facilities shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the surrounding
environment and shall maximize the use of a like
facade to blend with the existing surroundings and
neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible.
[i] Township Council shall reserve the right to
require that:
[A] Commercial communications antenna
support structures be painted to match their
surroundings (i.e., painted green up to the
treeline); and
[B] Wireless communications equipment be
placed underground, unless determined to be
detrimental to the functioning and physical
integrity of such equipment.
[ii] In making these determinations, Council shall
consider whether its decision will promote the
harmonious and orderly development of the
zoning district involved; encourage compatibility
with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring
properties by preventing a negative impact on the
aesthetic character of the community; preserve
woodlands and trees existing at the site to the
greatest possible extent; and encourage sound
engineering and land development design and
construction principles, practices and techniques.

[f] Co-location and siting. An application for a new towerbased
WCF shall not be approved unless the Township
finds that the wireless communications equipment
planned for the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved structure
or building, or on Township property. Council may
deny an application to construct a new tower-based
WCF if the applicant has not made a good faith effort
to mount the commercial communications antenna(s)
on an existing structure as set forth in this section.
The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the
owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within
a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures,
buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the
following reasons:
[i] The proposed antenna and related equipment
would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing building, structure or tower, and its
reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
[ii] The proposed antenna and related equipment
would cause radio frequency interference with
other existing equipment for that existing
building, structure, or tower, and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
[iii] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do
not have adequate location, space, access, or
height to accommodate the proposed equipment
or to allow it to perform its intended function.

the Chairman of the Board shall designate as many alternate
members of the Board to sit on the Board as may be needed to
provide a quorum. Any alternate member of the Board shall
continue to serve on the Board in all proceedings involving the
matter or case for which the alternate was initially appointed until
the Board has made a final determination of the matter or case.
Designation of an alternate pursuant to this section shall be made
on a case-by-case basis in rotation according to declining seniority
among all alternatives.

procedure consistent with this and other ordinances of Hampton
Township and the laws of the commonwealth.

§ 310-94 HAMPTON CODE § 310-95
C:918
45 days of the prior hearing, and all hearings shall be completed
within 100 days after the applicant completes its case in chief unless
extended by application to the Court of Common Pleas. Two notices
shall be placed in the classified section of a newspaper of general local
circulation once in each of two consecutive weeks, the first publication
appearing not more than 30 days and the second publication not less
than seven days prior to the hearing. In addition, written notice of said
hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land at
least one week prior to the hearing. Notices shall indicate the date,
time, and place of the hearing and the particular nature of the matter
to be considered, as well as the street address of the specific property
involved. All property owners within 300 feet of the property involved
shall be notified by letter at least seven days before the hearing.
B. The parties to the hearing shall be the applicant, the municipality, any
person affected by the application who has made timely appearance of
record before the Board, and any other person, including civic or
community organizations, permitted to appear by the Board. The Board
shall require all persons who wish to be considered parties to enter an
appearance and all those parties giving testimony or presenting
evidence shall be sworn in.
C. The Chairman of the Board, or the Hearing Officer, shall conduct the
hearing and shall have the power to administer oaths and issue
subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses and/or the production of
documents and papers, including witnesses and documents requested
by the parties. The parties in a hearing shall have the right to be
represented by counsel and shall be afforded the opportunity to
respond, present evidence and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all
relevant issues. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant
or redundant evidence may be excluded.
D. The Board, or the Hearing Officer (if he is conducting the hearings),
shall keep a stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance
fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the
Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board if
the transcript is ordered by the Board or the Hearing Officer, or shall be
paid by the person appealing from the decision of the Board if such an
appeal is made, and in either event, the cost of additional copies shall
be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases,
the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
The Board, or the Hearing Officer, shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party, and/or representatives of any party in
connection with any issue relevant to the hearing, except upon notice
and opportunity for all parties to participate; shall not take notice of any
communications, reports or other materials, except advice from the
Board legal counsel, unless all parties are afforded an opportunity to
contest the material so noticed; and shall not inspect any site or its
surroundings with any party and/or representative of any party after
§ 310-95 CHARTER § 310-95
C:919
the start of hearings unless all parties are given an opportunity to be
present.
E. The Board, or Hearing Officer, shall render a written decision, or, when
no decision is required, a written finding on the application within 45
days after the conclusions of the hearing before the Board or Hearing
Officer. Decisions shall be based on findings of fact and conclusions
based on them, together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based
on any provisions of this chapter or any other ordinance or regulation of

and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light
of the facts. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with Section
908 of the Municipalities Planning Code.180

make the Hearing Officer's report and recommendations available to
the parties within 45 days and the parties shall be entitled to make
written representations thereon to the Board prior to final decision or
entry of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later than
30 days after the report of the Hearing Officer. Where the Board fails to
render the decision within the period required by this subsection, or
fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days from the date of the
applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed
in writing or, on the record, to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the
Board to meet or render a decision as herein above provided, the Board
shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day
it could have to render a decision in the same as provided in Subsection
E of this section.
G. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
H. A developer whose project has been approved, at either the preliminary
or final level, but who is forced to suspend the project as the result of an
appeal brought by a third party, may petition the Court to require the
appealing party to post a bond as a condition of continuing the appeal,
the amount to be determined by the Court. The Court shall hear the
petition, determine whether the appeal is frivolous, and if so, may
require the posting of the bond. Any appeals to the decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board shall be conducted in accordance with the
appeals procedure set out in the Municipalities Planning Code.181

§ 310-96. Mediation option.
I. A copy of the final decision, or the findings, if no decision is required,
shall be mailed to the applicant not later than the day after the date of
the decision. All others requesting notice of the decision not later than
the last day of the hearing shall receive by mail a summary of the
findings or decision and a statement of the place at which the full
decision or findings may be examined.
A. Parties to proceedings authorized in this article may utilize mediation
as an aid in completing such proceedings. In proceedings before the
Zoning Hearing Board, in no case shall the Zoning Hearing Board
initiate mediation or participate as a mediating party. Mediation shall
supplement, not replace, those procedures in this article once they have
been formally initiated. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
expanding or limiting municipal police powers or as modifying any
principles of substantive law.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the particulars of
each case and the willingness of the parties to negotiate. The Township
of Hampton assures that in each case, the mediating parties, assisted
by the mediator as appropriate, will develop terms and conditions for:
(1) Funding mediation.
(2) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a working
knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision procedures and
demonstrated skills in mediation.
(3) Completing mediation, including time limits for such completion.
(4) Suspending time limits otherwise authorized, provided there is
written consent by the mediating parties, and by an applicant or
municipal decision-making body, if either is not a party to the
mediation.
(5) Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity to
participate.
(6) Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or all of the
mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.
(7) Assuring that mediated solutions are in writing and signed by the
parties, and become subject to review, and approval by the
appropriate decision-making body pursuant to the authorized
procedures set forth in the Municipalities Planning Code.
C. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding the
final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as evidence in
any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.

render final adjudication in the following matters:
182. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1 and 10909.1(a)(1), respectively.
183. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10909.1(a)(8).
§ 310-97 HAMPTON CODE § 310-97
C:922
§ 310-98. Functions of the Board.
(a) All applications for approval of planned residential

the provision of Section 909.1(b)(1) through (7) of the State
Municipalities Code.184
(b) All applications for subdivision and land development approval

(f) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or the
municipal engineer in the administration of any land use
ordinance or provisions thereof with reference to
sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater
management insofar as the same relate to application for land

Chapter 280, Subdivision and Land Development, as amended.
Where such determination relates only to development, not
involving Article IX, as amended, and the Chapter 280,
Subdivision and Land Development, as amended, application,
the appeal from such determination of the Zoning Officer or
the Municipal Engineer shall be to the Zoning Hearing Board
pursuant to Subsection A(9).
B. Applicability of judicial remedies. Nothing contained in this article shall
be construed to deny the appellant the right to proceed directly to court
where appropriate, pursuant to the procedures provided in the
Municipalities Code or any appropriate statute of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
A. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear request for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant.
184. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10909.1(b)(1) through (7).
§ 310-97 CHARTER § 310-98
C:923
(2) Variance from Board unless a written application for a variance is
submitted to the Secretary of the Board. The Board may grant a
variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including but not limited to, irregularity, narrowness or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical
or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located;
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(d) That, the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property or be
detrimental to the public welfare; and
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(3) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter.
B. Special exceptions.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions,
which are specified for the various zone districts, pursuant to
express standards and criteria in this chapter.
(2) If a special exception is granted, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, predicated upon the
developers submission of a written application to the Secretary of
the Board demonstrating that the development for which the
special exception is sought:
§ 310-98 HAMPTON CODE § 310-98
C:924
(a) Will not endanger the public health, safety and welfare if
located where proposed, and that the use will not deteriorate
the environment or generate nuisance conditions such as
traffic congestion, noise, dust, smoke, glare or vibration;
(b) Meets all other requirements of this chapter in the zoning
district where the use is proposed;
(c) Is in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan for the
Township of Hampton and in harmony with the area in which it
is proposed; and
(d) Is an appropriate use on the proposed site.
C. Validity of ordinance: substantive questions.
(1) A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof, which
prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest, shall submit the challenge either:
(a) To the Zoning Hearing Board under § 310-97A(1); or
(b) To the governing body under § 310-97A(10), together with a
request for a curative amendment under § 310-123.
(2) Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land
of another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who
desires to challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first
submit their challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision
thereon under § 310-97A(1).
(3) The submission referred to in Subsection C(1)(a) and (b) shall be
governed by the following:
(a) In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the
challenging party shall make a written request to the Board
that it hold a hearing on the challenge. The request shall
contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the landowner
desires to challenge the validity of such ordinance and elects to
proceed by curative amendment, under § 310-123, his/her
application to the governing body shall contain, in addition to
the requirements of the written request thereof, the plans and
explanatory materials describing the use or development
proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use or development
permitted by the challenged ordinance or map. Such plans or
other materials shall not be required to meet the standards
prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the
issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice
of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for
evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof.
§ 310-98 CHARTER § 310-98
C:925
Nothing herein contained shall preclude the landowner from
seeking a final approval before submitting his/her challenge.
(b) If the submission is made by the landowner to the governing
body under Subsection C(1), the request also shall be
accompanied by an amendment or amendments to the
ordinance proposed by the landowner to cure the alleged
defects therein.
(c) If the submission is made to the governing body, the municipal
solicitor shall represent and advise it at the hearing or
hearings referred to in § 310-123.
(d) The governing body may retain an independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its
behalf and to present their witnesses on its behalf.
(e) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or
hearings, the governing body or the Zoning Hearing Board, as
the case may be, shall determine whether the challenged
ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a
challenge heard by a governing body is found to have merit,
the governing body shall proceed as provided in § 310-123. If a
challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include
recommending amendments to the challenged ordinance,
which will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments, plans
and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall
also consider:
[1] The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities,
water supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
[2] If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the
effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of
a type actually available to, and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of the ordinance or map;
[3] The suitability of the site for the intensity of the use
proposed by the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands,
floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural
features;
[4] The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected
or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts; and
§ 310-98 HAMPTON CODE § 310-98
C:926
[5] The impact of the proposal on the preservation of
agriculture and other land uses which are essential to
public health, safety and welfare.
(f) The governing body or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case
may be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
(g) If the governing body or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case
may be, fails to act on the landowner's request within the time
limits referred to in Subsection C(3)(f), a denial of the request
is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of
the last hearing.
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be,
shall commence its hearing within 60 days after the request is filed,
unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
(5) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where
and the times when a copy of the request, including any plans,
explanatory material or proposed amendments may be examined
by the public.
(6) The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(a) The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body may, as the case
may be, fails to commence the hearing within the time limits
set forth in Subsection C(4);
(b) The governing body notifies landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment;
(c) The governing body adopts another curative amendment which
is unacceptable to the landowner; or
(d) The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may
be, fails to act on the request 45 days after the close of the last
hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual
consent by the landowner and municipality.
(7) Where a curative amendment proposal is by the governing body
pursuant to § 310-97A(10)(d), or a validity challenge is sustained by
the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to § 310-97A(1), or the Court
acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment
proposal or a validity challenge, and the proposal or challenge so
approved requires a further application for subdivision or land
development, the developer shall have two years from the date of
such approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative
approval pursuant to Article IX or Chapter 280, Subdivision and
Land Development. Within the two-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
§ 310-98 CHARTER § 310-98
C:927
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely
affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of
the preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of Chapter 280,
Subdivision and Land Development, and Article IX shall apply.
Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment
application or the validity challenge is approved but does not
require further application under any subdivision or land
development ordinance, the developer shall have one year within
which to file for a building permit. Within the one-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in
the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the Court shall retain or assume
jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such supplemental relief
as may be necessary.
(8) Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion. In order not to
unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that the ordinance or map under which he proposed to
build is free from challenge, and recognizing that the procedure for
preliminary approval of his/her development may be too
cumbersome or may be unavailable, the landowner may advance
the date from which time any challenge to the ordinance or map
will run under § 310-99B by the following procedure:
(a) The landowner may submit plans and other materials
describing his/her proposed use or development, to the Zoning
Officer for a preliminary opinion as to their compliance with
the applicable ordinances and maps. Such plans and other
materials shall not be required to meet the standards
prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the
issuance of a building permit so long as they provide
reasonable notice of the proposed use or development and a
sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
(b) If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice
thereof shall be published once each week for two successive
weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality. Such notice shall include a general description of
the proposed use or development and its location, by some
readily identifiable directive, and the place and times where
the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under § 310-99B and the
time therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the
Board shall run from the time when the second notice thereof
has been published.

person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
has succeeded to his/her interest after such approval, he/her shall
be bound by the knowledge of his/her predecessor in interest.
(2) The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision on a tentative plan pursuant to Article IX or from
an adverse decision by the Township Council on a challenge to the
validity or an ordinance or map, pursuant to § 310-98C(1)(b), shall
preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case where
the final submission substantially deviates from the approved
tentative approval.
(3) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowners within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
A. Upon the filing of an appeal, and while an appeal is pending before the
Board, any development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order
or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body and all
official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or the Court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition,
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.

ARTICLE XVI
Nonconforming Uses
§ 310-101. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to buildings, structures, signs, lots
and uses which became nonconforming as the result of the application of
this chapter to them or from classification or reclassification of the property
under this chapter or any subsequent amendments thereto.
§ 310-102. Nonconforming lots of record.
§ 310-103. Nonconforming uses of land.
A. Regardless of the size of a lot legally recorded prior to the passage of
this chapter, such lot may be developed for any use permitted in the
district in which the lot is located provided that it meets the
requirements of § 310-58.
B. If two or more contiguous lots of record in one ownership occur prior to
passage of this chapter and if one or all of these lots are less than the
requirements of lot width and area as established in this chapter, the
total contiguous area of all the lots shall be considered as undivided
and, unless consolidated into an adjoining lot to become part of a
conforming parcel, no portion of any such nonconforming lots shall be
used to calculate setback or bulk and area requirements for any
adjacent commonly owned lot. Nor shall any portion of any such
nonconforming lots be used for an accessory structure serving an
adjacent lot. Nor shall any primary structure be built on such
nonconforming lot unless such nonconforming lot(s) equals or exceeds

indicated:
ARRAY  Any number of electrically connected photovoltaic (PV) modules
providing a single electrical output.
BUILDING-INTEGRATED SYSTEM  A solar photovoltaic system that is
constructed as an integral part of a principal or accessory building or
structure and where the building-integrated system features maintain a
uniform profile or surface of vertical walls, window openings, and roofing.
Such a system is used in lieu of a separate mechanical device, replacing or
substituting for an architectural or structural component of the building or
structure that appends or interrupts the uniform surfaces of walls, window
openings and roofing. A building-integrated system may occur within
vertical facades, replacing view glass, spandrel glass or other facade
material; into semitransparent skylight systems; into roofing systems,
replacing traditional roofing materials; or other building or structure
envelope systems.
BUILDING-MOUNTED SYSTEM  A solar photovoltaic system attached to
any part or type of roof on a building or structure that has an occupancy
permit on file with the Township and that is either the principal structure
or an accessory structure on a recorded property. This system also includes
any solar-based architectural elements.
CELL  The smallest basic solar electric device which generates electricity
when exposed to light.
DRIP LINE  The outermost edge of a roof including eaves, overhangs and
gutters.
GROUND-MOUNTED SYSTEM  A solar photovoltaic system mounted on
a structure, pole or series of poles constructed specifically to support the
photovoltaic system and not attached to any other structure.
HVAC  Equipment used to heat, cool or ventilate a structure.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  A surface area that prevents or retards the
infiltration of water into the soil and/or a hard surface area that causes
water to run off the surface of the ground in greater quantities or at
an increased rate of flow from the conditions prior to development,
construction, building or installation.
INTERCONNECTION  The technical and practical link between the solar
generator and the grid providing electricity to the greater community.
KILOWATT (kW)  A unit of electrical power equal to 1,000 watts, which
constitutes the basic unit of electrical demand. A watt is a metric
