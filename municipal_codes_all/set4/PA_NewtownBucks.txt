such period of qualified military service, and the participant makes payment to the plan in an
amount equal to the participant contributions that would otherwise have been paid to the plan
during such period of qualified military service. The amount of participant contributions shall
be based upon an estimate of the compensation that would have been paid to the participant
during such period of qualified military service as determined by the average compensation
paid to the participant during the 12 months immediately preceding the period of qualified
military service. The amount of participant contributions calculated must be paid into the plan

be aggregated with this plan for purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(c), and

Maximum Benefit Limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, no benefit
provided under this plan attributable to contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual
amount, the amount specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to Code § 415(d),
assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The
limitations described in this subsection shall be governed by the following conditions and
definitions:
Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits)
or where the employee contributes to the plan or makes rollover contributions shall be
adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to
determine the limitation contained herein.
In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of age 62 by the participant,
the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to this section commencing at age 62; however, in the case of a
qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least 15 years of
service, including applicable military service, as a full-time employee of a police or fire
department is taken into account in determining the amount of benefit), the limitation
contained herein shall not apply.
In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age 65 by the participant, the
limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with
applicable regulations to the amount determined commencing at age 65.
Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer expressed as an annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed
the limitation of this section provided that the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated; however, in the case of a
participant who is not receiving a disability retirement benefit pursuant to § 105.2 or a survivor
benefit pursuant to §§ 106.2 or 106.3, with fewer than 10 years of participation the limitation
expressed in this subsection (d) shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of participation less
than 10 but in no event shall this limitation be less than $1,000.
The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for calculation purposes,
shall be applied to all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer as one defined benefit
plan and to all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined
contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted consistent with Code § 415 and
regulations thereunder as applicable to government plans in general and this Plan in
particular.
In the case of a survivor benefit under §§ 106.2 or 106.3 or a disability retirement benefit
under § 105.2, the adjustment under paragraph .B hereof shall not apply and the applicable
limitation shall be the limitation contained herein without regard to the age of the benefit
recipient.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit of any participant who
becomes entitled to benefits prior to death shall be distributed either:
Not later than the required beginning date.
Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning date and extending over
the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and a designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant,
or the joint life expectancies of such participant and a designated Beneficiary).

entire interest has been distributed after distribution of the benefits has begun in
accordance with subparagraph (2) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under
subparagraph (2) as of the date of the death.
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies before distribution of the benefit
has begun, the entire interest of such employee shall be distributed within five years of the
death of such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of the
employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary, such portion
shall be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than
one year after the date of the employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in the
preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on
the date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant,
then the date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the date
upon which the employee would have attained age 70 1/2 and, further provided, if the
surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph shall
be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
For purposes, of this section, the following definitions and procedures shall apply:
Required Beginning Date. April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar

"Eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life or (life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated
beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution
that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section of the plan, a portion of the
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income.
However, such portion may only be paid to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in § 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan
described in §§ 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for
amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion which is not includible.
"Eligible retirement plan is a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), an individual
retirement account described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code § 403(a), an annuity
contract described in Code § 403(b), an eligible deferred compensation plan described in
Code § 457(b), which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, and any
agency or instrumentality of a state or a political subdivision of a state and which agrees
to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan.
"Distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or
former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in Code § 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
"Direct rollover" is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee or the plan administrator, if the distributee does not make an election.
Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process and shall be payable only to the participant or
designated beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the subject of a
domestic relations order, mandated by court of competent jurisdiction, that clearly provides for
proper distribution of a portion of the pension benefit payments to an alternate payee (former
spouse of the participant) and does not require any benefit to be paid in excess of the available
benefit earned and accrued under the plan.
Retired Participants. Any participant who shall have retired prior to the restatement date shall not
have the benefit altered in any way by the provisions of this amended and restated plan, except
where otherwise expressly provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to have their
benefits governed by the terms of the plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement date.
Any participant who shall have terminated employment and elected to receive a deferred
retirement benefit under § 107.3 shall have such benefit determined based upon the provisions of
the plan in effect as of the date of such termination of employment and shall not have the benefit
altered by the provisions of this amended and restated Plan.
Limitation of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the employer, the plan administrator,
any fiduciary or any agent or representative of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided from the assets available
in the pension fund, whether such benefits are in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms
of the plan. The Board retains the right to amend or terminate this plan consistent with applicable

in the suspension, reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay status,
and without liability to any person for any such action.
Personal Right of Participant. The right to receive any benefits under this plan is a personal right
of the participant and shall expire upon the death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee,
beneficiary, assignee or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any interest in
any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the terms of this plan or the
provisions of applicable law. A participant's election, failure to make an election or revocation of an
election hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons.
Non-duplication of Benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a participant who is receiving a
retirement benefit under the plan and who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments
suspended until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date such
employment shall cease, except for the participant who is participating in the inservice retirement
option plan sponsored by the employer upon resumption of benefit payments, such participant
shall receive the greater of the amount of the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based
upon final monthly average salary and credited service as of the date that such period of resumed

member receives for the same injuries under social security disability.
Payment of Disability Benefits. Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of
each month, commencing as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following

A participant who shall fail to return within three months to employment as an employee of the
employer upon cessation of total and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement
age shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the disability date, shall not be entitled
to any distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to § 107.2 to the extent that the total
amount of disability payments exceeds the value of the participant's accumulated contributions as
of the disability date, and shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan on account of
any credited service as of the disability date.
Verification of Disability. The plan administrator shall in its sole discretion determine whether a
participant shall have incurred a total and permanent disability. The plan administrator shall rely on
the report of a physician acceptable to the plan administrator. If the plan administrator shall
determine that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to
resume active employment as a police officer or if a participant refuses to undergo a medical
examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a medical examination may not be
required more frequently than once in any given twelve-month period), the payment of disability
retirement benefits shall cease.

benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, then the plan may take whatever action

documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The Board shall, within 60 days
after receipt of the notice requesting such review, (or in special circumstances, such as where
the Board in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice),
submit its decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The
decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific references to the
pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay status shall be filed within 90
days following the date of the first payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted
unless the plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice requesting a review of a denial
of a claim within the time limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.

conclusively upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by it in good
faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or firms, provided such persons or

instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer under its municipal seal by officers
duly authorized to execute such instrument and delivered to the Board provided, however:
That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a deceased participant
of any of the benefits to which each is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made.
That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held under this plan other

shall, except as provided in § 110.5, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the employer.

in accordance with the Act.
Termination of the Plan. The employer shall have the power to terminate this plan in its entirety at
any time by an instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer.

Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such termination, to the extent
funded on such date, shall be nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan, the
employer shall direct either (A) that the plan administrator continue to hold the vested accrued
benefits of participants in the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other
than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such termination until all funds have
been distributed in accordance with the provisions; or (B) that the plan administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to the date.
If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all vested accrued benefits as of
the date of plan termination, priority shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts
attributable to mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are applied to the
distribution of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be distributed and disposed of in
accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination.
Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others entitled to receive a benefit
under the terms of the plan have been satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the
pension fund, such residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as such
return does not contravene any provision of law, and any remaining balance, in excess of
employer contributions, shall be returned to the Commonwealth.
Exclusive Benefit Rule. In the event of the discontinuance and termination of the plan as provided
herein, the employer shall dispose of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan
and applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan shall any part
of the corpus or income of the pension fund, after deducting any administrative or other expenses
properly chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their beneficiaries or their estates.

venation shall be prepared and certified by an approved actuary, as such term is defined in the
Act.
The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial valuation report or investigation
required by the Act or any other expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and
which are directly associated with administering the plan shall be an allowable administrative
expense payable from the assets of the pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include but
not be limited to the following:

management fees.

municipal obligation of the employer to the Board annually and shall certify the accuracy of such
calculations and their conformance with the Act.

the future financial requirements of the plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the
employer with respect to the plan.

rights whatsoever against the employer or the plan administrator as a result of this plan except
those expressly granted hereunder. Participation in this plan shall not give any right to any
employee to be retained in the employ of the employer, nor shall interfere with the right of the
employer to discharge any employee and to deal with such employee without regard to the effect
such treatment might have upon participation in this Plan.
Meaning of Certain Words. For purposes of this plan, the masculine gender shall include the
feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa, in all cases wherever the
person or context shall plainly so require. Headings of articles and sections are inserted only for

(and where applicable, the trustee) information in the employer's possession as the plan

reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan
shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been inserted
herein.
Incapacity of Participant. If any participant shall be physically or mentally incapable of receiving or
acknowledging receipt of any payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so incapacitated and that another
person or institution is maintaining the participant and that no guardian or committee has been
appointed for the participant, may provide for such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such
person or institution so maintaining the participant, and any such payments so made shall be
deemed for every purpose to have been made to such participant.

of a participant who has died, if the plan provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made
to the participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate is pending in the
court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to
the surviving spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there is no surviving spouse, to such
participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided, however, that contained herein shall prevent
the plan administrator from insisting upon the commencement of estate administration
proceedings and the delivery of any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or administrator.

beneficiary any interest in any specific property of the pension fund or any right except to receive
such distributions as are expressly provided for under the plan.

other applicable laws, no past, present or future officer or agent of the employer or plan

§ 1-113. In-Service Retirement Option Plan (IROP).
[Ord. 2007-O-21, 12/12/2007, Art. XIII]
Definitions. The following words and phrases when used in this Part shall have the meanings
given to them in this section only, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
IROP
An in-service retirement option plan.
IROP ACCOUNT
A bookkeeping account created to accept an IROP participant's monthly pension payments
while an IROP participant.
TRUSTEE
The Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township.
Eligibility of Employee to Participate in IROP. Full-time officers of the Newtown Township Police
Department (the "officers"), that have not retired prior to the implementation of the IROP program,
may enter into the IROP on the first day of any month after which they have attained both the age
and service requirements for normal retirement.
Written Election. An officer electing to participate in the IROP must complete and execute an
"IROP option form" prepared by the Township of Newtown, which shall evidence the officer's
participation in the IROP. The form must be signed by the officer and notarized and submitted to
the Township of Newtown, prior to the date on which the officer wishers the IROP option to be
effective. The IROP option notice shall include an irrevocable notice to the Township, by the
officer, that the officer shall resign from employment with the Newtown Township Police
Department effective on a specific date not less than one nor more than five years from the
effective date of the IROP option. In addition, as a condition of participating in the IROP plan, the
officer shall execute and file all retirement documents required by the plan administrator with the

Township for approval. Once a retirement application has been approved by the Township, it is
irrevocable.
Limitation on Pension Accrual. After the effective data of the IROP option, the officer shall no
longer earn or accrue additional years of credited service for pension purposes.
Benefit Calculation. For all retirement purposes, credited service of an officer participating in the
IROP shall remain, as it existed on the day prior to the effective date of commencement of
participation in the IROP. Credited service thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the
calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the Newtown Township Police Pension
Fund. The final monthly average salary of the officer for pension calculation purposes shall
remain, as it existed on the day prior to the effective date of commencement of participation in the
IROP. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the
calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the pension fund. By participating in the
IROP program, the officers agree that they will waive any claim that their pension benefit must be
increased (with back pay) because Act 600 requires that payments be based on final monthly
average salary.
Payments to IROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had
the officer elected to cease employment and receive a normal retirement benefit, shall, upon the
officer commencing participation in the IROP, be paid into a separate account established to
receive the officer's monthly pension payments This account shall be designated the in-service
retirement option plan account.
Investment of IROP Account Funds. The trustee and the Newtown Township Police Benevolent
Association shall select a third party to provide mutual fund or other investment options, recordkeeping
and reporting to the Township for investment of IROP account funds. Each officer shall
select the investment in his or her individual IROP from the array of options provided by the fund
administrator. Each officer shall bear his or her pro rata share of the investment and administration
costs, which share shall be charged against the individual IROP investment accounts of the
officer.
Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the officer's IROP option notice, or such date as the
Township separates the officer from employment, the retirement benefits payable to the officer or
officer's beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid to the officer or beneficiary and shall no longer be
paid to the officer's IROP account. Within 30 days following termination of an officer's employment
pursuant to his or her participation in the IROP program, the balance in the officer's IROP account
shall be paid to the officer pursuant to the distribution options set forth in § 113.9 below.
Distribution Options. Commensurate with IROP participation, an officer shall make an election, on
forms designated by the trustee, of the payout option(s) he or she wishes at the termination of the
IROP period. This election may be changed at anytime prior to termination. The distribution
options are as follows;
A full and single lump sum distribution.
Rollover to another qualified retirement plan (as permitted by law) or to an IRA.
Purchase of an annuity.
Keep the monies in the individual IROP investment account.
Monies kept in the individual IROP investment account may be withdrawn in any manner
desired by the officer.
Disability During IROP.
Permanent Disability. If, while an officer is enrolled in IROP and he or she is injured while on
duty, to the extent that he or she is permanently disabled from performing police work for

Newtown Township as a result of that service-connected disability, the Officer shall be retired
on the basis of a service-connected disability, at the then current normal monthly retirement
benefit. If an officer becomes temporarily disabled during his or her participation in IROP,
disability benefits are not available from the plan.
Temporary Disability. If an officer becomes temporarily disabled during his or her participation
in IROP, the officer shall receive disability pay in the same amount as disabled officers that
are not participating in IROP. In no event shall an officer on temporary disability have the
ability to draw from his or her IROP account. However, notwithstanding any other provision in
this paragraph, if an officer is disabled and has not returned to work as of the time of his or
her required resignation, then such resignation shall take precedence over all other provisions
herein and said officer shall be required to resign. Nothing contained in this section shall be
construed as conferring any legal rights upon any officer or employee, or other person, to a
continuation of employment nor shall participation in the IROP program supersede or limit in
any way the right of the Township to honorably discharge an IROP program participant based
upon an inability to perform his or her full duties as an officer. If an officer becomes
temporarily disabled during his or her participation in IROP, disability benefits are not
available from the plan.
Beneficiary Designation. Commensurate with IROP participation, an officer shall make an election,
on forms designated by the trustee, of the beneficiary or beneficiaries he or she wishes to receive
the monies in his or her individual IROP investment account in the event of his or her death before
all amounts have been distributed.
Death. If an IROP officer dies before the IROP account balances are paid, the officer's legal
beneficiary shall have the same rights as the officer to withdraw the account balance.
Amendment. Any amendments to § 113 shall be consistent with the provisions covering in-service
retirement option plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall be
binding upon all future IROP participants and upon all IROP participants who have balances in the
IROP accounts. This § 113 shall be consistent with the provisions of all future requirements
imposed by amendments to Act 600 or any other Federal, State or local ordinance or resolution.
Change of Law. If any State or Federal law is passed which is inconsistent with the provisions of
this section, this Part will automatically be amended to comply with the applicable provision(s) of
the State or Federal law. Any officer who has already elected to participate in the IROP shall, by
virtue of his or her application to participate in the IROP, be deemed to have his or her IROP
option form and plan automatically amended to conform to the inconsistent Federal or State
imposed requirement(s) on participation in an IROP. The Township shall have an affirmative duty
to meet and discuss any change in law which affects the IROP with the individual participants and
the police bargaining unit.

beneficiary may be rescinded or changed, without the consent of the beneficiary, at any time
provided the participant provides the written notice of the changed designation to the plan

re-qualified participant shall immediately commence the accrual of additional benefits hereunder
upon becoming eligible to participate unless such person received a distribution of accumulated
contributions, in which case the person shall be treated as a new employee in accord with
subsection (1) hereof and shall not receive any credit for prior credited service unless such person
shall repay to the fund the amount of such distribution with interest credited at the same rate and
in the same manner as described in § 121 from the date of distribution to the date of repayment.
Leave of Absence. During any leave of absence that is not an authorized leave of absence, a
participant shall be deemed an inactive participant and shall not earn years of credited service, nor

leave of absence, participation in the plan shall cease on the date on which the leave of absence
commenced.
Recordkeeping. The employer shall furnish the administrator with such information as will aid the
administrator in the administration of the plan. Such information shall include all pertinent data on
employees for purposes of determining their eligibility to participate in this plan initially and
subsequently.
§ 1-123. Contributions.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. III; as amended by Ord. 2012-O-4, 3/14/2012]
Employee Contributions. Employees are neither required nor permitted to make contributions to
the plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer may require employees to contribute to the
plan if, in the opinion of the plan's actuary, additional contributions are necessary to ensure the
stability of the plan's funding status. If employee contributions become necessary then such
contributions will be designated as "pick-up" contributions in accordance with Code § 414(h)(2).
Employer Contributions. The actuary, in accordance with the Act, shall determine the minimum
municipal obligation of the employer. The employer shall pay into the pension fund, by annual
appropriations or otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum municipal
obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall preclude the employer
from contributing an amount in excess of the minimum municipal obligation.
State Aid. General municipal pension system state aid, or any other amount of state aid received
by the employer from the Commonwealth in accordance with the Act, may be deposited into the
pension fund governed by this plan and shall be used to reduce the amount of the minimum
municipal obligation of the employer.
Gifts. To the extent permitted by law, the plan administrator may accept gifts, outright or in trust,
for deposit into the pension fund. The application of such gifts shall be governed by the rules of
the plan.
No Reversion to the Employer. At no time shall it be possible for the plan assets to be used for, or
diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their
beneficiaries, except that contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution is returned within one year
of the date on which discovery of the mistaken payment of the contribution was made or
reasonably should have been made, or the plan is terminated, as provided in § 131.
Employee Contributions. Employees are neither required nor permitted to make contributions to
the plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer may require employees to contribute to the
plan if, in the opinion of the plan's actuary, additional contributions are necessary to ensure the
stability of the plan's funding status. Effective January 1, 2012, and as a condition of participation
in the plan, each non-union employee participant shall contribute to the plan, by payroll deduction,
an amount equal to 2.5% of such participant's compensation. These mandatory employee

contributions will be designated as "pick-up" contributions in accordance with Internal Revenue
Code § 414(h)(2).
§ 1-124. Retirement Benefits.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. IV]
Normal Retirement. A participant who retires upon attainment of normal retirement age shall be
entitled to receive a monthly normal retirement benefit pursuant to subsection (2).
Normal Retirement Benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to
subsection (1) shall receive a benefit commencing on the normal retirement date payable in the
normal form in a monthly amount equal to 2% of the participant's final monthly average
compensation multiplied by the years (and fractions thereof) of credited service.
Early Retirement. Each participant whose employment is terminated prior to normal retirement
date other than by death or disability but after attainment of early retirement age shall be entitled
to receive a monthly early retirement benefit pursuant to subsection (4).
Early Retirement Benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to
subsection (3) may receive a benefit commencing on the normal retirement date payable in the
normal form in a monthly amount equal to the accrued benefit of the participant; or may receive a
benefit commencing on an early retirement date payable in the normal form that is a monthly
amount that is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing on the normal retirement date.
Late Retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond the attainment of normal
retirement age subject to the employer's rules and regulations regarding retirement age. If a
participant who has met the requirements of subsection (1) continues in employment beyond
normal retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until employment ceases and the
participant's retirement actually begins. The retirement benefit of a participant who continues
employment after attainment of normal retirement age shall be calculated in accordance with
subsection (2) on the basis of the final monthly average compensation and credited service as of
such participant's actual retirement.
Application for Benefit. A participant must complete and execute an application for benefit on a
form and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator and deliver the said application to the
plan administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit payments are to commence.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any
other benefit payments shall be due or payable on or before the first day of the month coincident
with or next following the date that is 30 days after the date the plan administrator receives the
application for benefit.
Limitation of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the employer, the plan administrator,
any fiduciary or any agent or representative of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided from the assets available
in the pension fund, whether such benefits are in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms
of the plan. The Board retains the right to amend or terminate this plan consistent with applicable
law at any time, with or without cause and whether or not such action directly or indirectly results
in the suspension, reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay status,
and without liability to any person for any such action.
Small Amounts. If the plan administrator determines that the value of a participant's accrued
benefit is so small as to make monthly pension payments administratively impractical, the plan
administrator may cause such payments to be made at such other periodic intervals as are
administratively practical, but no less frequently than annually, or may make a single lump sum
payment equal to the commuted value of such accrued benefit to the extent permitted under
applicable law.

Personal Right of Participant. Each participant's right to receive any benefits hereunder is
personal and expires on such participant's death. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any interest in any benefits
hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the terms of this plan. A participant's
election, failure to file an election hereunder or revocation of an election shall be final and binding
on all persons.
Retired Participants. The benefit amount of any participant who may have retired prior to the
restatement date shall not be in any way altered by the provisions of this plan, except where
otherwise expressly indicated herein, and shall continue to be determined on the basis of the
terms of the plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement date.
Maximum Benefit Limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, no benefit
provided under this plan attributable to contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual
amount, the amount specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to Code § 415(d),
assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The
limitations described in this subsection shall be governed by the following conditions and
definitions:
Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits)
or where the employee contributes to the plan or makes rollover contributions shall be
adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to
determine the limitation contained herein.
In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of age 62 by the participant,
the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with
applicable regulations to the amount determined pursuant to this section commencing at age
62; however, in the case of a qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period
of at least 15 years of service, as a full-time employee of a police or fire department or as a
member of the Armed Forces of the United States is taken into account in determining the
amount of benefit), the limitation contained herein shall not apply.
In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age 65 by the participant, the
limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with
applicable regulations to the amount determined herein commencing at age 65.
Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer expressed as an annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed
the limitation of this section provided that the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated; however, in the case of a
participant who is not receiving a disability retirement benefit pursuant to § 126(2) or a
survivor benefit pursuant to § 126, with fewer than 10 years of participation, the limitation
expressed in this subsection shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of participation less than
10 but in no event shall this limitation be less than $1,000.
The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for calculation purposes,
shall be applied to all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer as one defined benefit
plan and to all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined
contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted consistent with Code § 415 and
regulations thereunder as applicable to government plans in general and this plan in
particular.
In the case of a survivor benefit under § 127(2), or a disability retirement benefit under
§ 126(2), the adjustment under subsections (11)(B) and (11)(E) hereof shall not apply and the
applicable limitation shall be the limitation contained herein without regard to the age or years
of service or participation of the benefit recipient.

Effective for distributions with annuity starting dates beginning on or after December 31, 2008,
notwithstanding any other plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used
solely for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under § 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of
the Internal Revenue Code as set forth in the applicable maximum benefit limitations section
of the plan is the applicable mortality table under Code § 417(e)(3)(B).
Incorporation of Code § 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (11)
to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in subsection (11)
shall at all times comply with the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations thereunder (as
such apply to governmental plans), the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. Effective for limitation years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, the plan shall comply
with the final regulations issued under Code § 415.
§ 1-125. Payment of Benefits.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. V; as amended by Ord. 2012-O-4, 3/14/2012]
Normal Form of Benefit Payment. The normal form of payment of retirement benefits shall be a
monthly annuity for the life of the participant. If the participant is married on the retirement date
and such marriage has been in existence for at least one year as of such date, the normal form of
payment shall be the joint and 50% survivor annuity described in subsection (2). However, for nonunion
employees, if the death of the retired participant occurs after the payments commence but
before the amount of monthly retirement benefit payments and any single sum or other prior
distributions, if applicable, exceed the accumulated contributions as of the date of employment
termination, the remainder of such amount shall be paid in a single sum to the beneficiary
designated by the participant.
Optional Form of Benefit Payment. The automatic form of payment of retirement benefits shall be
the normal form under subsection (1) unless the participant elects to receive payment of benefits
in an optional form as provided herein. A participant who retires under §§ 124(1), (3), or (5), may
elect an optional form of benefit payment by giving written notice to the plan administrator at least
30 days prior to the date that benefit payments are to commence hereunder. The following are the
available optional forms of benefit payment under the plan.
The life annuity with period certain form of payment shall provide for monthly payments to the
retired participant for the life of the participant. If the participant shall die before a total of 120
monthly payments have been paid then the monthly payments shall continue and be paid to
the beneficiary until a total of 120 monthly payments have been paid to the participant and
beneficiary combined. If the participant shall die after at least 120 monthly payments have
been paid there shall be no additional payments made as the result of or on account of the
death of the participant.
The joint and 50% survivor annuity form of payment shall provide for monthly payments to the
retired participant for the life of the participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of the
participant, monthly payments shall be paid to the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is then living,
in an amount equal to 50% of the amount that was being paid monthly to the participant, for
the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary does not survive the participant there shall be no
additional payments made as the result of or on account of the death of the participant.
The lump sum form of payment shall provide for the applicable benefit to be paid in a single
lump sum payment. This form of payment is only available to participant's that were first hired
into employment before March 9, 1995.
Commencement of Benefits. A participant may elect to commence receiving distribution of
retirement benefits as of the early, normal or late retirement date or may defer such payments to a
date nor later than the required date for commencement of benefits determined under subsection
(4).

Required Distributions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit of any participant who
becomes entitled to benefits prior to death shall be distributed either:
Not later than the required beginning date.
Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning date and extending over
the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and a designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant,
or the joint life expectancies of such participant and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior to the date when the
entire interest has been distributed after distribution of benefits has begun in
accordance with subsection (4)(A)(2) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall
be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under
subsection (4)(A)(2) as of the date of death.
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies before distribution of the benefit
has begun, the entire interest of such employee shall be distributed within five years of the
death of such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of the
employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary, such portion
shall be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than
one year after the date of the employees death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five year rule set forth in the
preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on
the date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant,
then the date on which the employee would have attained age 70 1/2 and, further provided, if
the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph
shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions and procedures shall apply:
"Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar year following the later of
the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which
the employee retires.
The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual designated by the
employee under this plan according to its rules.
Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse
if such amount will become payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under regulations issued by the Security of
the Treasury).
For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee and/or the employee's
spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined but not more
frequently than annually.
General Rules. The requirements of this subsection (4) will take precedence over any
inconsistent provisions of the plan. All distributions required under this subsection (4) will be
determined and made in accordance with § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the
Treasury regulations thereunder, and the employer's good faith interpretation of such code
and regulations.
Direct Rollovers.

Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the plan administrator to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
This subsection (B) shall apply to distributions made on or after January 1, 2006.
Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this section, if a distribution in excess of $1,000 is made and the
distributee does not make an election under subsection (5)(A) and does not elect to receive
the distribution directly, the plan administrator shall make such transfer to an individual
retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer pursuant to § 129(3)(I). The plan
administrator shall notify the, distributee in writing, within a reasonable period of time and as
otherwise prescribed by law, that the distribution may be transferred to another individual
retirement plan.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
DISTRIBUTEE
A participant or former participant. In addition, the participant's or former participant's
surviving spouse and the participant's or former participant's spouse or former spouse
who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code
§ 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
DIRECT ROLLOVER
A payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee or the
plan administrator, if the distributee does not make an election.
Effective January 1, 2008, direct rollovers may be made to a Roth IRA described in
§ 408A of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that the applicable requirements of
Code § 408A are satisfied with respect to any direct rollover to such Roth IRA.
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN
A qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), an individual retirement account described
in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code § 408(b), an annuity
plan described in Code § 403(a), an annuity contract described in Code § 403(b), an
eligible plan under § 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision
of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this plan.
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION
Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a
series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made
for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a
specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is
required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not includible
in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section of the plan, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includable in gross income.
However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in § 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in
§§ 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code (effective for distributions on or after January 1, 2007,
any qualified trust or Code § 403(b) plan) that agrees to separately account for amounts
so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which

is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so
includable.
This Section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2010. Notwithstanding any
provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a nonspouse Beneficiary's
election under this section, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of a plan
distribution (that is payable to such nonspouse beneficiary due to a participant's death) paid in
a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account described in Code
§ 408(a) or to an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b) (other than an
endowment contract) that has been established for the purposes of receiving the distribution
on behalf of such nonspouse beneficiary. For these purposes, a "nonspouse beneficiary" is an
individual who is a designated beneficiary (as defined by § 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal
Revenue Code) of a participant and who is not the surviving spouse of such participant.
Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process and shall be payable only to the participant or
designated beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the subject of a
domestic relations order mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Nonduplication of Benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a participant who is receiving a
retirement benefit under the plan and who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments
suspended until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date such
employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit payments, such participant shall receive the
greater of the amount of the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon final average
monthly compensation and years of credited service as of the date that such period of resumed
employment shall cease.
Employer Provided Retirement Benefit. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
a participant, in lieu of receiving a retirement benefit pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) hereof
based upon the total value of employee and employer contributions to the plan, may choose to
receive a single sum payment in an amount equal to the participant's accumulated contributions
as of the date of termination of employment and a reduced retirement benefit pursuant to
subsections (1) and (2). The value of the retirement benefit shall be reduced by the portion of the
value attributable to that which could have been provided by the value of the participant's
accumulated contributions as of the date of termination of employment.
§ 1-126. Disability Retirement.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. VI; as amended by Ord. 2012-O-4, 3/14/2012]
Disability Retirement. A participant who has completed at least 10 years of credited service and
who shall incur total and permanent disability before attaining normal retirement age shall be
entitled to receive a disability retirement benefit as of the disability date.
Disability Retirement Benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit
under subsection (1) shall receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to the participant's
accrued benefit calculated as of the disability date. The amount of disability retirement benefit
shall be reduced by the full amount of any worker's compensation benefits received by the
participant due to the same incurred total and permanent disability.
Payment of Disability Benefits. Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of the
calendar month following the disability date, and continuing until the earliest of the death of the
participant, cessation of total and permanent disability, or attainment of normal retirement age
(such a participant who attains normal retirement age shall thereafter continue to receive the same

A participant who shall fail to return within three months to employment as an employee of the
employer upon cessation of total and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement
age shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the disability date, and shall not be
entitled to any other benefits under the plan on account of any credited service as of the disability
date. Non-union employee participant's shall not be entitled to any distribution of accumulated
contributions pursuant to § 128(3) to the extent that the total amount of disability payments
exceeds the value of the participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability date.
Verification of Disability. Total and permanent disability shall initially be determined by a licensed
physician mutually agreed to by the participant and the plan administrator. If there is no agreement
to select such a licensed physician, then total and permanent disability shall be determined by a
majority opinion of a group composed of one physician chosen by the participant, one physician
chosen by the plan administrator and one physician chosen jointly by the participant and plan
administrator. If, after payment of a disability retirement benefit has commenced, the plan
administrator shall determine that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has
recovered sufficiently to resume active employment or if a participant refuses to undergo a
medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a medical examination may not
be required more frequently than once in any given twelve-month period), the participant shall
cease to be considered totally and permanently disabled.
Cessation of Disability. A participant must notify the plan administrator of any change which may
cause a cessation of entitlement to receipt of any disability retirement benefit hereunder. If a
participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator of any such change in status
and receives payment of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, then the plan
may take whatever action is necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid amounts,
including legal action or offsetting such amounts against any future payments of retirement or
other benefits under the plan, including the costs of such actions.
§ 1-127. Death Benefits.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. VII; as amended by Ord. 2012-O-4, 3/14/2012]
Survivor Benefit. No benefit shall be payable to any survivor or beneficiary upon or by reason of
the death of any participant except as provided hereafter in this section.
Death of Participant Prior to Retirement. If a participant shall die before retirement and at a time
when such participant would have become a deferred vested participant upon termination of
employment there shall be payable a survivor benefit hereunder. Such survivor benefit shall be
payable to the surviving spouse of the deceased participant, or if there is no surviving spouse then
such survivor benefit shall to payable to another properly named individual beneficiary.
If the participant shall die before attainment of early retirement age, the survivor benefit shall
commence of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the date of death
in an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable to the survivor annuitant if the
participant separated from service on the date of death, survived to attainment of early retirement
age, retired with an immediate joint, and 50% survivor annuity and died on the day after
attainment of early retirement age.
If the participant shall die after attainment of early retirement age and before retirement, the
survivor benefit shall commence as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately
following the date of death in an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable to the
survivor annuitant if the participant had retired with an immediate joint and 50% survivor annuity
on the day prior to the date of death.
Should a participant die prior to becoming vested, the beneficiary shall receive, in a single
payment, an amount equal to the accumulated contributions as of the date of death of the
participant. No other benefit shall be payable.

Death of Participant After Retirement. If a participant shall die after payment of a retirement benefit
has commenced, the only additional benefit payable as a result of or on account of the death of
the participant shall be to the extent and in the manner provided under the form of payment of
benefits that is in effect as of the date of death.
Veterans' Survivor Benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, in the
case of the death of a participant who dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified
military service (as defined in Code § 414(u)), the survivors of the participant are entitled to any
additional benefits under the plan (if any) had the participant resumed and then terminated
employment on account of death.
§ 1-128. Termination of Employment.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. VIII; as amended by Ord. 2012-O-4, 3/14/2012]
Rights of Terminated Employees. A participant who shall cease to be an employee except as
otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall be limited to those rights under this plan contained in the
following sections of this section.
Deferred Vested Benefit. A participant who ceases to be an employee in employment for any
reason other than death, retirement or total and permanent disability, prior to attainment of normal
retirement age, and who has completed at least four years of credited service shall be entitled to
receive a vested retirement benefit equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date
employment ceases and multiplied by the applicable vested percentage from the following
schedule:
Participant's Years of Credited Service Vested Percentage
Less than 4 years 0%
4 years 40%

6 years 50%
7 years 60%
8 years 70%
9 years 80%
10 years 90%
11 years or more 100%
The participant must apply to commence receipt of such benefit by filing a written notice with the
plan administrator at least 30 days before the date for commencement of benefit payments.
Such a participant may commence receipt of retirement benefits, after application has been
made to the plan administrator, on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date of attainment of normal retirement age or may in the alternative, receive a benefit
commencing on a date that would be an eligible early retirement date in an amount that is a
monthly amount that is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that would have commenced as of
the date that would have been the normal retirement date.
Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A participant whose employment with the employer
ceased for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability prior to completion of at
least four years of service shall only be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated
contributions. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions said participant and beneficiary
shall not be entitled to any further payments from the plan.
Forfeiture. To the extent permissible under the Code, rights under this plan shall be subject to
forfeiture pursuant to the Act of July 8, 1978 (P.L. 752, No. 140), known as the Public Employee

§ 1-129. Administration.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. IX]

execute, acknowledge and deliver instruments necessary to implement and effectuate the purpose
of this plan. The plan administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons it
deems appropriate. If the Board does not appoint a plan administrator, the Board shall be the plan
administrator.

remaining members of the committee shall have full power to act pending the filling of such
vacancies.
Authority and Duties of the Plan Administrator. The plan administrator shall have full power and
authority to do whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the proper
administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation or construction placed upon any term
or provision of the plan by the plan administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken in

The plan administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of
the plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the plan, or to waive or fail to apply
any requirements of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the plan administrator
shall have no power to adopt, amend, or terminate the plan, to select or appoint any trustee
or to determine or require any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Board.
Pension Committee Organization. The committee may organize itself in any manner deemed
appropriate to effectuate its purposes hereunder, subject to the following:
The committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time in office and such action may
be taken either by vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting.
The committee may appoint a chairman, a secretary who may, but need not, be a committee
member and such other agents as it may deem advisable.
The committee may, from time to time, authorize any one or more of its members to execute
any document or documents including any application, request, certificate, notice, consent,
waiver or direction and shall notify the Board, in writing, of the name or names of the member
or members so authorized. In the absence of a designation, the chairman shall be deemed to
be so authorized. Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall accept and be fully
protected in relying upon any document executed by the designated member or members (or
the chairman in the absence of a designation) as representing a valid action by the committee
until the committee shall file with such fiduciary a written revocation of such designation.
The committee shall meet at least one time in each plan year, and it shall maintain and keep
such records as are necessary for the efficient operation of the plan or as may be required by
any applicable law, regulation or ruling, and shall provide for the preparation and filing of such
forms, reports or documents as may be required to be filed with any governmental agency or
department and with the participants or other persons entitled to benefits under the plan.
Plan Administrator Costs. The committee members shall each serve without compensation for
services unless otherwise agreed by the Board in writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the committee, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel, actuaries
and other specialists and other costs of administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund
upon approval by the Board to the extent permitted under applicable law and not otherwise paid
by the employer.
Hold Harmless. No member of the Board, the plan administrator, the enrolled actuary, nor any
other person involved in the administration of the plan shall be liable to any person on account of
any act or failure to act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing their
respective duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent permitted by law, the employer shall,
and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless each present member of the committee
and each successor and each of any such member's heirs, executors and administrators, and the
committee's delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is
independent of the employer and which renders services to the plan for a fee) from any and all
liability and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit or
proceeding to which he is or may be made a party by reason of being or having been a member,
delegate or appointee of the committee, except in matters involving criminal liability, intentional or
willful misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature described
above, then there shall be no right of indemnification except to the extent of any deductible
amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent of the amount the claims exceed the
insured amount.
Approval of Benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve or deny any application for
retirement benefits within 30 days following receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be
necessary under the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.

Appeal Procedure. Any person whose application for retirement benefits is denied, who questions
the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so
commence or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall first seek a
resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set forth.
Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan administrator which shall fully
describe the nature of the claim. The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an
initial determination approving or denying the claim.
If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator shall, within 90 days (or such
other period as may be established by applicable law) from the time the application is
received, mail notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may be extended
by the plan administrator if special circumstances so require for up to 90 additional days by
the plan administrator's delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first 90
day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by
the claimant and, if a notice of denial, shall set forth (1) the specific plan provisions on which
the denial is based, (2) an explanation of additional material or information, if any necessary
to perfect such claim and a statement of why such material or information is necessary, and
(3) an explanation of the review procedure.
Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have the right to request a full and
fair review by the Board of the initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Board within 60 days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such review, the
claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The Board shall, within 60 days
after receipt of the notice requesting such review, (or in special circumstances, such as where
the Board in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice),
submit its decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The
decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific references to the
pertinent plan provisions on which the decision is based.
Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay status shall be filed within 90
days following the date of the first payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted
unless the plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice requesting a review of a denial
of a claim within the time limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a claimant to appeal any final
decision hereunder to a court of competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be taken until the entire appeal
procedure of this subsection (8) of the plan has been exhausted.
§ 1-130. The Pension Fund.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. X]
Operation of the Pension Fund. The Board is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject to the provisions of the laws of the
Commonwealth and of this plan and any amendment thereto.
The pension fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the plan and, to the extent not paid
directly by the employer, to pay the expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization
by the employer.

The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the exclusive benefit of its employees. It
expects to make the contributions to the pension fund required under the plan. The employer shall
not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in the pension fund; benefits are payable only
from the pension fund, and only to the extent that there are monies available therein. The pension
fund will consist of all funds held by the employer under the plan, including contributions made
pursuant to the provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The
pension fund shall be held, managed, and administered pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in the plan, the employer has exclusive authority and discretion to
manage and control the pension fund assets. The employer may, however, appoint a trustee,
custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole discretion.
To the extent that the pension fund includes assets of the money purchase pension plan as
described in Appendix 1-1B-A, the assets of the money purchase pension plan may be held and
invested separately from the assets of the Newtown Township Nonuniformed Employees Pension
Plan within the pension fund. Assets in the nonuniformed employees pension plan and the money
purchase pension plan are for the exclusive benefits of each individual plan and assets from one
plan may not be used for the benefit of other plan. In addition, the assets of each individual plan
may be used to pay benefits as provided in that plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the
employer, to pay the expenses of administering that individual plan pursuant to authorization by
the employer.
Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the pension fund, the employer shall have the
following powers, rights and duties, in addition to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law,
unless such duties are delegated.
To retain in cash so much of the pension fund as it deems advisable and to deposit any cash
so retained in any bank or similar financial institution (including any such institution which may
be appointed to serve as trustee hereunder), without liability for interest thereon.
To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and keep said fund invested,
without distinction between principal and income, in securities which are at the time legal
investments for fiduciaries under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same
may be subsequently modified or amended.
To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for cash or on credit at such
times as it may deem appropriate; to exchange such property; to grant options for the
purchase or exchange thereof.
To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization, consolidation, merger, extension
or other similar plan affecting property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease,
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to property held in the fund.
To exercise all voting rights with respect to properly held in the fund and in connection
therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise.
To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed to be appropriate for the purposes of
this plan no matter where situated, including in those cases where a bank has been appointed
to serve as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own commercial bank.
In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all of the powers, rights, and
privileges conferred upon trustees by the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the
same may be subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts, take all
proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although not specifically mentioned herein,
as the employer may deem necessary to administer the pension fund.
To maintain and invest the assets of this plan on a collective and commingled basis with the
assets of other pension plans maintained by the employer, provided that the assets of each

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective commingled trust fund maintained by
a bank or trust company, including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this plan with assets of other
eligible, participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any
assets of the plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to all of
the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as amended from time to time, which
declaration, if required by its terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the plan.
To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry out the provisions of the
plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and demands with respect to
the plan.
To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without liability for the payment of
interest thereon, and to decline to make payment or delivery thereof until final adjudication is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction.
To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the pension fund, any taxes which may be
imposed thereon, whether with respect to the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or
with respect to the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to pay; to contest,
in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand which may be
levied or made against or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to, accountants, investment
advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians, appraisers, consultants, professional plan
administrators and other specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the management of the
fund; to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by it in good
faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or firms, provided such persons or
firms were prudently chosen by the employer, taking into account the interests of the
participants and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to
perform their assigned functions.
To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the management of (including the
power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such
persons or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of
1940, is a bank (as defined in that act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in such
event, the employer shall follow the directions of such investment manager or managers with
respect to the acquisition and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to
review or otherwise manage any fund assets which are subject to the management of such
investment manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee shall not be
permitted to retain such an investment manager except with the express written consent of
the employer.
Common Investments. The employer shall not be required to make separate investments for
individual participants or to maintain separate investments for each participant's account, but may
invest contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.

Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is appointed, the trustee shall be
entitled to such reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation,
and all expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a
charge upon the employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after 30 days
written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and
expenses, and, in the event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or
to be reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be evaluated annually, or at
more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year
end of the fund, and as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and such
additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the condition of the fund and all receipts,
disbursements and other transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the assets of the pension fund,
and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed
trustee, whose decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto, the
participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any information furnished by
brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales
and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in
financial publications.
§ 1-131. Amendment and Termination.
[Ord. 2012-O-3, 3/14/2012, Art. XI]
Amendment of the Plan. The employer may amend this plan at any time or from time to time by an
instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer under its municipal seal by officers
duly authorized to execute such instrument and delivered to the Board; provided, however:
That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a deceased participant
of any of the benefits to which he is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made.
That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held under this plan other
than for the benefit of employees and no funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan
shall, except as provided in subsection (5), ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the
employer.
That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit modification shall be made
unless the cost estimate described in § 132(3) has been prepared and presented to the board
in accordance with the Act.
Termination of the Plan. The employer shall have the power to terminate this plan in its entirety at
any time by an instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer consistent with the
provisions of applicable law.
Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of the Act governing financially
distressed municipalities, the liability of the employer to make contributions to the pension fund
shall automatically terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its adjudication
as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such termination, to the extent

funded on such date, shall be nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan, the
employer shall direct either (A) that the plan administrator continue to hold the vested accrued
benefits of participants in the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other
than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such termination until all funds have
been distributed in accordance with the provisions; or (B) that the plan administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to the date.
If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all vested accrued benefits as of
the date of plan termination, priority shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts
attributable to mandatory or voluntary Participant contributions before assets are applied to the
distribution of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be distributed and disposed of in
accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination.
Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others entitled to receive a benefit
under the terms of the plan have been satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the
pension fund, such residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as such
return does not contravene any provision of law, and any remaining balance, in excess of
employer contributions, shall be returned to the Commonwealth.

whatsoever against the employer or the plan administrator as a result of this plan except those
expressly granted to them hereunder. Participation in this plan shall not give any right to any

reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan

therein.

Benefits for a Deceased Participant. If any benefit shall be payable under the plan to or on behalf
of a participant who has died, if the plan provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made
to the participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant' estate is pending in the
court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to
the surviving spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there be no such surviving spouse, to
such participant's then living issue, per stripes; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall prevent the plan administrator from insisting upon the commencement of estate
administration proceedings and the delivery of any such benefits to a duty appointed executor or

application forms as required by the plan administrator.
Designation of Beneficiary. Any new, full-time employee who becomes a participant hereunder
shall provide a written notice in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator which designates

beneficiary may be rescinded or changed, without the consent of the beneficiary, at any time
provided the participant provides the written notice of the changed designation to the plan
administrator in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator. Any designation of a beneficiary
made in any manner other than one acceptable to the plan administrator shall be null and void and
have no effect under the terms of this plan.
Reemployment. Each person who shall have previously been an employee in employment and
who was a participant in the plan shall be eligible to participate hereunder as of the date of
reemployment and shall commence the accrual of additional benefits under the plan provided that
there shall be no duplication of benefits as provided under § 1-145, Subsection 7.
Change in Status. A participant who remains in the service of the employer but ceases to be an
employee eligible for participation hereunder, or ceases or fails to make any contributions which
are required as a condition of participation hereunder, shall have no further benefit accruals occur
until the individual again qualifies as a participant hereunder eligible to resume such accrual of
benefits.
Leave of Absence. During any leave of absence that is not an authorized leave of absence, a
participant shall be deemed an inactive participant and shall not earn years of credited service, nor
shall any benefits accrue hereunder. If the employee is not re-employed by the expiration of the
leave of absence, participation in the plan shall cease on the date on which the leave of absence
commenced.
Recordkeeping. The employer shall furnish the administrator with such information as will aid the
administrator in the administration of the plan. Such information shall include all pertinent data on
employees for purposes of determining their eligibility to participate in this plan initially and

§ 1-143. Contributions.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Employee Contributions. Each employee shall as a requirement of participation pay regular

pension fund governed by this plan and shall be used to reduce the amount of the minimum
municipal obligation of the employer.
Gifts. To the extent permitted by law, the plan administrator may accept gifts, outright or in trust,
for deposit into the pension fund. The application of such gifts shall be governed by the rules of
the plan.
No Reversion to the Employer. At no time shall it be possible for the plan assets to be used for, or
diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their
beneficiaries, except that contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution is returned within one year
of the date on which discovery of the mistaken payment of the contribution was made or
reasonably should have been made, or the plan is terminated, as provided in § 1-152.
Reduction of Employee Contributions. Notwithstanding the preceding § 1-143, Subsection 1,
payments into the pension fund by participants may be reduced below the minimum percentages
prescribed in § 1-143, Subsection 1, or may be eliminated, and that if such payments are reduced
or eliminated, contributions by the employer will not be required to keep the pension fund
actuarially sound. The employer may, by ordinance or resolution, reduce or eliminate payments
into the pension fund by participants. The employer may rely on an actuarial study performed by
the actuary in determining whether to reduce or eliminate payments into the pension fund by
participants.
§ 1-144. Retirement Benefits.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Normal Retirement. A participant who retires upon attainment of normal retirement age shall be
entitled to receive a monthly normal retirement benefit pursuant to § 1-144, Subsection 2.
Normal Retirement Benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to
§ 1-144, Subsection 1 shall receive a benefit commencing on the normal retirement date payable
in the normal form in a monthly amount equal to 2% of the participant's final average monthly
compensation multiplied by the years (and fractions thereof) of credited service.
Early Retirement. Each participant whose employment is terminated prior to normal retirement
date other than by death or disability but after attainment of early retirement age shall be entitled
to receive a monthly early retirement Benefit pursuant to § 1-144, Subsection 4.
Early Retirement Benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to § 1-
144, Subsection 3 may receive a benefit commencing on the normal retirement date payable in
the normal form in a monthly amount equal to the accrued benefit of the participant; or may
receive a benefit commencing on an early retirement date payable in the normal form that is a
monthly amount that is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing on the normal
retirement date.
Notwithstanding the preceding, a participant who shall have completed at least 20 years of
credited service with the employer at early retirement may commence payment of their accrued
benefit as of their early retirement date without the actuarial equivalent adjustment described
above.
Late Retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond the attainment of normal
retirement age subject to the employer's rules and regulations regarding retirement age. If a
participant who has met the requirements of § 1-144, Subsection 1 continues in employment
beyond normal retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until employment ceases
and the participant's retirement actually begins. The retirement benefit of a participant who
continues employment after attainment of normal retirement age shall be calculated in accordance

with § 1-144, Subsection 2 on the basis of the final average monthly compensation and credited
service as of such participant's actual retirement.
Application for Benefit. A participant must complete and execute an application for benefit on a
form and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator and deliver the said application to the
plan administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit payments are to commence.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any
other benefit payments shall be due or payable on or before the first day of the month coincident
with or next following the date that is 30 days after the date the plan administrator receives the
application for benefit.
Limitation of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the employer, the plan administrator,
any fiduciary or any agent or representative of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided from the assets available
in the pension fund, whether such benefits are in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms
of the plan. The Board retains the right to amend or terminate this plan consistent with applicable
law at any time, with or without cause and whether or not such action directly or indirectly results
in the suspension, reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay status,
and without liability to any person for any such action.
Small Amounts. If the plan administrator determines that the value of a participant's accrued
benefit is so small as to make monthly pension payments administratively impractical, the plan
administrator may cause such payments to be made at such other periodic intervals as are
administratively practical, but no less frequently than annually. If the value of the participant's
accrued benefit is $1,000 or less, the plan administrator may make a single lump sum payment
equal to the commuted value of such accrued benefit to the extent permitted under applicable law.
(If the value of the accrued benefit is over $1,000, the participant must consent to the lump sum
distribution.)
Personal Right of Participant. Each participant's right to receive any benefits hereunder is
personal and expires on such participant's death. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any interest in any benefits
hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the terms of this plan. A participant's
election, failure to file an election hereunder or revocation of an election shall be final and binding

amount, the amount specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to Code § 415(d),
assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The

In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age 65 by the participant, the
limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with
applicable regulations to the amount determined herein commencing at age 65;
Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all defined benefit plans

the limitation of this section provided that the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated;
In the case of a participant with fewer than 10 years of service or participation, the limitation
expressed in this § 1-144, Subsection 11 shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of
participation less than 10 with respect to Code § 415(b)(1)(A) or each year of service less
than 10 years in the case of the limitation in Subsection 11D; but in no event shall this

regulations thereunder as applicable to government plans in general and this plan in
particular;
In the case of a survivor benefit under § 1-147, Subsection 2, or a disability retirement benefit

the purchase of permissive service credits; and
Effective for distributions with annuity starting dates beginning on or after December 31, 2008,
notwithstanding any other plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used
solely for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the
Internal Revenue Code as set forth in the applicable maximum benefit limitations section of
the plan is the applicable mortality table under Code § 417(e)(3)(B).

contributions, unless the contributions are being "picked-up" pursuant to Code § 414(h)(2)]
under this plan shall at all times comply with the provisions of Code § 415(c) and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. If

be aggregated with this plan for purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(c), and
if the annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under Code § 415(c), annual
additions will first be reduced under the other plan. If there is more than one other plan,
annual additions will first be reduced under the plan with the greatest amount of annual
additions.

basis of the terms of the plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement date.
§ 1-145. Payment of Benefits.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Normal Form of Benefit Payment. The normal form of payment of retirement benefits shall be a
monthly annuity for the life of the participant. If the participant is married on the retirement date
and such marriage has been in existence for at least one year as of such date, the normal form of
payment shall be the joint and 50% survivor annuity described in § 145.2.
Optional Form of Benefit Payment.
The automatic form of payment of retirement benefits shall be the normal form under § 1-145,
Subsection 1 unless the participant elects to receive payment of benefits in an optional form
as provided herein. A participant who retires under § 1-144, Subsection 1, 3, or 5, may elect
an optional form of benefit payment by giving written notice to the plan administrator at least
30 days prior to the date that benefit payments are to commence hereunder.
The following are the available optional forms of benefit payment under the plan.
The life annuity with period certain form of payment shall provide for monthly payments to
the retired participant for the life of the participant. If the participant shall die before a total
of 120 monthly payments have been paid then the monthly payments shall continue and
be paid to the beneficiary until a total of 120 monthly payments have been paid to the
participant and beneficiary combined. If the participant shall die after at least 120 monthly
payments have been paid there shall be no additional payments made as the result of or
on account of the death of the participant.
The joint and 50% survivor annuity form of payment shall provide for monthly payments
to the retired participant for the life of the participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of
the participant, monthly payments shall be paid to the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is
then living, in an amount equal to 50% of the amount that was being paid monthly to the
participant, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary does not survive the participant
there shall be no additional payments made as the result of or on account of the death of
the participant.
The lump sum form of payment shall provide for the applicable benefit to be paid in a
single lump sum payment. This form of payment is only available to participant's that
were first hired into employment before March 9, 1995.
Commencement of Benefits. A participant may elect to commence receiving distribution of
retirement benefits as, if the early, normal or late retirement date or may defer such payments to a

date nor later than the required date for commencement of benefits determined under § 1-145,
Subsection 4.
Required Distributions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit of any participant who
becomes entitled to benefits prior to death shall be distributed either:
Not later than the required beginning date; or
Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning date and extending over
the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and a designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant,
or the joint life expectancies of such participant and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior to the date when the
entire interest has been distributed after distribution of benefits has begun in accordance
with Subsection A(2) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at
least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under Subsection A(2) as
of the date of death.
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies before distribution of the benefit
has begun, the entire interest of such employee shall be distributed within five years of the
death of such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of the
employees' interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary, such portion
shall be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than
one year after the date of the employees death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in the
preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on
the date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant,
then the date on which the employee would have attained age 70 1/2 and, further provided, if
the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph
shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions and procedures shall apply:
"Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar year following the later of
the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which
the employee retires.
The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual designated by the
employee under this plan according to its rules.
Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse
if such amount will become payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under regulations issued by the Security of
the Treasury).
For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee and/or the employee's
spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined but not more
frequently than annually.
General Rules. The requirements of this § 1-145, Subsection 4 will take precedence over any
inconsistent provisions of the plan. All distributions required under this § 1-145, Subsection 4
will be determined and made in accordance with § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code
and the Treasury regulations thereunder, and the employer's good faith interpretation of such
Code and Regulations.

5. Direct Rollovers.
This section applies to distributions made on or after December 31, 2001. Notwithstanding
any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election
under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the
plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is equal to at
least $500 paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct
rollover.
This § 1-145, Subsection 5B shall apply to distributions made on or after January 1, 2006.
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this section, if a distribution in excess of $1,000 is made and the
distributee does not make an election under § 1-145, Subsection 5A and does not elect to
receive the distribution directly, the plan administrator shall make such transfer to an
individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer pursuant to § 1-150, Subsection 3I.
The plan administrator shall notify the distributee in writing, within a reasonable period of time
and as otherwise prescribed by law, that the distribution may be transferred to another
individual retirement plan.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
"Eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated
beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years of more; any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution
that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section of the plan, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the
portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross
income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account
or annuity described in § 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in § 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to
separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for
the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of
such distribution which is not so includible.
"Eligible retirement plan" is a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), an individual
retirement account described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code § 403(a), an annuity
contract described in Code § 403(b), an eligible deferred compensation plan under
§ 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or
any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which
agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan.
"Distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or
former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in Code § 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
"Direct rollover" is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee.

Effective January 1, 2008, direct rollovers may be made to a Roth IRA described in
§ 408A of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that the applicable requirements of
Code § 408A are satisfied with respect to any direct rollover to such Roth IRA.
This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2010. Notwithstanding any
provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a nonspouse beneficiary's
election under this section, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of a plan
distribution (that is payable to such nonspouse beneficiary due to a participant's death) paid in
a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account described in Code
§ 408(a) or to an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b) (other than an
endowment contract) that has been established for the purposes of receiving the distribution
on behalf of such nonspouse beneficiary. For these purposes, a "nonspouse beneficiary" is an
individual who is a designated beneficiary (as defined by § 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal
Revenue Code) of a participant and who is not the surviving spouse of such participant.
Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process and shall be payable only to the participant or
designated beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the subject of a
domestic relations order, mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction, that clearly provides for
proper distribution of a portion of the pension benefit payments to an alternate payee (former
spouse of the participant) and does not require any benefit to be paid in excess of the available
earned and accrued under the plan.
Nonduplication of Benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a participant who is receiving a
retirement benefit under the plan and who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments
suspended until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date such
employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit payments, such participant shall receive the
greater of the amount of the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon final average
monthly compensation and years of credited service as of the date that such period of resumed
employment shall cease.
Temporary Service Increment Benefit. Effective January 1, 2019, and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, a participant who was hired on or before December 31, 2015 and who shall
retire after having completed years of credited service in excess of 25 years shall be eligible to
receive a temporary service increment benefit in addition to the normal, early, disability or deferred
vested retirement benefit. The amount of the temporary service increment benefit shall be equal to
$100 per month for each year of completed year of credited service in excess of 25 years, to a
maximum of $500 per month after 30 years of credited service. The temporary service increment
benefit shall be payable for 60 months commencing at the same time as the participant's monthly
normal, early, disability or deferred vested retirement benefits are payable to the participant. The
temporary service increment benefit shall not be payable during IROP participation.
§ 1-146. Disability Retirement.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Disability Retirement. A participant who has completed at least 10 years of credited service and
who shall incur total and permanent disability before attaining normal retirement age shall be
entitled to receive a disability retirement benefit as of the disability date.
Disability Retirement Benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit
under § 1-146, Subsection 1 shall receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to the participant's
accrued benefit calculated as of the disability date. The amount of disability retirement benefit
shall be reduced by the full amount of any worker's compensation benefits received by the
participant due to the same incurred total and permanent disability.

Payment of Disability Benefits. Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of the
calendar month following the disability date, and continuing until the earliest of the death of the
participant, cessation of total and permanent disability, or attainment of normal retirement age
(such a participant who attains normal retirement age shall thereafter continue to receive the same
amount of monthly benefit which shall be deemed to be the normal retirement benefit).
A participant who shall fail to return within three months to employment as an employee of the
employer upon cessation of total and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal
retirement age shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the disability date, shall
not be entitled to any distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to § 1-148,
Subsection 4 to the extent that the total amount of disability payments exceeds the value of
the participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability date, and shall not be entitled
to any other benefits under the plan on account of any credited service as of the disability
date.
Verification of Disability. Total and permanent disability shall initially be determined by a licensed
physician mutually agreed to by the participant and the plan administrator. If there is no agreement
to select such a licensed physician, then total and permanent disability shall be determined by a
majority opinion of a group composed of one physician chosen by the participant, one physician
chosen by the plan administrator and one physician chosen jointly by the participant and plan
administrator. If, after payment of a disability retirement benefit has commenced, the plan
administrator shall determine that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has
recovered sufficiently to resume active employment or if a participant refuses to undergo a
medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a medical examination may not
be required more frequently than once in any given twelve-month period), the participant shall
cease to be considered totally and permanently disabled.
Cessation of Disability. A participant must notify the plan administrator of any change which may
cause a cessation of entitlement to receipt of any disability retirement benefit hereunder. If a
participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator of any such change in status
and receives payment of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, then the plan
may take whatever action is necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid amounts,
including legal action or offsetting such amounts against any future payments of retirement or
other benefits under the plan, including the costs of such actions.
§ 1-147. Death Benefits.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Survivor Benefit. No benefit shall be payable to any survivor or beneficiary upon or by reason of
the death of any participant except as provided hereafter in this § 1-147.
Death of Participant Prior to Retirement. If a participant shall die before retirement and at a time
when such participant would have become a deferred vested participant upon termination of
employment there shall be payable a survivor benefit hereunder. Such survivor benefit shall be
payable to the surviving spouse of the deceased participant, or if there is no surviving spouse then
such survivor benefit shall be payable to another properly named individual beneficiary.
If the participant shall die before attainment of early retirement age, the survivor benefit shall
commence as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the date of
death in an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable to the survivor
annuitant if the participant separated from service on the date of death, survived to attainment
of early retirement age, retired with an immediate joint and 50% survivor annuity and died on
the day after attainment of early retirement age.
If the participant shall die after attainment of early retirement age and before retirement, the
survivor benefit shall commence as of the first day of the month coincident with or

immediately following the date of death in an amount equal to the amount that would have
been payable to the survivor annuitant if the participant had retired with an immediate joint
and 50% survivor annuity on the day prior to the date of death.
Death of Participant After Retirement. If a participant shall die after payment of a retirement benefit
has commenced, the only additional benefit payable as a result of or on account of the death of
the participant shall be to the extent and in the manner provided under the form of payment of
benefits that is in effect as of the date of death.
Death of Participant Prior to Survivor Benefit Eligibility. If a participant shall die before payment of
benefit has commenced and without eligibility for payment of a survivor benefit under § 1-147,
Subsection 2, the beneficiary shall be eligible to receive a distribution in an amount equal to the
accumulated contributions of the participant as of the date of death of the participant. If the
participant has received disability retirement benefits hereunder, the amount of distribution of
accumulated contributions shall be reduced by the amount of disability retirement benefits which
have been paid hereunder.
Veterans' Survivor Benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, in the
case of the death of a participant who dies on or after January 1, 2007 while performing qualified
military service [as defined in Code § 414(u)], the survivors of the participant are entitled to any
additional benefits (if any) under the plan (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of
qualified military service) had the participant resumed and then terminated employment on
account of death.
§ 1-148. Termination of Employment.

otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall be limited to those rights under this plan contained in the
following sections of this § 1-148.

retirement or total and permanent disability, prior to attainment of normal retirement age, and
who has completed at least four years of credited service shall be entitled to receive a vested
retirement benefit equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date employment ceases
and multiplied by the applicable vested percentage from the following schedule:

has been made to the plan administrator, on the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date of attainment of normal retirement age or may in the alternative, receive a
benefit commencing on a date that would be an eligible early retirement date pursuant to § 1-

Forfeiture. Rights under this plan shall be subject to forfeiture as provided by the act of July 8,
1978 (P.L. 752, No. 140), known as the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act.[1]

Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A participant whose employment with the employer
shall terminate for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment
of early or normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated
contributions. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and beneficiary
shall not be entitled to any further payments from the plan. If a participant elects to receive a
distribution of their accumulated contributions, such distribution would be paid in lieu of a deferred
retirement benefit under § 1-148, Subsection 2.
§ 1-149. In-Service Retirement Option Program.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
In-Service Retirement Option Program. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary,
any participant who shall attain eligibility to retire and receive a normal retirement benefit under
§ 1-144, Subsection 2, effective on or after the spin off date, shall be eligible to elect to participate
in the In-Service Retirement Option Program ("IROP") as hereinafter set forth in this § 1-149.
IROP Election. A participant who shall become eligible to participate in the IROP must make

participant as witnessed by a notary public of good standing with the commonwealth, must be a
prospective election only, must include an irrevocable commitment to terminate employment at
least one year after the date the election is made and not more than five years after such date,
must include all required completed retirement application forms and documents as determined by
the plan administrator, and must include an absolute agreement that there shall be no additional
benefit accrual under the plan either through increases in credited service or changes in final
average monthly compensation on and after the election date for the IROP.
IROP Participation. A participant who shall make a valid election under § 1-149, Subsection 2 that
is accepted by and agreed to by the employer shall become an IROP participant as of the date of
election contained in the IROP election or such other date as agreed to by and between the
participant and the employer. As of such date all accruals of any kind affecting the retirement
benefit under this plan shall cease and the retirement benefit of such electing participant shall be
irrevocably determined as of the date of commencement of IROP participation.
IROP Account. The plan shall establish a bookkeeping account in the name of each IROP
participant. The amount of the monthly retirement benefit that would otherwise have been paid to
the participant from the plan if the participant had retired from employment and commenced
receipt of a monthly retirement benefit as of the IROP election date shall be credited to the
participant's IROP account as of the date that such monthly benefit would otherwise have been
paid to the participant, for so long as the participant continues in employment in accord with the
IROP election.
Investment of IROP Account. The plan shall offer a selection of investment options such as mutual
funds for use in the investment of IROP account funds. The Board shall be solely responsible for
the selection of the available investment options that can be offered under the plan. All IROP

accounts under the plan shall be at all times an integral part of the total pension fund and shall not
become independent accounts of any kind. Each IROP participant shall be given the opportunity
to select from among the investment options offered and a pro rata share of the pension fund
assets shall be invested in accord with such selection. The respective gains and losses along with
any administrative expenses shall be allocated to each affected IROP account balance. The Board
shall be fully relieved of any and all liability related to the investment performance applicable to
each IROP account when the properly given instructions of the participant shall have been
followed regarding the selection of investment options applicable to such participant's IROP
account. Should any IROP participant fail to select any investment option applicable to the IROP
account, the balance to the credit of such participant shall continue to be a part of the pension
fund, shall not be credited with any investment gains or losses, and shall be charged the pro rata
share of any expense incurred on behalf of the participant.
Termination of Employment. Effective as of the date of termination of employment of an IROP
participant, the monthly retirement benefit shall no longer be credited to the participant's IROP
account, but rather shall commence being paid to the participant. The participant shall elect one of
the options for disposition of the IROP account under § 1-149, Subsection 7 hereof. Disposition of
the IROP account shall occur within not more than 30 days after the participant has made an
election on a form and in a manner acceptable to the plan administrator.
Disposition of IROP Account Upon Employment Termination.
An IROP participant may select one of the following options for disposition of the IROP
account upon termination of employment.
A complete single sum distribution of the IROP account balance as of the date of
distribution less any required income tax withholding amounts.
A complete rollover of the entire IROP account balance to another qualified retirement
plan (as permitted by law) or to an individual retirement account ("IRA").
Purchase of an annuity using the full distributable value of the IROP account balance as
of the date of the purchase.
Retain the IROP account under the plan for disposition upon application at a later date
using one of the other options.
If an IROP participant shall fail to select a disposition option upon termination of employment
such IROP participant shall be deemed to have selected Subsection 7A(4) above.
Disability of IROP Participant. If an IROP participant shall incur a total and permanent disability
during the period of employment that is governed by the IROP election, the participant shall be
deemed to have finally terminated employment as of the disability date and shall have the benefits
hereunder determined in accord with § 1-149, Subsection 6 hereof. There shall be no disability
benefit of any other kind payable from or under this plan in these circumstances. If an IROP
participant shall incur a temporary disability during the period of employment governed by the
IROP election, there shall be no distributions from the IROP until the date upon which the
participant is scheduled to terminate employment under the terms of the IROP election at which
time the participant shall terminate employment whether such temporary disability may be ongoing
or not. During the period of temporary disability there shall be no disability benefits of any kind
payable from or under the plan.
Death of IROP Participant. If an IROP participant shall die at a time when there is a positive
balance in that participant's IROP account, the beneficiary of said deceased participant shall have
the same rights to a distribution of the IROP account as the participant would have if still living.

Plan Administrator. The Board of the employer may appoint a Committee or an individual to be the
plan administrator. The plan administrator shall have the power and authority to do all acts and to
execute, acknowledge and deliver instruments necessary to implement and effectuate the purpose
of this plan. The plan administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons it
deems appropriate. If the Board does not appoint a plan administrator, the Board shall be the plan
administrator.
Pension Committee. If the Board shall appoint a Pension Committee, it shall consist of five
members, one of whom shall be an employee covered by the plan and one of whom shall be a
participant in the plan. Each member of the Pension Committee shall serve in that capacity until
the earliest of resignation, death, removal or otherwise. Each member may resign by delivering
written notice to the Board and other members of the Committee. Vacancies on the Committee
shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made; provided, however, that
the remaining members of the Committee shall have full power to act pending the filling of such
vacancies.
Authority and Duties of the Plan Administrator.
The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do whatever shall, in its
judgment, be reasonably necessary for the proper administration and operation of the plan.
The interpretation or construction placed upon any term or provision of the plan by the plan
administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken in good faith shall, upon the
Board's review and approval thereof, be final and conclusive upon all parties hereto, whether
employees, participants or other persons concerned. By way of specification and not limitation
and except as specifically limited hereafter, the plan administrator is authorized:
To construe this plan;
To determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any employee to participate herein;
To compute the amount and source of any benefit payable hereunder to any participant
or beneficiary;
To authorize any and all disbursements;
To prescribe any procedure to be followed by any participant or other person in filing any
application or election;
To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required by law or as the
administrator deems appropriate, information explaining the plan;
To require from the employer or any participant such information as shall be necessary
for the proper administration of the plan;
To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the administration of the plan, including
such legal, clerical, accounting and actuarial services as may be required by any
applicable law or laws; and
To select an individual retirement plan provider (either the state or a federally regulated
financial institution) and invest funds in connection with the rollover of mandatory
distributions as described in § 1-149, Subsection 5B.
The plan administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of the
plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the plan, or to waive or fail to apply any
requirements of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the plan administrator shall
have no power to adopt, amend, or terminate the plan, to select or appoint any Trustee or to

determine or require any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively reserved to
the Board.
Pension Committee Organization. The Committee may organize itself in any manner deemed
appropriate to effectuate its purposes hereunder, subject to the following:
The Committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time in office and such action
may be taken either by vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting.
The Committee may appoint a Chairman, a Secretary who may, but need not, be a
Committee member and such other agents as it may deem advisable.
The Committee may, from time to time, authorize any one or more of its members to execute
any document or documents, including any application, request, certificate, notice, consent,
waiver or direction and shall notify the Board, in writing, of the name or names of the member
or members so authorized. In the absence of a designation, the Chairman shall be deemed to
be so authorized. Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall accept and be fully
protected in relying upon any document executed by the designated member or members (or
the Chairman in the absence of a designation) as representing a valid action by the
Committee until the Committee shall file with such fiduciary a written revocation of such
designation.
The Committee shall meet at least one time in each plan year, and it shall maintain and keep
such records as are necessary for the efficient operation of the plan or as may be required by
any applicable law, regulation or ruling, and shall provide for the preparation and filing of such
forms, reports or documents as may be required to be filed with any governmental agency or
department and with the participants or other persons entitled to benefits under the plan.
Plan Administrator Costs. The Committee members shall each serve without compensation for
services unless otherwise agreed by the Board in writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the Committee, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel, actuaries
and other specialists and other costs of administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund
upon approval by the Board to the extent permitted under applicable law and not otherwise paid
by the employer.
Hold Harmless. No member of the Council nor the plan administrator nor any other person
involved in the administration of the plan (other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is
independent of the employer and which renders services to the plan for a fee) shall be liable to
any person on account of any act or failure to act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith in performing their respective duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent permitted by
law, the employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
member of the Committee and each successor and each of any such member's heirs, executors
and administrators, and the Committee's delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank,
firm or corporation which is independent of the employer and which renders services to the plan
for a fee) from any and all liability and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in
any action, suit or proceeding to which he is or may be made a party by reason of being or having
been a member, delegate or appointee of the Committee, except in matters involving criminal
liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a
nature described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification except to the extent of any
deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent of the amount the claims exceed
the insured amount.
Approval of Benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve or deny any application for
retirement benefits within 30 days following receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be
necessary under the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.

Appeal Procedure. Any person whose application for retirement benefits is denied, who questions
the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so
commence or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall first seek a
resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set forth.
Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan administrator which shall fully
describe the nature of the claim. The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an
initial determination approving or denying the claim.
If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator shall, within 90 days (or such
other period as may be established by applicable law) from the time the application is
received, mail notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may be extended
by the plan administrator if special circumstances so require for up to 90 additional days by
the plan administrator's delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the claimant and, if a notice of denial, shall set forth the specific plan
provisions on which the denial is based, an explanation of additional material or information, if
any necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such material or information is
necessary, and an explanation of the review procedure.
Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have the right to request a full and
fair review by the Board of the initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Board within 60 days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such review, the
claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The Board shall, within 60 days
after receipt of the notice requesting such review, (or in special circumstances, such as where
the Board in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice),
submit its decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The
decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific references to the
pertinent plan provisions on which the decision is based.
Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay status shall be filed within 90
days following the date of the first payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted
unless the plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice requesting a review of a denial
of a claim within the time limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a claimant to appeal any final
decision hereunder to a court of competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa. C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be taken until the entire appeal
procedure of this § 1-150, Subsection 8 of the plan has been exhausted.
§ 1-151. The Pension Fund.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Operation of the Pension Fund. The Board is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject to the provisions of the laws of the
commonwealth and of this plan and any amendment thereto.
The pension fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the plan and, to the extent not
paid directly by the employer, to pay the expenses of administering the plan pursuant to
authorization by the employer.

therein. The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer under the plan,
including contributions made pursuant to the provisions hereof and the investments,
reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed, and
administered pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
plan, the employer has exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the pension
fund assets. The employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or investment
manager, at its sole discretion.
Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the pension fund, the employer shall have the
following powers, rights and duties, in addition to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law,

amended.
To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for cash or on credit at such

or other similar plan affecting property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease,
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to property held in the fund.
To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the fund and in connection
therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise.
To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed to be appropriate for the purposes of
this plan no matter where situated, including in those cases where a bank has been appointed
to serve as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own commercial bank.
In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all of the powers, rights, and
privileges conferred upon trustees for fiduciaries in accordance with Chapter 73 of the
Pennsylvania Probate Estates and Fiduciaries Investment Code, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, or as the same may be subsequently modified or
amended, and the power to do all acts, take all proceedings and execute all rights and
privileges, although not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem necessary
to administer the pension fund.

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.

a bank or trust company, including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this plan with assets of other

eligible, participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any
assets of the plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to all of
the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as amended from time to time, which
declaration, if required by its terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the plan.
To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry out the provisions of the
plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and demands with respect to
the plan.
To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without liability for the payment of
interest thereon, and to decline to make payment or delivery thereof until final adjudication is

imposed thereon, whether with respect to the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or
with respect to the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to pay; to contest,
in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand which may be
levied or made against or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
To appoint any persons or firms (including but not limited to, accountants, investment
advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians, appraisers, consultants, professional plan
administrators and other specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the management of the
fund; to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by it in good
faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or firms, provided such persons or
firms were prudently chosen by the employer, taking into account the interests of the
participants and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to
perform their assigned functions.
To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the management of (including the
power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such
persons or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of
1940, is a bank (as defined in that act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in such
event, the employer shall follow the directions of such investment manager or managers with
respect to the acquisition and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to
review or otherwise manage any fund assets which are subject to the management of such
investment manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee shall not be
permitted to retain such an investment manager except with the express written consent of
the employer.
Common Investments. The employer shall not be required to make separate investments for
individual participants or to maintain separate investments for each participant's account, but may
invest contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is appointed, the trustee shall be
entitled to such reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation,
and all expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a
charge upon the employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after 30 days'
written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and

expenses, and, in the event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or
to be reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be evaluated annually, or at
more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year
end of the fund, and as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and such
additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the condition of the fund and all receipts,
disbursements and other transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the assets of the pension fund,
and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed
trustee, whose decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto, the
participants and Beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any information furnished by
brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales
and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in
financial publications.
§ 1-152. Amendment and Termination.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Amendment of the Plan. The employer may amend this plan at any time or from time to time by an
instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer under its municipal seal by officers
duly authorized to execute such instrument and delivered to the Board provided, however:
That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a deceased participant
of any of the benefits to which he is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held under this plan other
than for the benefit of employees and no funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan
shall, except as provided in § 1-152, Subsection 5, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the
employer; and
That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit modification shall be made
unless the cost estimate described in § 1-153, Subsection 3 has been prepared and
presented to the Board in accordance with the Act.
Termination of the Plan. The employer shall have the power to terminate this plan in its entirety at
any time by an instrument in writing executed in the name of the employer consistent with the
provisions of applicable law.
Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of the Act governing financially
distressed municipalities, the liability of the employer to make contributions to the pension fund
shall automatically terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its adjudication
as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the plan or complete
discontinuance of contributions, all amounts of vested benefits accrued by the affected
participants as of the date of such termination or complete discontinuance of contributions, to the
extent funded on such date, shall be nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the
plan, the employer shall direct either that the plan administrator continue to hold the funded
accrued benefits of participants in the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan
(other than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such termination until all funds

have been distributed in accordance with the provisions; or that the plan administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the funded accrued benefit.
If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all vested accrued benefits as
of the date of plan termination or complete discontinuance of contributions, priority shall first
be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to mandatory or voluntary participant
contributions before assets are applied to the distribution of any accrued benefits attributable
to other sources hereunder.
All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be distributed and disposed of in
accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by
the employer which effects such termination.
Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others entitled to receive a benefit
under the terms of the plan have been satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the
pension fund, such residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as such
return does not contravene any provision of law, and any remaining balance, in excess of
employer contributions, shall be returned to the commonwealth.
Exclusive Benefit Rule. In the event of the discontinuance and termination of the plan as provided
herein, the employer shall dispose of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan
and applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan shall any part
of the corpus or income of the pension fund, after deducting any administrative or other expenses
properly chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their beneficiaries or their estates.
§ 1-153. Funding Standard Requirements.
[Ord. 2016-O-3, 6/22/2016, as amended by Ord. No. 2019-O-1, 3/27/2019]
Actuarial Valuations. The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least biennially.
Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the beginning of each plan year
occurring in an odd-numbered calendar year, beginning with the year 1985 and shall be prepared
and certified by an approved actuary, as such term is defined in the Act. The expenses attributable
to the preparation of any actuarial valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act
or any other expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and which are directly
associated with administering the plan shall be an allowable administrative expense payable from
the assets of the pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include but not be limited to the
following:
Investment costs associated with obtaining authorized investments and investment
management fees;
Accounting expenses;
Premiums for insurance coverage on fund assets;
Reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or to defend the fund; and
Legitimate travel and education expenses for plan officials; provided, however, that the
municipal officials of the employer, in their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services provided to
the plan to ensure that the expenses are necessary, reasonable and benefit the plan; and
further provided, that the plan administrator shall document all such expenses item by item,
and where necessary, hour by hour.

court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to
the surviving spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there be no such surviving spouse, to
such participant's then living issue, per stripes; provided, however, that nothing contained herein

by resolution, a list of reasonable fees relative to requests for public records. The Township shall
maintain a list of applicable fees and disseminate the list to requesters.
No fee may be imposed for review of a record to determine whether the record is subject to
access under law.
Prior to granting access, the Township may require prepayment of estimated fees when the fees
required to fulfill the request are expected to exceed $100.
The Open Records Officer may waive duplication fees when the requester duplicated the record or
the Open Records Officer deems it is in the public interest to do so.

written request is received by the Open Records Officer.

§ 1-1209. Extension of Time.
[Res. 2008-R-24, 12/17/2008, § V]
If the Open Records Officer determines that an extension of time is required to respond to a
request, in accordance with the factors stated in law, written notice shall be sent within five
business days of receipt of request. The notice shall indicate that the request for access is being
reviewed, the reason that the review requires an extension, a reasonable date when the response
is expected, and an estimate of applicable fees owed when the record becomes available.
One thirty day extension for one of the listed reasons does not require the consent of the
requester. If the response is not given by the specified date, it shall be deemed denied on the day
following that date.
A requester may consent in writing to an extension that exceeds 30 days, in which case the
request shall be deemed denied on the day following the date specified in the notice if the Open
Records Officer has not provided a response by that date.
§ 1-1210. Granting of Request.
[Res. 2008-R-24, 12/17/2008, § V]

the requester that access is granted and either include information on the regular business hours
of the administration office, provide electronic access, or state where the requester may go to
inspect the records or information electronically at a publicly accessible site. The response shall
include a copy of the fee schedule in effect, a statement that prepayment of fees is required in a
specified amount if access of the records will cost in excess of $100, and the medium in which the
records will be provided.
A public record shall be provided to the requester in the medium requested if it exists in that form;
otherwise, it shall be provided in its existing medium. However, the Township is not required to
permit use of its computers.
The Open Records Officer may respond to a records request by notifying the requester that the
record is available through publicly accessible electronic means or that the Township shall provide
access to inspect the record electronically. If the requester, within 30 days following receipt of the
Township's notice, submits a written request to have the record converted to paper, the Township
shall provide access in printed form within five days of receipt of the request for conversion to
paper. A public record that the Township does not possess but is possessed by a third party with
whom the Township has contracted to perform a governmental function and which directly relates
to that governmental function shall be considered a public record of the Township. When the
Township contracts with such a third party, the Township shall require the contractor to agree in
writing to comply with requests for such records and to provide the Township with the requested
record in a timely manner to allow the Township to comply with law.
If the Open Records Officer determines that a public record contains information both subject to
and not subject to access, the Open Records Officer shall grant access to the information subject
to access and deny access to the information not subject to access. The Open Records Officer
shall redact from the record the information that is not subject to access. The Open Records
Officer shall not deny access to a record if information is able to be redacted.
If the Open Records Officer responds to a requester that a copy of the requested record is
available for delivery at the administration office and the requester does not retrieve the record
within 60 days of the Township's response, the Township shall dispose of the copy and retain any
fees paid to date.

Open Records Officer shall notify any third party that provided the record to the Township, the

contains a trade secret or confidential proprietary information, in accordance with law and

Records Officer on whose authority the denial is issued.

The Open Records Officer may deny a request for access to a record if the requester has made
repeated requests for that same record and repeated requests have placed an unreasonable
burden on the Township.
The Open Records Officer may deny a request for access to a record when timely access is not
possible due to a disaster, or when access may cause physical damage or irreparable harm to the
record. To the extent possible, a record's content shall be made accessible even when the record
is physically unavailable.
Information that is not subject to access and is redacted from a public record shall be deemed a
denial.
If a written request for access to a record is denied or deemed denied, the requester may file an
appeal with the State's Office of Open Records within 15 business days of the mailing date of the
Open Records Officer's response or deemed denial.

Supervisors, to assist in the performance of the duties of the Commission.

complaints must be received by the Township Manager or by the Commission within 180 days
of the alleged act of discrimination to be considered timely.
The Township Manager shall convey all original complaints received by that office to the
Chairperson of the Commission within 10 days of the Township's receipt of such complaints.
Notification and answer.
Within 30 days of its receipt of a complaint, the Commission shall:
Send a copy of the complaint to the person(s) charged with a discriminatory practice [the
"respondent(s)"]; and
Send a notice to the person(s) aggrieved, informing them that the complaint has been
received. If the complaint alleges discrimination on a basis proscribed under federal or
state law, the notice sent to the person(s) aggrieved shall also inform them of the right to
file with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and/or with the Federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
The respondent(s) shall file a written verified answer to the complaint within 60 days of receipt
of the complaint. An answer to a complaint may be filed in the same manner as an original
complaint. If the answer is filed at the Newtown Township Building, it shall be conveyed by the
Township Manager to the Chairperson of the Commission within 10 days of the Township's
receipt thereof. The Commission shall promptly send a copy of the answer to the person(s)
aggrieved.
Fact-finding conference.
After the answer has been received (or after 60 days following the filing of the complaint if no
answer is received) the Commission shall, within 60 days, invite the parties to voluntarily
participate in a fact-finding conference concerning the dispute. The parties shall respond to
the invitation to participate in a fact-finding conference within 30 days of being invited to
participate.
If either of the parties agree to participate in a fact-finding conference, the parties shall meet
with one Commission member (who shall be designated by the Chairman of the Commission)
at a location mutually agreeable to the parties within 30 days of the agreement to participate.
Each party will be invited at the fact-finding conference to present evidence and documents
relevant to the complaint. The fact-finding conference will not be a public event, and no record
of the conference will be created, excepting the findings of fact detailed in Subsection 3C.,
below.
The parties shall notify the Commission of whether the fact-finding conference resulted in a
resolution of the complaint. In the event the complaint is resolved, the Commission shall notify
the parties that the complaint has been dismissed. In the event the complaint is not resolved
through the fact-finding conference, then the Commission member with whom the parties met
shall, within 30 days after the meeting, prepare findings of fact and a conclusion as to whether
the Commission member finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an unlawful practice
has occurred.
Disposition of the complaint. Provided that the Commission has not elected under Subsection 5 of
this section to use expanded procedures, and if the complaint is not resolved through the factfinding
conference, the Commission shall, at the next Commission meeting following the factfinding
conference, consider the findings prepared by the Commission member who conducted
the fact-finding conference. The Commission shall accept or reject the findings by public vote. The
Commission shall provide the parties with the findings of fact and conclusions, shall notify the
parties of the outcome of the vote, and the notice shall also indicate that the person aggrieved has
a right to pursue the matter in court by filing a lawsuit.

Option of the Commission to elect for expanded procedures. The Commission shall have the
authority to adopt expanded procedures as set forth in Subsections 6 through 12 of this section,
subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors and appropriation of funding for such procedures.
A majority of Commission members must vote in favor of adopting expanded procedures in order
for such procedures to be adopted. In the event that such procedures are adopted, they must,
while in effect, be applied to all complaints that are not resolved through a fact-finding conference.
If the Commission has adopted expanded procedures, it may also, by majority vote and in its sole
discretion, eliminate such procedures.
Expanded procedures: dismissal or nondismissal of the complaint. If the fact-finding conference
was successful in resolving the complaint, the Commission shall follow the procedures set forth in
Subsection 3C of this section for dismissing the complaint. If the fact-finding conference was not
successful in resolving the complaint, the Commission shall not dismiss the complaint but shall
instead undertake the procedures set out in Subsections 7 through 12 of this section.
Expanded procedures: investigation. The Commission shall, in a timely fashion, investigate the
allegations of discrimination set forth in the complaint. The Commission may, in the conduct of
such investigation, issue subpoenas to any person charged with an unlawful practice to furnish
information, records, or other documents, or to give sworn testimony, as necessary, to assist in its
investigation.
Expanded procedures: finding of no cause. If it shall be determined after the Commission's
investigation that there is no basis for the allegations of the complaint, the Commission shall
cause to be issued and served upon the parties written notice of such determination. This notice
shall inform the person aggrieved that he/she/they has the right to pursue the matter in court by
filing a lawsuit.
Expanded procedures: conciliation. If the Commission, after investigation, determines that the
allegations of the complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the Commission
shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful practice complained of by persuasion,
conference, and conciliation.
Expanded procedures: public hearing.
If the Commission, in its discretion, finds it is not possible to eliminate the unlawful practices
by persuasion, conference, or conciliation, the Commission shall cause to be issued and
served a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, which informs the respondent
that the respondent must answer the charges of such complaint at a public hearing before the
Commission at a time and place to be specified in such notice.
The Commission may designate one or more of its members to preside at such a hearing or it
may, at its election, conduct such hearing en banc.
Both the complainant and the respondent may appear at the hearing with or without counsel
and provide testimony. At the public hearing, the case in support of the complaint may be
presented to the Commission by pro bono counsel, by Commission staff, or by the
complainant's attorney, if the complainant is represented. In addition, both the complainant
and the respondent may introduce the testimony of additional witnesses and may submit
documentary evidence. The Commission and the parties shall not be bound by the strict rules
of evidence at the hearing.
Expanded procedures: finding of unlawful discriminatory practice. If, upon all the evidence at the
hearing, the Commission shall find that a respondent has engaged in or is engaging in any
unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in this Part, the Commission shall state its findings of
fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such
respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such
additional action as the Commission deems appropriate. The Commission shall have the authority

to order any remedies available to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission under the

Expanded procedures: finding of no discrimination. If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the
Commission shall find that a respondent has not engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice,
the Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the
parties an order dismissing the complaint as to such respondent. This order shall inform the
person aggrieved that he/she/they has the right to pursue the matter in court by filing a lawsuit.
§ 1-1607. Private Right of Action and Nonlimitation of Remedies.
[Ord. No. 2018-O-8, 11/28/2018]

Court of Common Pleas or any other court of competent jurisdiction and may recover for each
violation the following remedies:

Pennsylvania Human Relations Act and case law interpreting the same;
Emotional distress damages;
Exemplary damages;

one year from the date of the filing of the complaint. If the person aggrieved has received notice
that the Commission has dismissed the complaint, an action under this section must be brought by
the aggrieved person within one year from the date of receipt of said notice or it will be barred.

citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township does hereby enact as follows.
Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.

[Ord. 2015-O-7, 9/24/2015]
After the issuance of a floodplain permit by the floodplain administrator, no changes of any kind shall
be made to the application, permit or any of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted
with the application without the written consent or approval of the floodplain administrator. Requests for
any such change shall be in writing and shall be submitted by the applicant to the floodplain
administrator for consideration.
§ 8-307. Placards.
[Ord. 2015-O-7, 9/24/2015]
In addition to the floodplain permit, the floodplain administrator shall issue a placard which shall be

§ 8-308. Start of Construction.
[Ord. 2015-O-7, 9/24/2015]
Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180 days after the date of
issuance of the development permit. Work shall also be completed within 12 months after the date
of issuance of the permit or the permit shall expire, unless a time extension is granted, in writing,
by the floodplain administrator. The issuance of a development permit does not refer to the zoning
approval.
The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the floodplain administrator to approve such a request,
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.
§ 8-309. Fees.

Notices. Whenever the floodplain administrator or other authorized municipal representative
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any
provisions of this chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the floodplain
administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
Be in writing;
Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for the performance of any act it
requires;
Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case may require; provided, however,
that such notice or order shall be deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or
agent when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other method authorized
or required by the laws of this commonwealth;
Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or provisions of this
chapter or who fails or refuses to comply with any notice, order or direction of the floodplain
administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality shall be guilty of a summary
offense and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine to Newtown Township of not less than $300 nor
more than $1,000, plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions
are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this chapter. The
imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter shall not
excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons shall be required
to correct or remedy such violations and noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any
development initiated or any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or
relocated in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by the Board of Supervisors to be a
public nuisance and abatable as such. All remedies shall be considered cumulative.
§ 8-311. Appeals.
[Ord. 2015-O-7, 9/24/2015]
Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the floodplain administrator concerning the
administration of the provisions of this chapter may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such
appeal must be filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or action of the
floodplain administrator.
Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the appeal in accordance
with the Municipalities Planning Code[1] and any other applicable local ordinances.

§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas.
[Ord. 2015-O-7, 9/24/2015]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS and the FIRM, which represents
the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without any increase in the water surface elevation at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or
sources of information for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas adjacent to the floodway and identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided but no floodway has been determined.

Whenever a variance is granted, Newtown Township shall notify the applicant, in writing, that:
The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.
Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance from the provisions of this chapter upon a
showing of unnecessary hardship by the applicant and provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship
is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located;
That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that
the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property;
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially and permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare;
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least modification of the regulation in issue;
That the variance, if authorized, will not result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase
in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; and
That the variance, if authorized, will not create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by
Newtown Township. In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall be
included in the annual report to FEMA.
Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be designed and constructed so as
to have the capability of resisting the one-percent annual chance flood.

the spirit of the existing building and/or its environment. In determining the counsel to be
presented to the Newtown Township Board of Supervisors concerning the issuing of a Certificate
of Appropriateness as required by this Part, the HARB shall consider the following:
The exact location of the area in which the work is to be done;
The exterior changes to be made or the exterior character of the structure to be erected;
A list of property owners of the surrounding structures, the appearance of the surrounding
structures preferably as shown through photographs, or a verbal description thereof;
The appropriateness of exterior architectural features including signs which can be seen from
a public street or right-of-way;
The design guidelines outlined in the Commercial Reorganization Study and Development
Guidelines for Newtown Township;
The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation:
Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which
requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use
a property for its originally intended purpose.
The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.
All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time.
Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance
shall be discouraged.
Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and
development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may
have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized
and respected.
Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a
building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever
possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather
than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials
shall not be undertaken.
Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources
affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be
discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical,
architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment.

Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a

essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
The HARB shall not consider any matters not pertinent to the historical aspect and
nature of the District.
Procedure in Counseling for Grant of Certificate of Appropriateness. If the HARB, on the basis of
the information received at the meeting, from the information submitted, and from its general
background and knowledge, decides to advise in favor of granting a Certificate of
Appropriateness, it shall so notify the applicant in writing within five working days of its
recommendation. The HARB will follow the procedures specified in § 106(5).
Procedure in Counseling Against Grant of Certificate of Appropriateness. If the HARB, on the
basis of the information received at the meeting and from its general background and knowledge,
decides to advise against the granting of a Certificate of Appropriateness, it shall so notify the
application in writing within five working days of its recommendation.
Report of HARB Concerning Issuance of Certificate of Appropriateness. The HARB, after following
the procedures set forth in § 106(1) through § 106(4) of this Chapter shall submit to the Newtown
Township Board of Supervisors, in writing, its advice concerning the issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness as required by this Part. The written report shall set out the following matters:
Items listed in § 106(2)(A) through § 106(2)(F);
The opinion of the HARB (including any dissent) as to the appropriateness of the work
proposed as it will preserve or destroy the historic aspect and nature of the district;
The changes in plans or specifications, if any, which in the opinion of the HARB would protect
the distinctive character of the district;
The specific advice of the HARB to issue or to refuse a Certificate of Appropriateness.
In the event the Board of Historical Architectural Review does not act in accordance with § 106(1)
through § 106(5) of this Part, the application shall be referred to the Township Board of
Supervisors without recommendation from the HARB and it shall be presumed by the Township
Board of Supervisors that the application was approved without amendment.

Supervisors.
[Ord. 1985-O-140, 5/6/1985, § 7]
Upon receipt of the written advice of the Board of Historical Architectural Review, the Township Board
of Supervisors shall consider at their next scheduled public meeting or the one thereafter, if the next

days notice by the Township Manager or his/her designee of the time and place of the meeting at
which his/her application will be considered and shall have the right to attend and be heard regarding
his/her application. Within the five working days the applicant has the right to request a change of date
if it is impossible for him/her to attend the meeting proposed by the Township.
In determining whether or not to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Township Board of
Supervisors shall consider, among others, the same factors considered by the Board of Historical
Architectural Review under § 106 of this Part and shall consider the report of the HARB. If the
Township Board of Supervisors approves the application, they shall issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness authorizing the work covered. The Certificate of Appropriateness also authorizes the

complies with all other applicable requirements. If the Township Board of Supervisors disapproves the
application, the decision shall indicate what changes in plans and specifications would meet the
conditions for protecting the distinctive character of the structure, site or area certified to have historical
significance within the district and for protecting the historical environment of the district as a whole.
The Township Board of Supervisors may render its decision at the public meeting. The decision shall
be communicated in writing to the applicant, the Board of Historical Architectural Review, the Building
Inspector, the Zoning Officer and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission within five
days of the decision. In the event the Township Board of Supervisors does not tender its written
decision to the applicant within five days of the date a decision was rendered at a public meeting, it
shall be deemed that the Township Board of Supervisors has decided in favor of the applicant and a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall thereupon be issued. The time limits provided for in this section
may be extended by agreement of the parties in writing.

used in the construction and installation of the system and said standards shall be
incorporated in this Part as fully as though the same were herein set forth at length. Company
shall comply with laws, rules, regulations and specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or
established, including but not limited to, those concerning street work, street excavation, use
and removal and relocation of property within a street.

whenever possible. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled, in
accordance with engineering and safety considerations as mandated by the National
Electrical Code. All installations shall be underground in those areas of the Township where
public utilities providing both telephone and electric service are underground at the time of
installation. In areas where either telephone and electric utility facilities are above ground at
the time of installation, the Grantee may install its service above ground with the
understanding that at such time as those facilities are required to be replaced underground by
the Township, the Grantee shall likewise place its service underground.
Grantee shall not begin any construction, modification, addition, replacement, removal or any
change whatever of any Township facilities except ordinary and necessary repairs, without
filing with the Township a plan of such work and receiving approval from the Township
therefor. Prior to the institution of any work requiring opening, modification or removal of any
Township facilities (including roads), grantee shall enter into a financial security agreement
with the Township providing financial security for the required work and providing for
reimbursement of reasonable engineering and inspection fees, legal fees and administrative
fees, occasioned by a review of the plans, the preparation of the financial security agreement
or otherwise. Such financial security agreement shall be in the sum of 110% of the cost of the
work plus a reasonable provision for engineering, inspection, legal and administrative fees.
Such financial security agreement shall provide that if the work is not completed in a timely
fashion, that the Township may draw down the financial security and complete the work itself
with the total cost thereof being borne by the grantee.
Nothing in this section should be construed as imposing on the Borough the obligation to
review and/or approve the design or construction of the cable system itself or to assure
compliance with any other applicable statutes, ordinances or regulations in connection with
the design or installation of cable television systems, underground or aerial facilities or any
other regulatory obligation imposed by State or Federal government, such obligations being
the sole responsibility of grantee. The purpose of this subsection is to insure restoration of the
property of the Borough and other public property to its prior condition upon completion of the
work and to minimize the impact of the work on the public facilities of this Borough.
The Township specifically reserves the right to vacate any right-of-way they have given
notwithstanding the existence of CATV construction equipment or service lines within any
such right-of-way. In the event any such right-of-way is so vacated the Grantee at its own cost
and expense shall obtain and provide alternate means of providing service to subscribers.

All performance and technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation,
operation, testing, use, maintenance and dismantling of the cable system provided for herein shall
be in accordance with all applicable Federal Communications Commission and other Federal,
State, and Local laws and regulations, provided, however, that the Township may require certain
standards be met by grantee, including, but not limited to the following:
Produce a picture, whether in black and white or in color, that is undistorted, free from ghost
images, and accompanied with proper sound of typical TV production sets.
Transmit signals of adequate strength to produce good pictures with good sound at all outlets
without causing distortion in the cables or interfering with other electrical or electronic systems
or television reception.
Maintain at all times the technical standards provided in the Federal Communications
Commission Regulations, Section 76.604, as currently in effect and as amended, and shall
conduct performance tests as provided in Federal Communications Commission Regulation,
Section 76.601, as currently in effect and as amended. Said tests shall be made available to,
and conducted with such consultants annually and may be required by the Committee if
repeated complaints of picture quality are received. Township to participate in said testing.
Said consultants shall have the right to perform the testing in connection with, or independent
of, testing done by Grantee as required under Federal Communications Commission
Regulations. (The second sentence relating to testing is to be compared with the original draft
and was requested by the grantee so that petty complaints would not cause need for
expensive testing but that testing could be required if complaints of picture quality were
persistent.)
Grantee must provide service response seven days a week for all complaints and requests for
adjustments within 24 hours of receipt of such complaints and requests provided they are
attributable to the cable system. Complaints and requests of all other nature shall be
answered within 48 hours after the complaints. Upon failure to remedy a loss of service
attributable to the cable system within 24 hours after complaint, Grantee shall credit 1/30 of
the regular monthly charge to the subscriber for each 24 hours or fraction thereof, after the
initial 24 hours, until service is restored.
Whenever it is necessary to interrupt service for the purpose of making repairs, adjustments
or installation, Grantee shall do so at such time as will cause the least amount of
inconvenience to subscribers. Unless such interruption is unforeseen and immediately
necessary, it shall give reasonable notice to affected subscribers. The requirements for
maintenance of equipment contained in this provision shall not apply to the subscriber's
television receiver.
§ 13-409. Franchise Fees.
[Ord. 82-O-109, 6/21/1982, § 9]
As compensation for a franchise granted pursuant to this Part, and in consideration of permission
to use the streets and public ways of the Township for the construction, operation, maintenance
and reconstruction of a cable system within the Township, Grantee shall pay annually to the
Township an amount equal to 5% of a Grantee's total local gross revenue from all sources
attributable to the operations of a Grantee within the Township each year of this franchise. In the
event that the Federal law, in the future, permits, any other basis for computing the franchise fee
to be established, such basis, or any part thereof, may be negotiated.
Payments due to Township under this provision shall be computed by the Grantee annually, based
on Grantee's accounting methods. The payment shall be due and payable to the Township no

later than 30 days after the relevant computation date. The payment shall be accompanied by
brief statement verified by the proper officer of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation
and such other relevant facts as may be required by the Township. Failure to comply with this
section shall invoke the penalty procedures as stated in § 403 herein.
No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact,
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim
the Township may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this Part. All
amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the Township. In the event that
recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to the Township, such amount shall be
subject to an interest charge which shall at all times be 2% over and above the prime rate of
interest charged by the Central Penn National Bank to its commercial customers. It is understood
that this adjusted interest rate shall become effective on the first day of the month immediately
following the official notice of such a rate change by the Central Penn National Bank.
In addition to the aforesaid franchise fee, Grantee shall reimburse the Township for its initial cost
for attorneys fees in connection with the establishment of this franchise and reasonable engineers
and consultants fees concerning the establishment of standards in connection with the franchise
and such other reasonable professional fees in the course of modification of the terms of this
franchise as may be necessary from time to time. Grantee shall also be responsible for the
payment of any professional fees where the Township is attempting to, or has attempted to,
enforce the provisions of this Part against Grantee violating the terms and conditions hereof.
§ 13-410. Initial Service and Initial Subscriber Rates.
[Ord. 82-O-109, 6/21/1982, § 10; as amended by Ord. 83-O-120, 5/2/1983, §§ 2 & 3; by Ord. 85-O-
142, 7/1/1985, § 2; and by Ord. 97-O-23, 12/3/1997, § 1(3)]
The Grantee's installation rates for all commercial facilities shall be determined by negotiation
between the Grantee and commercial subscriber.
The Grantee shall not be permitted to charge a converter security deposit fee greater than the
grantee's cost of the converter. In the event the grantee chooses to charge a security deposit fee,
Grantee shall pay to each subscriber, not less than annually, a rate of interest equivalent to that
currently being paid by commercial banks in the Township on passbook savings accounts.
For a period of 24 months from the date of this Part, the initial rates specified in § 410(1) above
shall not be increased except for the following:
Pay TV rates may be increased, from time to time to an amount not in excess of two times the
costs of the monthly program service which is then paid by the Grantee for such service.
The costs of basic service may be increased only by a factor equal to two times the Grantee's
direct cost of acquiring additional programming over and above the programming initially
supplied by grantee to grantee's first customers and an amount equal to two times any
increases in the direct cost of programming which is included within the grantee's initial
service to customers. As used in this paragraph, direct cost of programming only includes the
direct monthly payment by the Grantee to program suppliers.
After twenty-four months from the date of this Part, the grantee shall be permitted to make
increases in the charges for its service without prior approval of the Township Supervisors
provided that such increase shall not be in excess of the following limitations:
Grantee shall be permitted to increase charges for Pay TV so long as the monthly charge to
the customer does not exceed two times the Grantee's direct cost of acquiring such
programming.

The monthly charge for basic service may be increased in an amount not greater than two
times the grantee's direct cost of programming included within the basic service; such
increase to be measured by the direct cots of programming at the time the grantee connects
its initial customers to the month preceding the month during which such increase shall be
effective. In addition, the basic monthly service charge may be increased, from time to time,
by an additional amount provided that such additional increase shall not represent more than
a 10% annual increase (which shall be in addition to the increase permitted by the preceding
provisions of this subparagraph.) The 10% increase shall be determined by combining the
basic monthly charge with the same charge which was made 13 months previously.
In addition to the foregoing increases for Pay TV and basic charge, the Newtown Township
Supervisors may permit additional increases on the basis of what is fair to the consumer and to
the grantee. Such review shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following factors:
Compliance of the operator in abiding by the terms of this Part, the quality of the service,
efficiency of the operator; revenues and profits from all services offered; depreciated original
cost of the cable plant and associated equipment; and a fair rate of return on investments
having corresponding risk.
Approval by the Supervisors of Newtown Township shall be made within 60 days from
application and approval shall be made by resolution of the Board of Supervisors with the
same notice as provided for herein which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The grantee shall not deny, delay, interrupt or terminate cable services or the use of community
access facilities to subscribers or users because a request for an increase in the base rate has
been denied.
Whenever the Township is presented with a request for the grantee to increase Pay TV and/or
basic charges in excess of the automatic increases permitted by this Part, the Township shall
request that the cable operator give notice within 10 days of a public hearing to the general public
between the hours of 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. for seven consecutive days on all activated local
origination access channels of the cable system of where and when the rates to be reviewed may
be examined. Written comments may be filed with the Township and grantee by any person within
30 days from the final date of notice. A written reply to the comments must be filed within 15 days.
The Township shall decide the reasonableness of rates and shall have the right to request from
Grantee such information as may be necessary to determine whether a rate change is reasonable.
The grantee shall annually file with the Township a full schedule of all subscriber and user rates
and all other charges such as, but not limited to, Pay TV, lease channel and discreet services
made in connection with the system. Any special rates for large institutions, motels, multiple-family
dwelling units, or any other type of subscriber shall be included. All rates shall be published and
non-discriminatory.
Nothing in this Part shall prohibit the reduction or waiving of charges in conjunction with
promotional campaigns for the purpose of attracting subscribers or users.
Grantee may require all subscribers to pay for each month of basic service in advance at the
beginning of each month.
There shall be no charge for disconnection of any installation or outlet. If any subscriber fails to
pay a properly due monthly subscriber fee, or any other properly due fee or charge, the Grantee
may disconnect the subscriber's service outlet, providing that the grantee has notified the
subscriber.
If the grantee collects a deposit on any service requested by a subscriber or users, the grantee
shall provide such service within 30 days or refund within the next five days all deposit or advance
charges paid for the service in question by said subscriber to user. This provision does not alter a
grantee's responsibility to subscribers and users under any contractual agreements separate from

this Part the grantee might have the subscribers or users or relieve a grantee of liability for fines
under this Part that may be assessed or damages that might result to the Township or any
subscriber because of a grantee's failure to provide a service promised.
If a subscriber terminates basic service prior to the end of a prepaid period, a pro-rated portion of
any prepaid subscriber service fee, using the number of days as a basis shall be refunded to the
subscriber by a grantee.
Rates charged for additional services shall be consistent with Federal Communications
Commission regulations and in conformance with this Part. In case of a conflict this Part shall
govern unless to do so would cause an unlawful result.
In the event that a resident desires connection and grantee determines that more than 200 feet of
connecting cable is required to be laid across the resident's private property in order to so connect
the resident, then grantee shall provide the additional labor and materials required to connect the
resident in excess of 200 feet at cost to the subscriber.
§ 13-411. Cancellation or Termination of Franchise; Default by
Grantee.
[Ord. 82-O-109, 6/21/1982, § 11]
Grantee shall complete construction of Cable TV Distribution System within the twelve-month time
period as defined in § 406(1) above. The system shall be deemed completed when the head-end
is installed and all of the trunk lines shown on the plan dated the 1st day of June 1982,
incorporated herein by reference are installed and energized. In order to insure diligent
performance of this obligation hereunder, the Grantee shall provide quarterly written progress
reports to the Township Supervisors, which progress reports shall include an estimated completion
date for the system. In the event the grantee shall have been diligent during the 12 month period,
the grantee shall be entitled to an automatic grace period, the system shall still not be completed,
the Township (unless further grace period is granted) reserves the right to terminate and cancel
the franchise hereby granted and all the rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder in
accordance with the following procedures:
The Township shall notify the grantee in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, of
the alleged default. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to the receipt of the notice to
cure the violation(s).
If the grantee does not respond or, upon receipt of the grantee's response and/or evidence of
correction of the violation, if the Township concludes that a basis for termination still exists, it
shall notify the grantee thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, and indicate the
date on which a public hearing shall be held pursuant to 10 days public notice in a newspaper
of general circulation.
At that public hearing, the grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to explain the reasons for
the alleged violation(s). Upon conclusion thereof, the Township may terminate the franchise or
direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and
conditions as the Township may direct.
If this franchise is terminated in accordance with the foregoing procedures, that part of the
system then installed shall become the property of the Township for a price or consideration
equal to the costs of the system then installed. For this purpose, cost shall include direct costs
of labor and material excluding any interest or management fees or salaries. If such
determination of costs cannot be agreed upon, then each party shall select an appraiser and
such appraiser shall select a third appraiser. The amount to be paid shall be equal to 50% of
the sum of the two appraisers that are closest to each other.

Township shall purchase the entire system for fair market value. Such fair market value shall be
the fair market value of all tangible and intangible property forming part of the system as a going
business. If the Township fails to purchase the system within 90 days after such non-renewal of
the franchise (during which time the grantee may continue to exercise the franchise) the Township
shall either renew the franchise or permit the grantee to arrange a purchase of the system by any
other party subject to approval of such party by the Township Supervisors, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld, which purchaser shall receive a renewed franchise.
Prior to commencement of installation of any part of the system, grantee shall deliver to the
Township Supervisors a written instrument duly executed by the grantee containing the following
provisions:
That the grantee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Part and faithfully to perform its
obligations hereunder.
That it consents to the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, to grant orders specifically enforcing the provisions of this Part against the
grantee.

The Township may order the grantee to restore the streets to a condition the same as existed prior to
System construction excluding any improvements made to said streets subsequent to System
construction. The Township Engineer shall cause such streets to be examined prior to any construction
by the Grantee and shall provide a report on the condition of such street to the Township and the
Grantee. With regard to non-public property, the Grantee shall restore such property to a condition the

sufficiency.
The Township shall proceed to determine at a public hearing whether the Grantee has
satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise after giving 10 days public notice, in a
newspaper of general circulation, including notification to the grantee. To determine satisfactory
performance, the Township shall review technical developments and performance of this system,
programming, additional services offered, costs of service, fiscal and customer relations and
technical audits, and any other particular requirement that may be set forth in this Part.
Following the review set forth in § 412(2) of this section, the Township may elect (i) to award
grantee a five-year term franchise extension pursuant to the terms and conditions of § 403 of this
Part, as amended; or (ii) purchase the System; or (iii) permit the purchase of the system by
another party; or (iv) permit the franchise to expire.

dwelling, upon request of the resident.
Each class of subscriber service shall be offered cable television service on a uniform, nondiscriminatory
basis within said class.

The system shall be designed for reliable operation 24 hours per day and shall ensure service

There shall be no charge to the subscriber for this service. The Grantee shall maintain a
record on the disposition of all complaints and/or requests for repairs and shall provide an
annual summary to the Township within 30 days of the anniversary date of the awarding of
the franchise.
Said record shall be available for inspection upon reasonable notice, but in no case less than
four times annually.
The grantee shall not deny nor delay service, deny or delay access, or otherwise discriminate
against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on any basis whatsoever.

Federal Communications Commission as expressed in Section 76.13(a)(8) and 73.311 of
Chapter I, Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all Federal, State and local laws,

action programs and nondiscrimination.
The grantee shall comply with all provisions of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act as the

tabulation, which would reveal the commercial product preferences or opinions of subscribers,
members of their families or their invitees, licensees or employees without the express written
consent of each and every subscriber so polled or tabulated.
In all cases where developments and subdivisions are to be constructed and to be served in whole
or in part by underground power and telephone utilities, and in such area where both utilities are to
be placed underground, exclusive of all electronic cable television facilities, the grantee shall
similarly comply and shall install system concurrently with the installation of the underground
power and telephone utilities.
Upon the reasonable request for service by any person within the Township, the grantee shall,
within 30 days, furnish the requested service to said person providing the location of the requested
service is within an area serviced by a feeder line.
If a subscriber requests installation or extension of cable and grantee fails to install or extend it
within three months 90 days after the system is completed, such a failure shall be considered a
breach of a condition of this Part. Continuing failure to install and/or extend cable system service
during any subsequent three months 90 days period shall constitute a separate breach of a
condition of this Part, provided, however, that there shall be no obligation to extend service more
than 200 feet from existing cable to a subscriber without the subscriber's contribution to the cost of
such extension. (This request we felt was reasonable under all the circumstances.)
Any subscriber who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television service, equipment
malfunctions, buildings, or any other matter which remains unresolved for 30 days after it has
been brought to the grantee's attention, in writing, may file a compliant in writing with the Township
who shall have the primary responsibility for the continuing administration of complaint procedure
hereunder.

application in conformity with FCC rules. Only the cable operator(s) may decide whether
to submit a cost-of-service rate application.
The cable operator shall give written notice to its subscribers that a rate application has been
filed at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any proposed rate increase. In the case of
an annual rate adjustment rate application, the cable operator may give subscribers notice of
the proposed rate changes at the time a cable operator files its rates with the franchising
authority. Such notice should state that the proposed rate change is subject to approval by the
franchising authority. If the cable operator is only permitted a smaller increase than was
provided for in the notice, the cable operator must provide an explanation to subscribers on
the bill in which the rate adjustment is implemented. If the cable operator is not permitted to
implement any of the rate increase that was provided for in the notice, the cable operator
must provide an explanation to subscribers within 60 days of the date of the franchising
authority's opinion. Said notice shall provide the name and address of the franchising
authority before whom the rate application is pending.
The cable operator(s) bears the burden of proof that its current rate or any proposed rate
increase complies with the statutes of the United States and the regulations of the FCC.

Within 10 days of receipt of a rate application, the franchising authority shall provide notice in
a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which
notice shall contain at a minimum:
The rate application has been received from the cable operator(s).
The manner in which interested parties may review and/or obtain copies of the rate
application.
The effective date of the proposed rate increase if that is the subject of the rate
application.
The manner in which interested parties may offer their comments regarding the rate
application.
The date all comments must be received by the franchising authority.
The date on which the franchising authority must act on the rate application or the rate
application shall have become effective without action.
Within 30 days of receipt of the rate application, other than an annual rate adjustment, the
franchising authority shall:
Review the rate application and documentation submitted by the cable operator(s).
Compare the current rates or the proposed rate increase submitted by the cable
operator(s) with the maximum permitted rates or with such other applicable standards as
have been adopted and/or approved by the FCC.
Consider any public input on the rate application which may have been provided.
Approve, disapprove or seek additional time to consider the rate application.
In the event the cable operator files an annual rate adjustment, the franchising authority shall

Review the rate application and documentation submitted by the cable operator(s).
Compare the current rates or the proposed rate increase submitted by the cable
operator(s) with the maximum permitted rates or with such other applicable standards as

Consider any public input on the rate application which may have been provided.
Approve, disapprove or seek additional time to consider the rate application.
However, if the franchising authority or its designee concludes that the cable operator
has submitted a facially incomplete filing, the franchising authority's deadline for issuing
an opinion, the date on which rates may go into effect if no opinion is issued and the
period for which refunds are payable will be tolled while the franchising authority is
waiting for this information; provided, that in order to toll these effective dates the
franchising authority or its designee notifies the cable operator of the incomplete filing
within 45 days of the date the filing is made.
Deemed Approval.
If the franchising authority shall fail to either approve, disapprove or seek additional time
to consider the rate application, other than an annual rate adjustment, within said 30
days, the rate application shall be deemed approved on the thirtieth day after submission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Part 4B, in the event the cable
operator files an annual rate adjustment, if the franchising authority has taken no action
within the ninety-day review period, then the proposed rates may go into effect at the end
of the review period, subject to a prospective rate reduction and refund if the franchising
authority subsequently issues an opinion disapproving any portion of such rates;
provided, however, that in order to order a prospective rate reduction and refund, if the
cable operator who made the filing inquires as to whether the franchising authority
intends to issue an opinion after the initial review period, the franchising authority or its
designees must notify the cable operator of its intent in this regard within 15 days of the
cable operator's inquiry. If a proposed rate goes into effect before the franchising
authority issues its opinion, the franchising authority shall have 12 months from the date
the cable operator filed for the rate adjustment to issue its opinion. In the event that the
franchising authority does not act within this twelve-month period, it may not at a later
date order a refund or a prospective rate reduction with respect to that rate filing.
Request for Additional Time.
Rate Application. If the franchising authority is unable to determine from the rate application,
including any supporting documentation submitted by the cable operator(s), whether the
current rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation necessary to
receive the basic service tier and/or the proposed rate increase are within the maximum
permitted rates, the franchising authority may, in cases not involving an annual rate
adjustment or cost-of-service showings, take an additional 90 days to consider the rate
application.
The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the same upon the cable
operator(s) indicating that additional time is required to consider the rate application. The
order shall be issued prior to the expiration of the 30 days during which the franchising
authority may consider the rate application. Within seven days of issuance of such order,
the franchising authority shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation within
the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice shall contain a summary of the
order, including the additional time requested and the reason for requesting such
additional time.
The cable operator may submit such additional information as it believes will cure any
deficiencies in the rate application during the additional time.
The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to furnish additional specified
information, including proprietary information, when the current rate or proposed rate
increase is in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current rate is equal to or
below the maximum permitted rate the franchising authority may only require furnishing
of documentation that the rate is within the maximum permitted rate. Any proprietary
information furnished to the franchising authority shall be retained as confidential in
conformity with regulations adopted by the FCC in this regard, a copy of which
regulations are on file with and available for review upon request to the franchising
authority.
If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the expiration of the additional time,
the current rates or proposed rate increase shall become effective, subject to any later
refund order adopted by the franchising authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
franchising authority, in order to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order,
direct the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by
reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
Cost of Service Rate Application. If the cable operator(s) has submitted a cost-of-service rate
application and the franchising authority is unable to determine whether the current rates for
the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation necessary to receive the basic
service tier and/or the proposed rate increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the

franchising authority may take an additional 150 days to consider the cost of service rate
application.
The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the same upon the cable
operator(s) indicating that additional time is required to consider the rate application
because it is a cost-of-service rate application. The order shall be issued prior to the
expiration of the 30 days during which the franchising authority may consider the rate
application. Within seven days of issuance of such order the franchising authority shall
publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the
franchising authority, which notice shall contain a summary of the order including the
additional time requested and the reason for requesting such additional time.
The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to furnish additional specified
information, including proprietary information, when the current rate or proposed rate
increase is in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current rate is equal to or
below the maximum permitted rate, the franchising authority may only require furnishing
of documentation that the rate is within the maximum permitted rate. Any proprietary
information furnished to the franchising authority shall be retained as confidential in
conformity with regulations adopted by the FCC in this regard, a copy of which
regulations are on file with and available for review upon request to the franchising
authority.
If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the expiration of the additional time,
the current rates or proposed rate increase shall become effective, subject to any later
refund order adopted by the franchising authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
franchising authority, in order to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order,
direct the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by
reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
Decision of the Franchising Authority.
The franchising authority shall issue a written opinion when:
The rate application is not approved, in whole or in part, by the franchising authority.
The rate application is approved by the franchising authority over the objection(s) of any
interested party.
The franchising authority may, but is not required to, issue a written opinion when the rate
application is approved and there have been no objections filed.
Within seven days of issuance of an opinion, the franchising authority shall provide notice in a
newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which
notice shall contain at a minimum that:
The franchising authority has reached a decision on the rate application and announcing
that decision.
The manner in which interested parties may review and/or obtain copies of the opinion.
The right of interested parties to take an appeal from the opinion of the franchising
authority.
The deadline for taking any such appeal.
Notice of the opinion of the franchising authority shall be provided to the cable operator(s) by

Rate Reduction.
Current Rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an opinion disapproving the current
rates of the cable operator(s) for the basic service tier or for rates for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier, the franchising authority may order
a reduction in the current rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier. The prospective rate adjustment
may be set at:
A level consistent with the FCC adopted maximum permitted rates.
Another rate based on review of a cost-of-service rate application.
Another rate consistent with FCC rules.
Proposed Rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an opinion disapproving of any
proposed rate increase the franchising authority may:
Prescribe a reasonable rate to be charged by the cable operator(s) instead of the
proposed rate. The prescribed rate may not be lower that the maximum permitted
rate unless a cost-of-service rate application has been submitted by the cable
operator(s) and the franchising authority determines that the cost-of-service analysis
justifies a lower rate.
Advise the cable operator(s) of a rate level to which it would not object if a modified
rate application were resubmitted.
Refunds. The franchising authority may order a refund if:
The cable operator failed to comply with a rate decision by the franchising authority. The
refund period may be retroactive to the effective date of the rate order issued by the
franchising authority.
The franchising authority determines in its initial review of the current rates that they
exceed the maximum permitted rates and are unsupported by a cost-of-service rate
application. In such instance the refund period may be retroactive to September 1, 1993,
or one year prior to the date on which the cable operator(s) implement(s) the prospective
rate adjustment, whichever is shorter.
The franchising authority:
Has issued an order permitting it to take an additional 90 or 150 days to consider a
rate application.
Has directed the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were
paid; but
Failed to issue an opinion during that time period, causing the rates to become
provisionally effective and the franchising authority later finds all or a portion of the
rates to be unreasonable. In such instance, the refund period may be retroactive to
the date of the order and ending on the date on which the cable operator(s)
implements the prospective rate reduction or one year, whichever is shorter.
Before any refund order shall become effective, the franchising authority must send notice to
the cable operator(s) and provide said cable operator(s) a maximum of 30 days to submit
additional information to the franchising authority as to why the refund should not be ordered.
At the end of said period the franchising authority shall either confirm, amend or rescind said
refund order.

Part 6. SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
§ 13-601. Purpose and Findings.
[Ord. 2000-7, 10/25/2000, § 601]
Purpose.
Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township Code to prohibit nuisances;
to promote the health, welfare, cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of Newtown
Township; and to regulate the time of opening and closing, and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township of Newtown enacts this Part to
minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and
thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of
surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of blight.
The Board of Supervisors has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means
of accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with
reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their
establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
The Board of Supervisors does not intend this Part to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but intends to enact a content neutral ordinance which
addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.
Legislative Findings. The Board of Supervisors finds:
Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which should be regulated to
protect the public health, safety and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are not
limited to the spread of communicable diseases, performance of sexual acts in public places,
presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual activities, crime and neighborhood
deterioration.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the
operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the
health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
Township. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and
activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidents of certain types of

(2)
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-today
operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control
the adverse secondary effects of such businesses.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited
amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which
this Part is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in
that conduct in contravention of this Part.
The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a
period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission
of sexually transmitted diseases.
The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the Township will be promoted by the
enactment of this Part.
Limitation of operating hours sexually oriented businesses to 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.,
Mondays through Saturdays, and closure of such businesses on Sunday and holidays
reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly, but not
limited to late night noise levels, crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public
areas, and promotes the public health, safety and welfare.

[Ord. 2000-7, 10/25/2000, § 609]
The Township Code Enforcement Officer shall revoke a license if a cause of suspension in § 608

A licensee is delinquent in payment to the Township for any licensing fees past due.
When the Township revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one year, and the licensee

Township Manager within 10 days from the date of mailing of the decision appealed from. Failure

decision appealed from shall be deemed a conclusive determination as to the issues or matters
addressed by the written decision. In the case of a denial of a license renewal, or in the case of a
license suspension or revocation, the licensee may continue to operate to the same extent as
immediately prior to the suspension or revocation until the earlier of (A) the expiration of the tenday
appeal period without filing of an appeal or (B) the date of a decision dismissing any appeal.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Township Board of Supervisors may appeal to a court
of competent jurisdiction. The Township shall, upon filing of such appeal, consent to any request
by a license applicant or licensee to the court to give expedited review to such appeal. The
Township shall certify any record to the court within 20 days of any request by the court to do so.

Statement of Findings. The Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township finds that:
Inadequate management of community on-lot wastewater disposal systems increases surface
water pollution, groundwater contamination, the potential of public health problems, and
general nuisance conditions.
A comprehensive and reasonable program of community on-lot disposal system (OLDS)
management regulations is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and to the
protection of present and future residents and the environment of Newtown Township.
Purpose. The purpose of this Part is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by
minimizing the problems described in subsection (2)(A) of this section by:
Review of community OLDS plans for conformance with the Township's official wastewater
facilities plan and ordinances.
Giving force and effect to the policies adopted in the official Act 537 Plan of Newtown
Township.
Adoption; Authority; Applicability. The Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township, Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, pursuant to the Clean Streams Law of Pennsylvania (Act 394 of June 22, 1937, P.L.
1987, as amended), the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 537, of January 24, 1966, P.L.
1535, as amended, 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq.), the Second Class Township Code (53 P.S. §§ 65727,
65729 and 66951), and the rules and regulations of the Department of Environmental Resources
adopted pursuant to the aforementioned statutes, hereby enacts and ordains this Part as the
Newtown Township Community On-Lot Disposal System (OLDS) Management Ordinance. This
Part shall apply to all community on-lot sewage systems as defined in § 302 of this Part. No part of
this Part shall preempt the functions, duties and jurisdiction of the Bucks County Department of
Health (BCDH) with respect to the enforcement of Act 537, the Clean Streams Law or BCDH rules
and regulations for OLDS.
Right-of-Entry. After giving adequate notice and upon presentation of proper credentials, the Code
Enforcement Officer of Newtown Township may enter at reasonable times upon any property
within the Township to investigate or ascertain the condition of the subject property in regard to
any aspect regulated by this Part.
Repealer. Any ordinance of Newtown Township inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Part
is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Severability. Should any Section or provision of this Part be declared invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions
of this Part or of the provisions of the Code of Ordinances of Newtown Township.
Compatibility With Other Permits and Ordinances. Permits issued pursuant to this Part do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
Township Liability. The degree of community on-lot disposal system (OLDS) management sought
by the provisions of this Part is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. The issuance of
permits by Newtown Township, its officer or employees, shall not be deemed to relieve the
developer or the owner of responsibility, if any such responsibility exists, to those adversely
affected by the on-lot disposal of sewage. Further, the Township through the issuance of a permit
assumes no responsibility to either the developer, the owner or any adjoining property owner
affected by the on-lot disposal of sewage.

The owner shall have 60 days from receipt of the notice of required pumping to have the
system pumped and inspected; provided, however, that aerobic systems need not be
pumped. Aerobic systems only require inspection.
The following procedures shall be utilized in pumping and inspecting an on-lot disposal
system utilizing a septic tank as a primary unit:
Locate the septic tank and the effluent disposal area (tile field trenches, seepage
bed, seepage pits, elevated sand mound, etc.).
Locate the septic tank cleanout manhole and excavate around the cover to prevent
soil from falling into the tank when the cover is removed. The owner shall be
responsible to have the clean-out manhole excavated, whether by the sewage
hauler or otherwise.
Remove cleanout manhole cover. Break up scum in the tank and pump out a portion
of the material in the tank. Do not pump out of the inspection port over the baffle as
this may damage the baffle and will not permit the tank contents to be thoroughly
mixed for pumping.
Reinject the pumped liquid back into the tank to further break up the scum and mix
the sludge at the bottom of the tank with the liquid. Pump out the mixed material.
Repeat subsection (d) until the tank can be completely pumped out, i.e., all sludge
and scum removed.
With the tank empty, inspect the tank for cracks, leaks, deterioration and missing
baffles. Do not go into tank to make the inspection. A mirror and light may be helpful
to see inside the tank. Note any problems with the tank. Do not clean the tank with
acid or chemical cleaner.
Replace the manhole cover carefully and securely.
If the tank is buried deeper than a foot or two, it is suggested that risers be installed
over the cleanout manhole and inspection port to facilitate future cleaning and
inspection. The riser over the cleanout manhole should be at least four inches in
diameter.
Backfill over the cover or around the riser.
Make a visual inspection of the disposal area for seepage, breakouts, etc., and note
any problems.
Inform the owner of any problems encountered with any of the components of the
system and, if possible, suggest corrective measures.
Clean up any spillage. Dispose of the septage at any approved disposal site.
Aerobic systems shall not be pumped but shall be inspected by a qualified person to
determine that they are in good working order.
The pumping and inspection notice, signed by the sewage hauler or, in the case of an
aerobic system, by the inspector, shall be returned to the Township by the owner together
with a fee which will be set by resolution of the Township Board of Supervisors.

Waiver and Appeal Procedure.
The provisions of this Part are intended as minimum standards of the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare. The Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township may grant a
waiver from literal compliance with mandatory provisions of this Part; provided, that the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
That compliance would cause unnecessary hardship, excluding economic hardship, as it
applies to particular property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
That an alternative proposal will allow for equal or better results.
Additionally, the Board of Supervisors may hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that
the Code Enforcement Officer has failed to follow prescribed procedures or has
misinterpreted or misapplied any provision of this Part.
The approval of a waiver or appeal shall not have the effect of making null and void the intent
and purpose of this Part. In the approval of a waiver or appeal, the Board of Supervisors may
impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards and requirements of this Part. This Section of this Part shall in no way preempt the
authority of the Bucks County Department of Health or the PA DER.
Application Procedure (Waiver/Appeal). All requests for waivers or appeals shall be
processed in accordance with the following:
A request for a waiver or appeal shall be submitted to the Township Manager. The
request shall be made in writing and identify (1) the specific section of the ordinance
or decision which is requested for waiver or appeal, (2) the proposed alternative to
the requirement, when applicable, and (3) justifications for an approval of the waiver
of appeal.
The applicant shall deposit a sum of money in an escrow account when submitting a
request for a waiver or appeal. The amount shall be set by separate ordinance and
is subject to change upon resolution by the Board of Supervisors. In addition, the
Board may waive or reduce initial escrow amounts. Furthermore, the applicant shall
reimburse Newtown Township for all reasonable professional expenses in excess of
the escrow accounts that are incurred during the waiver and appeal procedure.

The Township Manager shall (1) schedule the request for consideration by the Board
of Supervisors at a public meeting within 45 days of receipt and (2) provide adequate
notice to the applicant, the sanitary officer and any other involved parties of the
meeting at which consideration of the request is scheduled.
The Board of Supervisors shall, following the consideration of the request, take such
public action as it shall deem advisable no later than its next regulatory scheduled
public meeting. Such action shall cite the findings and reasons for the deposition of
the waiver or appeal. Failure of the Board of Super-visors to render a decision and
communicate it as prescribed above shall be deemed an approval unless the time
period is extended by the applicant.
Expiration of a Community OLDS Management Permit. An on-lot disposal system management
permit shall expire if the system remains unused for a period of two years or more.
Transfer of OLDS Management Permits. The transfer of a property subject to an OLDS permit
shall require the transferor supply the transferee with a written statement that the OLDS is in
compliance with the OLDS ordinance. If the transferor is not in compliance, the transferor shall
come into compliance before the property is transferred. In addition, the transferor shall supply the
transferee with a legible plan of the location and design of the well serving the property and OLDS
if any, on the property being transferred. Finally, the transferor shall promptly notify the Code
Enforcement Officer of the full name(s) and address of the transferee and the officer shall transfer
the existing OLDS permit to the transferee, subject to its terms and conditions and inspection
schedule.
Construction Escrow/Performance Bond.
Construction Escrow.
The property owner or developer shall file with the Newtown Township Board of
Supervisors a financial security. The purpose of such a construction escrow shall be that
the Township may effect repairs to the OLDS or replacement of the OLDS as may be
necessary until construction is completed and the system is functioning to the satisfaction
of the Township Engineer.
Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the Township may approve,
such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Federal or Commonwealth chartered
lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts shall be
deemed acceptable financial security. Such financial security shall be posted with a
bonding company or Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by
the developer, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to
conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
The amount of the construction escrow shall be as follows:
For all community OLDS, the construction escrow shall be 110% of the estimated
construction cost. The cost of the facilities shall be established by submission to the
Board of Supervisors a bona fide bid or bids from the contractor or contractors
chosen by the developer or property owner to complete the facilities, or in the
absence of such bona fide bids, the cost shall be established by estimates prepared
by the Township Engineer. If the developer requires more than one year from the
date of posting of the financial security to complete the required facilities, the amount
of financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for one-year period
beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required facilities as reestablished
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above
bidding.

Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Fund. The Township shall require, prior to issuance of an
OLDS permit for all community OLDS, a cash deposit in sufficient funds to ensure continued
operation and maintenance of the system. The funds shall be of an amount to guarantee an
annual return, assuming a 5% invested rate of return, equal to the estimated annual O&M
expenses as determined by the Township Engineer. The O&M fund shall also include a 10%
increase for the purpose of creating additional revenue for capital improvements, as may be
required during the lifetime of the system. All unused annual funds shall be reinvested into the
account to supplement the original fund to accommodate unusual circumstances requiring a
funding source.

Civil Remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation engaged in the construction of a community on-lot
disposal system (OLDS) (as defined in § 302 of this Part) or involved in the installation,
operation and/or maintenance of any or all components of an OLDS, shall implement such
activities consistent with the OLDS permit and this Part. Any such activity conducted in
violation of this Part or the OLDS permit is hereby declared a public nuisance.
In the event of a violation, the Newtown Township Board of Supervisors may institute suits to
restrain, prevent or abate a violation of this Part. A suit may be instituted in equity or at law by
the Newtown Township Board of Supervisors. Such proceedings in equity or law may be
cases of emergency where, in the opinion of the court, the unlawful conduct, the court may, in
its decree, fix a reasonable time during which the person responsible for the expense of such
proceedings shall be recoverable from the violator in such manner as may now or hereafter
be provided by law.
Penalties.
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this Part, or who shall fail to
comply with any written notice from Newtown Township which describes a condition of
noncompliance, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a district justice in the
manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than
$1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each Section of this
Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
In addition, the Township may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action
or proceeding of law or in equity for the enforcement of this Part. Any court of competent
jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent
injunctions, writs of mandamus or other appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

Code Enforcement Officer may appeal to the Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township within

§ 18-502. Applicability.
[Ord. 2012-O-5, 8/22/2012, § 1]
Wastewater that contains FOG shall be discharged into the sewer system only under the
conditions of this Part. The following facilities shall discharge all wastewater from sinks,
dishwashers, drains, and any other fixtures through which grease may be discharged, into an
adequately sized, properly maintained and functioning grease interceptor before the discharge
enters the sewer system:
Every commercial food establishment.
All food courts.
All other generators discharging grease in amounts that, in the opinion of an authorized
agent, will, alone or in concert with other substances from the discharges of other facilities,
have a reasonable chance to impede or stop the flow of the sewer system.
All areas of intensified dwelling, including, but not limited to, adult day care facilities, assisted living
facilities, convalescent homes, day nursing and child care facilities, in which food preparation
occurs, homes for the mentally challenged, hotels, maternity homes, motels in which there is a

shall be made based upon an investigation of the property, and a comparison of the content and
amount of discharge from the property with the discharges of other properties similar in size and
use. Upon a determination that the discharges will create problems in the sewer system, the
authorized agent may require the installation of a sufficiently sized grease interceptor to treat the
discharges.
§ 18-503. Compliance Date.
[Ord. 2012-O-5, 8/22/2012, § 1]
On or after the effective date of this Part, an existing facility shall be required to install an
approved, adequately sized, and properly operated and maintained grease interceptor when any
of the following conditions exist:
It is found by an authorized agent to be contributing grease in quantities sufficient to cause
sewer line stoppages or necessitate increased maintenance on the sewer system in order to
keep main line stoppages from occurring.
It is remodeling the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing facilities in such a manner to
be subject to a license.
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
Its grease interceptor allows a discharge of oil and grease in excess of 100 milligrams per liter
(mg/l) and the generator does not perform best management practices.
Existing facilities required by this or other applicable ordinances to maintain a grease interceptor
and that are not equipped with a grease interceptor or are equipped with an undersized grease
interceptor shall, within 180 days of the effective date of this Part, install an adequately sized
grease interceptor in accordance with the specifications of this Part.
If the Township's authorized agent (Authority) determines that there is a need for installation or
upgrading of a grease interceptor on an existing facility, the Authority may order the installation or
upgrading of such interceptors. If the Authority orders such installation or upgrade, then the
Authority shall serve notice by registered or certified mail upon the owner of such premises. The
owner may request and shall be granted a hearing before the Authority. Such hearing shall be
requested by filing a petition, in writing, stating the grounds of the petition within five days after
notice of the authorized agent's decision and paying an administration fee in an amount as
established from time to time by resolution of the Authority. The hearing shall commence within 30
days of filing of the petition unless postponed for good cause. After such hearing the Authority
shall sustain, modify or overrule the action of the authorized agent.
The Authority may waive the requirement for a grease interceptor provided the generator can
verify that only domestic wastewater is being discharged. The Authority may require testing by the
generator in connection with this request, with all costs for this testing being the generator's
expense.
New facilities required by this or other applicable ordinances to maintain a grease interceptor shall
install such a unit prior to commencement of discharge to the sewer system.
On or after the effective date of this Part, any existing facility or new facility that is required to
utilize a grease interceptor must obtain a FOG license from the Authority.

The following prohibitions shall apply:
Where FOG are a by-product of food preparation and/or cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be
made to separate waste oil and grease into a separate container for proper disposal and not
to discharge such FOG into any drains or grease interceptors. In no event shall waste oil or
grease be directly discharged into any drains or grease interceptors. Such waste must be
placed in a container designed to hold such waste and disposed of at a suitable location.
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease interceptor, or into any
drain that leads to the grease interceptor:
Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes, degreasers, or any type of
product that will liquefy grease interceptor wastes.
Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the sewer system.
Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid contents of the grease
interceptor to the sewer system.
Illegal discharge items, such as hazardous wastes including, but not limited to, acids,
strong cleaners, pesticides, herbicides, paint, solvents, or gasoline.
Use of grease interceptor treatment products, including bacteria designed to digest
grease, is specifically prohibited without prior written consent of the Authority.
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
Acceptance of such products for use may be considered only where a valid
screening test, showing the product's ability to treat wastewater and to produce an
effluent in compliance with this Part, has been performed in accordance with
methods outlined and approved by the Authority.
If a product is approved, each generator must obtain written permission from the
Authority to use each proposed product.
The influent to grease interceptors shall not exceed 140° F. The temperature at the flow
control device inspection port shall be considered equivalent to the temperature of the
influent.
Toilets, urinals, and other similar fixtures shall not discharge through a grease interceptor.
All waste shall only enter the grease interceptor through the inlet flow control device, then the
inlet pipe.
Where food-waste grinders are installed in a nonresidential establishment, the waste from
those units shall discharge directly into the building drainage system without passing through
a grease interceptor.
The concentration of FOG that can be discharged to the sewer system shall not exceed 100
mg/l if the generator does not perform best management practices.
§ 18-505. Requirements for Grease Interceptors.

Provide an adequately sized and properly constructed grease interceptor.
Maintain backup copies of manifests and service logs, on the premises of the existing facility,
for at least five years.
Generators are responsible for maintaining grease interceptors in continuous proper working
condition. Further, generators are responsible for inspecting, repairing, replacing, or installing
apparatus and equipment as necessary to ensure proper operation and function of grease
interceptors and compliance with discharge limitations at all times.
Allow inspection of the facility and records by authorized agents during reasonable hours.
Grease Interceptor Sizing and Design Criteria.
Size, type, and location of grease interceptors shall be as provided in the manufacturer's
instructions and/or in accordance with any other applicable provision of the then-current
Pennsylvania UCC Plumbing Code or as provided under Authority regulation, as determined
by the Authority.
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
Applicability. These requirements are applicable to all commercial food establishments,
including those that are undergoing:
New construction.
Interior remodeling to accommodate expansion or operational modifications.
Changes of ownership/occupancy.
Existing facilities that may be experiencing difficulty in achieving compliance with
maintenance and/or wastewater discharge limitations.
Sizing Requirements. Sizing methods described herein are intended as guidance in
determining grease interceptor sizes that will afford the Authority's sewer system a minimum
degree of protection against grease and other obstructing materials. In approving a
customer's plumbing or grease interceptor design, the Authority does not accept liability for
the failure of a system to adequately treat wastewater to achieve effluent quality requirements
specified under this Part. It is the responsibility of the generator to insure the appropriate level
of treatment necessary for compliance with environmental and wastewater regulations.
Minimum acceptable grease interceptor sizing shall be accomplished as follows:
Sizing according to formulas found in paragraph D below.
Under no circumstances should exterior grease interceptors less than 750 gallons be
utilized. Where sizing formulas result in determination of a grease interceptor less than
750 gallons in capacity, this minimum size is required.
In the circumstance of "single service kitchens" with no food preparation (heat/serve
only), and which use only paper service items, a minimum 50 gallon per minute (gpm)
flow rated, or 100 pound grease retention, mechanical grease interceptors may be used.
In these instances, the grease interceptor is to be installed in an area separate from the
food handling area, and the grease interceptor must be readily accessible for cleaning
and maintenance.
Grease Interceptor Sizing Formulas. It is the responsibility of the generator to ensure that his
wastewater discharge is in compliance with the Authority's discharge limitations. For the
purpose of plan review, a general assessment of grease interceptor design and size will be
performed using the following formulas, which are recommended by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency for grease interceptor sizing:

Method 1: EPA Grease Interceptor Sizing Formula. Taken from Chapter 8 of EPA's October
1980 design manual, On-site Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems. Document
number EPA 625/1-80-012.
Method 7: As provided in the then-current provisions of the Pennsylvania UCC Plumbing
Code. [Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
Method 3: Alternate Sizing Formulas/Proposals. Facilities that propose the use of alternate
sizing techniques and/or procedures that result in specifications that differ from calculated
requirements must submit formulas and other bases to support proposed grease interceptor
size/installation. Submission should also provide documentation of the ability to meet effluent
quality requirements. This proposal must be signed by a licensed plumbing contractor or
engineer licensed in the State of Pennsylvania.
Installation. All licensing, construction, and inspection activities must be completed in
accordance with the current applicable plumbing codes. Additionally, the following
specifications must be incorporated into grease interceptor design:
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
The grease interceptor shall be constructed with a minimum of two chambers or shall
have a minimum of two tanks in series. If two chambered, the dividing wall must extend
to within one foot of the bottom of the tank and within two inches of the top and be
securely fastened to both sides.
There must be inlet and outlet tees installed; made of schedule cast iron. The inlet tee
should extend down approximately one-third the depth of the grease interceptor from the
top and the outlet tee should be located 12 to 18 inches off of the bottom of the grease
interceptor. Inability to visually inspect tees during cleanout of the interceptor will require
entry into the interceptor at least once every five years.
Piping inside of the grease interceptor must be ductile iron with stainless steel
straps/supports if needed.
Grease interceptors are to be installed at a minimum distance of 10 feet from sinks and
dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of wastewater. Water temperatures must be
less than 140° F. prior to entering the grease interceptor.
All grease bearing waste streams should be routed through an appropriate grease
interceptor, including: three compartment sinks, pot/pan sinks, soup kettles, handwashing
sinks, dishwashers, mop sinks and floor drains.
Notable Exceptions. Drains that receive "clear water" only, such as from ice machines,
condensate from coils and drink stations, may be plumbed to the sewer system without
passing through the grease interceptor with the condition that the receiving drain is a
"hub" type that is a minimum of two inches above the finished floor.
All exterior or recessed grease interceptors are to be installed with an effluent sampling
chamber.
§ 18-506. Grease Interceptor Construction.
[Ord. 2012-O-5, 8/22/2012, § 1]
Any person responsible for discharges requiring a grease interceptor shall, at his own expense
and as required by the Authority, provide plans and specifications for equipment and facilities of a
design type and design capacity as described in § 505.2 approved by the Authority. The grease
interceptor must be in compliance with the current applicable plumbing codes. The person shall
locate the grease interceptor in a manner that provides easy accessibility for cleaning and

inspection and maintain the grease interceptor in effective operating condition. The Authority shall
inspect the grease interceptor during construction and upon completion. All interested parties shall
make a final inspection before any service connections are made.
Construction of items listed herein in accordance herewith or in accordance to the Authority's
specifications shall not constitute a defense to unlawful discharge and shall not limit the
generator's liability for any surcharge stated in this division.
An inspection port shall be provided for the flow control device regulating flow into the grease
interceptor.
Except for under the sink grease traps, each grease interceptor shall be located outside of a
building or structure in an area accessible for service, and so installed and connected that it shall
be at all times easily accessible for inspection, and for cleaning and removal of the intercepted
waste. Inspection ports and monitoring ports shall be in areas where vehicles may not temporarily
block access to inspection. The use of ladders or the removal of bulky equipment or stored
materials in order to access inspection or monitoring ports shall constitute a violation of
accessibility. A grease interceptor shall not be installed in any part of a building where food is
handled. The location of all grease interceptors, inspection ports, and monitoring ports shall meet
the approval of the Authority and shall be shown on the approved building plans.
A one piece removable metal plate covering the entire grease interceptor shall be preferred as an
inspection port, though at the discretion of the Authority, standard manhole ports may be installed
over each divider in the grease interceptor. In either case, all parts of the grease interceptor shall
be easily accessible for cleaning and visual inspection.
A monitoring port, where required by the Authority, shall be provided for ease in sampling the
treated effluent from the grease interceptor and shall be as close as possible to the connection
with the sewer system within the bounds of the existing facility's property. The monitoring port shall
be installed according to the specifications of the Authority. The monitoring port shall be installed
and maintained at the generator's expense. A generator shall properly place, monitor, and
maintain the monitoring port so that wastewater samples taken from the monitoring port are
representative of wastewater leaving the grease interceptor. It shall be unlawful for a generator to
divert wastewater around a monitoring port into the sewer system.
§ 18-507. Under the Sink Grease Traps/Interior Active
Interceptors.
[Ord. 2012-O-5, 8/22/2012, § 1]
In the event that an outside grease interceptor is not practicable, an under the sink grease trap or
interior active interceptor may be installed subject to the approval of the Authority. Under the sink
grease traps/interior active interceptors are subject to the following additional requirements:
General Requirements.
The location of such grease traps/interior active interceptors shall be in as close proximity
to the source of wastewater as physically possible.
The lid shall be secured to the body with a single bolt. No wing nuts or screws shall be
permitted.
The lid shall cover the deep seal grease trap/interior active interceptor. The deep seal
grease trap/interior active interceptor shall be constructed so as to eliminate the
possibility of sewer gas entering the kitchen area.

the floor with the top flush with the floor, or fully recessed below the floor to suit piping
and structural conditions, as acceptable to the Authority.
There shall be sufficient clearance for the removal of the cover for cleaning.
Unless specifically approved by the Authority, runs of pipe exceeding 25 feet between the
fixture and grease trap/interior active interceptor shall not be permitted.
The grease trap/interior active interceptor shall not be installed in a waste line from a
garbage grinder.
A suitable flow control fitting shall be installed ahead of the grease trap/interior active
interceptor in the waste line beyond the fixture and as close as possible to the underside
of the lowest fixture. When wastes of two or more sinks or fixtures are combined to be
used by one grease trap/interior active interceptor, a single flow control fitting shall be
used.
Air intake for flow control either shall terminate under the sink drain board as high as
possible to prevent overflow, or shall terminate in a return bend at the same height and
on the outside of the building.
To retain water and prevent siphoning, all grease traps/interior active interceptors shall
have a vented waste line, sized in accordance with the current applicable plumbing
codes.
With the approval of the Authority, one grease trap/interior active interceptor may be used
to serve multiple fixtures if the fixtures are located close together and the grease
trap/interior active interceptor is sized to meet the combined flow of all the fixtures.
Under the sink grease traps/interior active interceptors shall be cleaned at a minimum of
every three days. A cleaning log shall be maintained.
§ 18-508. License Requirements.
[Ord. 2012-O-5, 8/22/2012, § 1; as amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
It is unlawful for any existing facility or new facility to discharge wastewater from a grease
interceptor without authorization in the form of a FOG license. Application for a FOG license shall
be made to the Authority. If, after examining the information contained in the FOG license
application, it is determined by the Authority that the proposed discharge does not conflict with the
provisions of this Part, or any other Federal, State, or local requirement or regulation, a FOG
license shall be issued, at the same time the food establishment license is paid and issued,

Unless otherwise specified by the Authority, each grease interceptor in active use should be
cleaned at least once every 90 days or more frequently as needed to prevent carry-over of
grease into the sewer system, unless it can be demonstrated to the Authority that the
pumping frequency can be performed at greater intervals with best management practices.
The Authority may specify cleaning more frequently when quarterly pumping is shown to be
inadequate. Additional pumping may be required during time periods where increased loading
is anticipated. Any generator desiring a schedule less frequent than 90 days shall submit a
request to the Authority along with testing (as required by the Authority) and copies of the
cleaning records for the last four cleanings, including measurements of the thickness of the
surface scum/grease layer and solids.
At any time if the Authority finds the grease interceptor to be full, immediate steps shall be
taken by the generator to pump out and clean the grease interceptor as soon as is
practicable. The Authority shall make an evaluation of the advisability of allowing discharge to
continue, and may at his or her discretion order an immediate cessation of all discharge from
the existing facility. In any case, the FOG license of the existing facility may be amended so
as to compel more frequent pumping and cleaning of the grease interceptor.
[Amended by Ord. 2016-O-6, 11/9/2016]
Requirement for Increased Pumpage or Servicing.
If the authorized agent finds that a change in pumpage or servicing of a grease interceptor is
necessary for an establishment to meet the discharge limits stated in this Part, the Authority
may order a change in pumpage or servicing. If the Authority orders a change in the pumpage
or servicing, then the Authority shall serve notice of such order upon the generator. The
owner may request and shall be granted a hearing before the Authority. Such hearing shall be
requested by filing a petition, in writing, stating the grounds of the petition within five days
after notice of the authorized agent's decision and paying an administration fee in an amount
as established from time to time by resolution of the Authority. The hearing shall commence
within 30 days of filing of the petition unless postponed for good cause. At the hearing to
review the order, the generator may present evidence, and the Authority may make new
findings and issue new orders to change the frequency and/or methods of pumpage or
servicing, it shall be unlawful for a generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sewer
system not in compliance with such order.
A generator shall cause the liquid waste hauler, transporter, or any other person cleaning or
servicing a grease interceptor to completely evacuate all contents, including floating materials,
wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids, of all grease interceptors during servicing. Skimming
the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of the grease interceptor or use of any method
that does not remove the entire contents of the collection device is prohibited. The suction of the
floating materials shall be done prior to removal of other contents. After complete evacuation, the
walls, top, and bottom of the grease interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped and the residue
removed. Upon completion of the servicing, the Manager of the existing facility shall make an
inspection of the interior of the grease interceptor and then personally sign the manifest. The
Manager shall make an appropriate entry in the maintenance log, and post the generator section
of the manifest in a conspicuous place with the log on the premises. Said manifests and
maintenance logs shall be made immediately available to any authorized agent.
Each grease interceptor pumped shall be fully evacuated unless the grease interceptor volume is
greater than the tank capacity on the vacuum truck in which case the transporter shall arrange for
additional transportation capacity so that the grease interceptor is full evacuated within a twentyfour-
hour period following the transporter's inability to fully evacuate the grease interceptor.
It shall be unlawful for a generator to allow the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids back into
a grease interceptor during and/or after servicing. Decanting or discharging of removed
wastewater back into the grease interceptor from which the wastewater was removed or any other
grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.

Restoration of Public Ways. If during the course of grantee's construction, operation, and/or
maintenance of its facilities and equipment there occurs a disturbance of any public way by
grantee, grantee shall, at its expense, replace and restore such public way to a condition which
existed immediately prior to such disturbance. If grantee excavates the surface of any public way,
grantee shall be responsible for restoration of the public way and its surface within the area
affected by the excavation. The Township reserves the right, after providing notice to grantee, to
remove and/or repair any work done by grantee which is inadequate. The reasonable cost thereof,

regarding grantee's need to trim trees or other natural growth upon and overhanging public ways
so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with its facilities or equipment.
Trimming shall be limited to the area required to clear its facilities or equipment.
Safety Requirements. All such work in the public ways shall be performed in accordance with
applicable safety codes and technical requirements.

construction schedule for work in the pubic ways which schedule shall be updated as changed.
Upon completion of initial construction and upon completion of construction of any modification to
its facilities, grantee shall provide the Township with a map showing the location of its installed

scale of 150 feet per inch or whatever standard scale the Township adopts for general use.
Excavations. Grantee may make excavations in public ways for any facility subject to obtaining
excavation permits from the Township. Prior to doing such work, grantee must apply for, and
obtain, appropriate permits from the Township, and give appropriate notices to any other licensees
and/or permittees of the Township, and/or other units of government owning or maintaining
facilities which may be affected by the proposed excavation.
Reservation of Township Public Ways. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to prevent the
Township or other agency of government or municipal authority from constructing sewers, grading,
paving, repairing and/or altering any street and/or laying down, repairing and/or removing water
mains and/or constructing and/or establishing any other public work or improvement. If any of the
grantee's facilities or equipment interferes with the construction or repair of any street or public
improvement, including construction, repair or removal of a sewer or water main, the grantee's
facilities or equipment shall be removed or replaced in the manner the respective Township or
other agency of government or municipal authority shall direct. Any and all such removal or
replacement shall be at the expense of the grantee. Should grantee fail to remove, adjust or
relocate its facilities by the date established by the Township or other agency of government or
municipal authority, the Township or other agency of government or municipal authority may cause
and/or effect such removal, adjustment or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be paid by

authorized to make such certification, explaining how the payment was calculated. In connection
with the rental payment due on February 14, the grantee shall also submit to the Township, on that

certified by the grantee's independent certified public accountant verifying the accuracy of the
gross revenue and rental payments for the previous calendar year, with a detailed breakdown and
explanation of the calculation by each month.
Grantee shall keep accurate books of account which shall clearly support the calculation of rentals
and describe in sufficient detail the amounts attributable to each specific component of gross

support thereof including, but not limited to, third party remittances and contract documents, shall
be made available to the Township and its authorized representatives for examination at a location
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, at any time during regular business hours on 10 days prior written
notice and from time to time for the purpose of verifying or identifying rentals owed to the
Township. Grantee shall exercise its best efforts to obtain financial records of affiliates for the
Township for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the rental payments. Township shall have
the right to examine and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Part;
provided, however, that such examination shall take place within 48 months following the close of
each year. Any additional amount due to Township as a result of the examination and
recomputation shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to grantee by the Township,
which notice shall include a copy of the examination report. In the event that said examination
determines that funds are owed to the Township in an amount in excess of 2%, the cost of said
examination shall be borne by the grantee and reimbursed to Township within 30 days following
written notice to grantee.
In the event that any rental or other payment is not made or the requisite documentation and
certification is not provided on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
compounded daily and set at the one year United States Treasury Bill rate existent on the date
payment was due, plus three percentage points. Any amount recomputed to reflect correct
payment due shall bear interest as described from the date such payment was originally due.

Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to establish a Newtown Township off-site traffic
improvement program to implement the Township's traffic circulation study and to provide for
the funding for same by future subdividers and/or land developers, whose developments will
necessitate the off-site improvements which are the subject of this program. This fee program
shall obtain funds for the Township which are necessary to provide and coordinate roadway
and intersection improvements which are necessary as the result of future development in the
Township. The fee program was developed in order to prevent significant degradation of the
level of traffic service as a result of new development throughout the Township. The program
is designed to generate funding for future Township road improvements necessary to
accommodate, in a safe and reasonable manner, the traffic from new development throughout
the Township. The program is not designed to solve existing traffic problems or to be a
substitute for other ordinances pertaining to other required improvements.
Definitions.
AVERAGE DAILY TRIP GENERATION RATE
The highest rate set forth in the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual for all
uses proposed for the site.
FLOOR AREA
The gross floor area of a building or structure.
FUND
The off-site road improvement trust fund established by the Board of Supervisors of
Newtown Township pursuant to this amendment.
ON-SITE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS
All public road related improvements required to be constructed by the developer
pursuant to any ordinance, resolution or requirement of Newtown Township, with the
exception of those off-site road improvement requirements imposed herein. Such on-site
road improvements shall include but not be limited to road improvements on the
developer's property or on public streets and highways immediately abutting and/or
adjacent to the property belonging to the developer and shall include, without limitation,
the following:
Curbs, drainage, sidewalks, bike paths, plus boundary road widening along the
entire frontage of the project on existing streets.
Off-site transitions.
Acceleration and deceleration lanes.
Any other special means of ingress/egress that involves road improvements.
Road improvements needed to solve problems directly related to the project.
Right-of-way dedications.
Traffic signs and signals whose needs are created solely by the proposed project's
traffic.
OFF-SITE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS
Any road related improvements which are generally not contiguous with the property
being developed and not required as an on-site improvement.
UNIT IMPROVEMENT COST
An amount equal to 1/2 of the total cost of highway improvements as determined by
Newtown Township Traffic Study necessary to accommodate projected future traffic

volumes when the Township is fully developed, LESS highway improvement projects
which are currently funded and those projects required to correct existing deficiencies,
DIVIDED BY the total number of projected new trips when the Township is fully
developed.
Identification of Necessary Public Improvements. The Board of Supervisors of Newtown
Township has caused an extensive Township-wide traffic circulation study to be prepared by
the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, which study has been adopted and
approved by the Board of Supervisors of the Township on the first day of August, 1988, as an
amendment to the Township's Comprehensive Plan. The circulation study has confirmed that
existing traffic flows in the Township and those which are projected to be caused by
developments which have already obtained final land development approval, are adequate or
will be made adequate as a result of funding previously obtained or to be obtained by the
Township in connection with said approvals, or from other sources, including but not limited to
funds from Federal, State and local government. The study has shown, however, through a
comprehensive analysis of the projected Township-wide growth of residential and nonresidential
uses and the traffic impact of such growth, that specific traffic improvements will be
required as a result of future development in the Township. The study has listed the need for
and recommended specific improvements, has estimated the construction cost and benefits
to the traffic flows, and otherwise identified issues affecting implementation of this off-site road
improvement program. In performing the study, the traffic consultant has projected the off-site
traffic improvements that will be required Township-wide as a result of future development in
the Township, both residential and commercial, and has allocated a fair pro-rata share of the
needed additional off-site improvements among the projected future developments on a peak
hour generation basis. Using this method, and an adjustment factor for location, the
consultant has developed a fair share of contribution to be made by future developers to
accommodate the need for off-site road improvements caused by said developments on a
residential per unit basis, and on a square footage basis for office and/or retail space.
Imposition of Assessment. There is hereby imposed upon all traffic generators in Newtown
Township an assessment for the construction of necessary public improvements in
accordance with the formula to be set forth below.
Calculation of Assessment. The assessment imposed by this subsection upon all new traffic
generators shall be determined by applying the unit improvement cost to the total new daily
trips generated by a project. To determine the fee for a specific use, the total new daily trip
generation for the proposed use shall be multiplied by the unit improvement cost. The unit
improvement cost will be set by resolution by the Township Board of Supervisors and shall be
updated at least every other year. The resolution shall include the calculations necessary to
determine the unit improvement cost.
Special Situations. In the event a traffic generator is not sufficiently documented for traffic
generation, the assessment shall be determined through an estimation process using
commonly accepted traffic engineering procedures. An initial preliminary fee shall be
calculated based upon estimated traffic and then adjusted not earlier than one year after the
site is fully operational based upon actual daily traffic surveys.
Establishment of Fund. There is hereby established a Newtown Township Road Improvement
Trust Fund which shall be under the exclusive control of the Board of Supervisors of the
Township. Fees herein imposed upon developers shall be deposited into this fund.
Disbursement shall be made solely for costs of satisfying the construction of road
improvements within Newtown Township.
Time of Payment. Payment of the off-site road improvement fee shall be made at the time of
the issuance of use permits for the subdivision or development.

regulations or applicable State regulations to provide an expert opinion in such matters.
The Historic Resource Impact Study shall include the following:
Owner of record and classification of the historic resource(s).
A site plan showing all existing buildings, structures, foundations, walls, ruins, historic trees
and landscaping, and all other notable features, along with a description of the historic
resource(s).
Recent interior and exterior photographs of the historic resource(s), showing all exterior
views.
The proposed use of the Historic resource(s) and an explanation why this use was chosen.
An examination of alternative uses of the Historic resource(s) and their feasibility.
The effect of the proposed use of the historic resource on the historical significance and
architectural integrity of neighboring historic resources.
In the event the resource is claimed to be in irreparable condition, a certified engineering
report regarding the structural stability of the resource.
A discussion of the historic resource(s) and surrounding historic resources which may be
impacted by the proposed activity.
Any Class I or II Historic Resource shall be preserved unless the applicant demonstrates to the
Board of Supervisors that it is in irreparable condition and cannot be used; provided, however, in
that case the applicant provide a statement that the irreparable condition did not come into
existence during the ownership of the applicant or if the applicant is the equitable owner during the
ownership of the present legal owner, in which such case the irreparable condition even if
determined to be irreparable may be a basis for a requirement that said historic resource be
preserved.
If a subdivision or land development is proposed for the site of one or more Class I or II Historic
Resources, the lot lines of the proposed subdivision or land development shall be drawn so as to
preserve the historic context of the resource(s), including any associated structures, trees, and
landscaping, with adequate setbacks.
Classification.
Historic Resources Inventory and Map. The Township shall maintain an official list of historic
resources prepared by the Newtown Joint Historic Commission entitled the "Newtown
Township Historic Resources Inventory" (hereinafter referred to as "Historic Resources
Inventory" or "inventory") and a map of the resources on that list. The Historic Resources
Inventory and map shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors and may be revised from
time to time by legislative action of the Board of Supervisors.
Definition. For the purposes of this chapter a "historic resource" is any building, structure, site,
property, landscape, village or district listed in the Newtown Township Historic Resources
Inventory. Where the inventory lists outbuildings and/or other structures associated with the
primary structure, these associated outbuildings and structures are afforded the same
protections and incentives as the primary structure unless the inventory clearly denotes the
associated outbuildings/structure as not being historical.
Historic resources shall be delineated into four classes:
Class I. All resources ranked "1" by the inventory. These resources include:

Buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts which have been determined to be
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.
Class II. All resources ranked "2" by the inventory. These resources include:
Buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts not meeting National Register criteria,
but determined to be of historical or architectural value to Newtown Township and
appropriately documented as such in the Inventory.
Class III. All resources ranked "three" by the inventory. These resources include:
All other buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts listed in the inventory not
meeting the criteria for a Class I or Class II Resource but still deserving of protection and
preservation.
Class IV. All Resources ranked "four" by the inventory. These resources include:
Buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts that are historic due to their age, but
whose current condition is so altered from the original form that they are no longer
deserving of protection and preservation. Such resources can be refurbished and reranked.
Part 5. REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN
STANDARDS
§ 22-501. Purpose.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 501]
The purpose of this Part 5 is to establish and define the public improvements and design
standards which will be required by the Township in the review, approval and construction of any
subdivision or land development.
All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with Township design standards. Inspections
to insure that Township specifications are complied with shall be the responsibility of the Township
Engineer.
§ 22-502. Application.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 502]

Whenever Township or other applicable regulations impose more restrictive standards and
requirements than those outlined herein, such other regulations shall control.
Where literal compliance with the standards herein specified is clearly impractical, the Board of
Supervisors may modify or adjust the standards based upon study and recommendation of the
Township Engineer, to permit reasonable utilization of property while securing substantial
conformance with the objectives of this Chapter 22.
§ 22-503. General Requirements.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 503; as amended by Ord. 1996-O-5, 5/8/1996, § I(10)]
Proposed land uses shall be suited to the purposes for which the land is to be subdivided or
developed, and shall conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance and to the Township
Comprehensive Plan.
Proposed subdivisions or land developments shall be coordinated with existing nearby
neighborhoods both within and outside of Newtown Township so that the community as a whole
may develop harmoniously. Where necessary, joint reviews with neighboring townships shall be
required.
Streets, drainage rights-of-way, parking areas, water supply and sewage disposal, school sites,
public parks and playgrounds shall be considered in the approval of all plans.
All portions of a tract being subdivided or developed shall be taken up in lots, streets, public lands
or other proposed uses so that remnants and landlocked areas shall not be created.
In general, lot lines shall follow Township and County boundary lines rather than cross them.
The Supervisors may direct the subdividers to preserve trees, groves, waterways, scenic points,
historic spots and other community assets and landmarks.
Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out so as to avoid the necessity for excessive
cut or fill.
Floodways and floodplains are subject to the provisions of the Township Zoning Ordinance.
Lands which are subject to periodic flooding, or lie within a floodplain zone, shall not be platted or
designated for development or for such other uses as may involve danger to health, safety,
morals, or the general welfare of the citizens as defined by the Zoning Ordinance.
Where no public water supply is available to the subdivision, the Board of Supervisors shall
require the subdivider to obtain from the proper health officer certificates of approval as to the
quality and adequacy of the water supply proposed to be utilized by the subdivider.
Where the subdivision is inaccessible to sanitary sewers, the Board of Supervisors shall require
the subdivider to have a sanitary feasibility report prepared by a competent registered professional
engineer in accordance with the methods and procedures set forth by the Bucks County
Department of Health.
All construction should be in conformance with BOCA International-Basic Building Code
Handicapped Access Provisions illustrated, 1975, as amended, and Township Building Code.

10/11/2000, § I]
The arrangement, character, extent, grade and location of proposed streets shall conform to and
properly relate to such street plans or parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted
by the Township, including recorded subdivision plans, and the requirements of the
Comprehensive Plan and shall be classified according to their function.
Proposed streets shall further conform to such Township and State road and highway plans as
have been prepared, adopted and/or filed as prescribed by law.
Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce usable lots, reasonable
grades, and proper alignment and drainage, in the opinion of the Township Planning Commission
and Township Engineer.
The arrangement of streets shall provide for continuation of existing or platted streets and for
proper access to adjoining undeveloped tracts suitable for future development.
Streets shall be laid out as to discourage through traffic, but provisions for street connections into
and from adjacent areas will generally be required.
If lots resulting from original subdivision are large enough to permit re-subdivision or if a portion of
the tract is not subdivided, adequate street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be
provided as necessary, to be no less than the rights-of-way then required for local streets.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major thoroughfare, collector, or
primary street the Board of Supervisors may require dedication of additional right-of-way to
provide the minimum right-of-way specified hereinafter for that existing or proposed street and to
provide marginal access streets and rear service alleys. The Board of Supervisors may also
require reverse frontage lots with screen planting along the rear property line or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of properties, to afford separation of
through and local traffic and to reduce the number of access points on major streets.
Where, because of additional traffic and drainage, problems are created, both sides of the major
thoroughfare, collector or primary streets are to be improved as a responsibility of the subdivider
himself, or by means of sufficient funds escrowed for use by the Township to execute such
improvement.
New half or partial streets shall not be permitted except where essential to reasonable subdivision
of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards of this Chapter 22 and where,
in addition, dedication of the remaining part of the street has been secured.
Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial street, the other part of the
street shall be plotted within such tract.
Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs designed as temporary culs-de-sac, to
permit future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as culs-de-sac.
Stub streets greater in length than one lot depth shall be provided with a temporary turn-round to
the standards required for culs-de-sac or shall be paved to the full width of the right-of-way for the
last 75 feet of their length.
Where streets continue into adjoining municipalities, evidence of compatibility of design,
particularly with regard to street widths, shall be submitted. The applicant shall coordinate such
design with both municipalities to avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or in improvements
provided.

New streets shall be laid out to continue existing streets at equal or greater width, as regards both
cartway and right-of-way, where such continuations are reasonable and practical in the opinion of
the Township Engineer and Planning Commission.
Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance whether the land is to be dedicated to the Township in fee simple or an
easement is granted to the Township.
Private streets may be approved only if they are designed to meet Township street standards for
right-of-way, paving width, drainage, curbs and gutters.
The right-of-way and cartway widths for all development streets in the Township shall be designed
and improved as follows, except as provided hereunder:
As defined in § 202 of this chapter, streets in residential developments which serve not more
than 50 dwelling units shall meet local street standards; streets which serve more than 50 but
less than 300 dwelling units shall meet primary street standards; and streets which serve 300
or more dwelling units shall meet collector street standards. Streets in industrial, commercial,
office and other developments for nonresidential uses shall meet collector street standards.
The following minimum right-of-way and cartway widths shall be met:
R.O.W. Cartway
Local Street 50' 30 feet
Primary Streets 60' 34 feet
Collector Streets 80' 36 feet
Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the Board of Supervisors for
the following purposes:
A. To promote public safety and convenience.
B. To provide parking space in commercial districts and in areas of high density
residential development.
C. To provide slope rights whenever topography is such that additional right-of-way is
needed to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of three
to one.
Short extension of existing streets with lesser right-of-way and/or cartway widths than prescribed
above may be permitted; provided, however, that no section of the right-of-way shall be less than
40 feet in width and the cartway shall not be less than 22 feet in width.
The construction of streets, roads, lanes and driveways as shown on final plans and as contained
in contract agreements shall in every respect conform to all Township design standards for the
construction of streets.
All construction shall proceed as scheduled and in conjunction with scheduled inspections by the
Township Engineer. All materials entering into the construction of streets and the methods of
construction and drainage shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications, Form 408-76, or the latest revision
thereof.
Adequate provisions for the satisfactory maintenance of all streets shall be made by dedication to
and acceptance for maintenance by the Township or by other acceptable means.
All streets shall be graded to the grades shown on the street profiles and cross-section plan
submitted and approved with the final plan and to the full width of the right-of-way.

follows:
Local streets: 150 feet.
Primary streets: 350 feet.
Collector streets: 500 feet.
A tangent shall be required between curves; however, a long radius curve shall be preferred in all
cases to a series of curves and tangents. A minimum tangent of 100 feet shall be required
between reverse curves.
Superelevation (commonly known as "banking a curve") shall be required when curve radii are
less than 600 feet on collector streets, and shall be designed in accordance with Penn-DOT
Design Criteria applicable to the class of roadway.
The approaches to an intersection shall follow a straight course for at least 100 feet, as measured
away from the intersecting lines of rights-of-way.
Any applicant who encroaches within the legal right-of-way of a State highway is required to obtain
a highway occupancy permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Permits Office,
Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

Local streets: 7%; however, 10% may be permitted for short distances, if a less steep slope is
not possible.
Collector streets, primary streets, and major thoroughfares: 5%.
Vertical curves shall be used at change of grade exceeding the algebraic difference of 1% and
shall be designed in relation to the extent of the grade change at a rate of the algebraic difference
of grade times 50 feet to establish the length of the required vertical curve along the center line of
the road, provided that the following minimum sight distances are maintained:
Local streets: 250 feet.
Primary streets: 400 feet.
Collector streets: 500 feet.
Vertical curves shall not produce excessive flatness in grade. There shall be no dips, cross gutter
bumps or humps in the paving.

provided at the closed end with a paved turnaround having a minimum radius to the outer
pavement edge or curb line of 50 feet. Right-of-way shall have a minimum radius of 62 feet within
the turnaround areas. The center line grade on the cul-de-sac turning area shall not exceed 4%.
A temporary cul-de-sac shall be designed so that the cartway is widened to a fifty foot width for a
distance of 75 feet at the turnaround. It shall be the developer's responsibility to remove the
temporary paving.
When required for future extension, the turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the
tract boundary with sufficient width along the boundary line to permit extension of the street at full
width.
Drainage of culs-de-sac shall preferably be towards the open end.
The small triangle of land beyond the cul-de-sac to the boundary shall be so deemed, that, until
the road is continued, maintenance of these corners of land will be the responsibility of the
adjoining owners.
An island with curbing and a minimum radius of 18 feet may be required at the Board of
Supervisors' discretion in the center of the cul-de-sac and shall, if required, be planted in
accordance with the Zoning Ordinance.

§ 22-511. Fire Lanes.
[Ord. 1987-O-171, 10/12/1987]
A fire lane, at least 20 feet in width, shall be provided for all multi-family (other than duplexes, use
B-6) and non-residential buildings. No parking shall be permitted in the fire lane so that firefighting
vehicles shall have direct access to these buildings.
Multi-Family - A macadam fire lane or access road shall be provided on at least one side of
each building, preferably the entrance side parallel to the longest face of the building. The fire
lanes shall be located no farther than the minimum setback distance from the building it is
meant to serve.
The Township may, in appropriate cases, permit parking adjacent to the buildings in lieu of a
fire lane, provided that the fire company has adequate access to the building and the
developer donates $750 per lot to the Newtown Fire Association for the purchase of new
firefighting equipment with longer ladders than presently available, snorkels, etc., which
permit access to the buildings from greater distances.
Non-Residential - A macadam fire lane shall be provided within 20 feet of the building on a
minimum of one side of each building, preferably the entrance side.
Design of Fire Lane - No parking shall be permitted in the fire lane. The fire lane shall be
striped in yellow and shall be marked with signs indicating "fire lane - no parking or standing
at any time" unless waived by the Board of Supervisors.
The Township may require that the road design standards be upgraded for a fire lane to properly
support the weight of a fire truck.
§ 22-512. Street Signs.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 511; as amended by Ord. 91-O-11, 7/22/1991]
Street signs are to be erected before the first dwelling on the street is occupied. Temporary street
signs may be erected on the approval of the Township Engineer but shall be made permanent
before final offer for the dedication of streets is made.
The post or standard shall consist of a 10 feet by 2.375 inches 12 gauge galvanized gatorshield
pipe or equivalent as approved, of sufficient length to allow the bottom of the sign to be eight feet
from the curb or ground final grade and long enough to allow at least two feet being embedded in
a hole at least nine inches in diameter, two feet deep, and shall rest on a steel plate or flat stone at
the bottom of the hole and have at least 1 1/2 feet of concrete poured around it, so that the post
will be permanently plumb.

Not only handle the anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided or
developed, but also the existing run-off being contributed from all land at a higher elevation in
the same watershed.
Maintain the adequacy of the natural stream channels. Accelerated bank erosion shall be
prevented by controlling the rate and velocity of run-off discharge to these water courses, so
as to avoid increasing occurrence of stream bank overflow.
Preserve the adequacy of existing culverts and bridges shall be preserved by suppressing the
new flood peaks created by new land development.
If in the course of preparing or reviewing the Stormwater Management Plan the Township
determines that off-site improvements are necessary to satisfactorily handle the stormwater
from the proposed development the developer shall be responsible for the off-site
improvements.
Retention of existing watercourses and natural drainage features:
Whenever a watercourse, stream, or intermittent stream is located within a development site,
it shall remain open in its natural state and location and shall not be piped.
The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent property shall not be altered
without the written approval of the affected landowners.
No storm water run-off or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to overload existing
drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for additional drainage structures on other
private properties or public lands.
Requirements for drainage structures and/or pipes:
Drainage Easements: Drainage easements shall be provided to accommodate all storm
drainage requirements and shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.
Storm Drainage Pipe: The minimum diameter of all storm drainage pipe shall be 15 inches or
an equivalent thereto, with the exception of detention basins where smaller pipe may be
utilized where necessary to provide the required detention. The minimum grade of piping shall
be 0.5%. Structures shall conform to Pennsylvania Department of Transportation

facilities will be properly maintained. If all or a portion of the facilities are on property
which will be conveyed to an individual, homeowners' association or any other eventual
owner, the guarantees must be in such a form that they will carry through to the new
owners.
When detention basins are provided, they shall be designed to utilize the natural
contours of the land whenever possible. When such design is impracticable, the
construction of the basin shall utilize slopes as flat as possible to blend the structure into
the terrain. All basins shall have slopes less than four horizontal to one vertical.
Detention ponds shall be designed so that they return to normal conditions within
approximately 12 hours after the termination of the storm, unless the Township Engineer
finds that downstream conditions may warrant other design criteria for storm water
release.
Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention facilities to handle run-off in
excess of design flows.
If the land of the proposed subdivision or land development will be conveyed to two or
more separate owners, the developer shall provide written assurance and deed
restrictions to the Township that the detention basins will be properly maintained by the
owners or, if acceptable to the Township, de dedicated to the Township, which shall then
be responsible for maintaining the detention basins.

Design Criteria:
All plans and designs for storm water management facilities shall determine storm water peak
discharge and run-off by use of the Soil Cover Complex Method as set forth in the latest
edition of "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release 55" and "National
Engineering Handbook, Section 4, Hydrology, as published by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service. The following rainfall intensities shall be used for the
twenty-four-hour, Type II distribution storm with average antecedent moisture conditions for
the frequencies shown:
One year: 2.70 inches.
Two years: 3.30 inches.
Five years: 4.20 inches.
Ten years: 5.00 inches.
Twenty-five years: 5.90 inches.
Fifty years: 6.40 inches.
One hundred years: 7.20 inches.
All developments shall limit the rate of storm water run-off, so that no greater rate of run-off is
permitted than that of the site in its natural condition for the same frequency storm. Where
farm field or disturbed earth is the existing condition, meadow shall be used as the starting
base for such calculations, regardless of the actual condition.
The increased run-off which may result from subdivision or land development shall be
controlled by permanent run-off control measures. All run-off control measures will be
evaluated for their effectiveness to maintain the above standard for all storms with a return
period of up to 100 years.
An overflow system shall be provided to carry run-off to the detention basins, when the
capacity of the storm drain pipe system is exceeded. The overflow system shall have
sufficient capacity to carry the run-off difference between the one-hundred-year storm peak
flow rate and the capacity of the storm drain pipe system. The one-hundred-year storm peak
shall be calculated by the Soil Cover Complex Method.
Detention basis shall not be located within floodplains; nor within areas of floodplain soils with
the exception that areas of alluvial soils may be utilized if proof is accepted that the area is
not subject to flooding.
Detention basins shall be designed to facilitate regular maintenance, mowing and periodic
desilting and reseeding. In residential developments, shallow broad basins shall be provided
for recreational use. The area of basins which have more than 50% of the perimeter of their
sides in slopes of greater than 10% or basins that retain storm water for more than 24 hours
shall not be included in the open space required.
The maximum slope of the earthen detention basin embankments shall be four to one. The
top or toe of any slope shall be located a minimum of five feet from any property line.

Whenever possible the side slopes and basin shape shall conform to the natural topography.
The minimum top width of the detention basin berm shall be 10 feet.
In order to insure proper drainage on the basin bottom, a minimum grade of 2% shall be
maintained for areas of sheet flow. For channel flow a minimum grade of 1.0% shall be
maintained. A collecting swale shall be provided to drain basins for use in recreation.
Whenever possible, the emergency spillway for detention basins shall be constructed on
undisturbed ground. Emergency spillways shall be constructed of reinforced concrete or, in
lieu thereof, concrete grass pavers. All emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the
detention basin berm is protected against erosion. The minimum capacity of all emergency
spillways shall be the peak flow rate from the one-hundred-year design storm after
development. The construction material of the emergency spillway shall extend along the
upstream and downstream berm embankment slopes. The upstream edge of the emergency
spillway shall be a minimum of three feet below the spillway crest elevation. The downstream
slope of the spillway shall as a minimum extend to the toe of the berm embankment. The
emergency spillway shall not discharge over earthen fill and/or easily erodible material.
The minimum freeboard shall be one foot. Freeboard is the difference between the design
flow elevations in the emergency spillway and the top of the settled detention basin
embankment.
Anti-seep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of
the detention basin berms. The anti-seep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall
be watertight. The anti-seep collars shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of
the principal pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between collars shall be 14 times the
minimum projection of the collar measured perpendicular to the pipe. A minimum of two antiseep
collars shall be installed on each outlet pipe.
All outlet pipes through the basin berm shall be reinforced concrete pipe with watertight joints.
Energy dissipating devices (rip-rap, end sills, etc.) shall be placed at all basin outlets.
A perforated riser shall be provided at each outlet of all detention basins during construction
for sediment control. The riser shall be constructed of metal or concrete. The rise shall extend
to a maximum elevation of two feet below the crest elevation of the emergency spillway. The
perforated riser shall be designed so that the rate of outflow is controlled by the pipe barrel
through the basin berm when the depth of water within the basin exceeds the height of the
riser. Circular perforations with a maximum diameter of one inch shall be spaced eight inches
vertically and 12 inches horizontally. The perforation shall be cleanly cut and shall not be
susceptible to enlargement. All metal risers shall be suitably coated to prevent corrosion. A
trash rack or similar appurtenance shall have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be of sufficient weight to prevent flotation of the riser. An antivortex
device, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to the basic berm, shall be provided on
the top of the riser.
All drainage channels shall be designed to prevent erosion of the bed and banks. The
maximum permissible flow velocity shall not exceed those outlined in Table 3, § 522. Suitable
stabilization shall be provided where required to prevent erosion of the drainage channels.
Any vegetated drainage channel requiring mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum
grade of four horizontal to one vertical on those areas to be mowed.
Because of the critical nature of vegetated drainage channels, the design of all vegetated
channels shall, as a minimum, conform to the design procedures outlined in the Bucks County
Erosion Sediment Control Handbook.

General Provisions and Compliance:
No changes shall be made to the contour of the land, and no grading, excavating, removal or
destruction of the topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced,
until such time as a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been processed, and
reviewed by the Planning Commission, the Bucks County Conservation District and the Board
of Supervisors.
Approval by the Board of Supervisors of all preliminary and/or final plans of subdivision and
land development does not relieve the developer of his obligation to execute the erosion and
sediment control measures as contained in this § 522.
Final approval of plans and specifications by the Soil Conservation Service for the control of
erosion and sedimentation shall be concurrent with the approval of the plans of subdivision or
land development, and become a part thereof. Final plans for minimizing erosion and
sedimentation as approved will be incorporated in the agreement and bond requirements as
required by the Township.
At the time a building permit is applied for, a review shall be conducted by the Township
Engineer to insure conformance with the plan as approved. During construction, further
consultative technical assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Bucks County
Conservation District. During the development phase, the Township Engineer shall inspect the
development site and enforce compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control
plans.
General Performance Standards:
Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall, as a minimum, meet the

The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control and drainage shall be
installed as soon as practical in the development.
Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the increased run-off caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development within the site. Where
necessary, the rate of surface water run-off will be mechanically retarded.
Sediment in the run-off water shall be trapped until the disturbed area is stabilized by the
use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures.
Site Grading for Erosion Control. In order to provide more suitable sites for building and other
uses, improve surface drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from buildings and

dispose of surface water without ponding, except where ponding (detention basins, etc.) is
part of the storm water management plan for the site.
Concentration of surface water run-off shall be permitted only in swales, watercourses, or
detention basins. Subject to the approval of the Township Engineer, swales shall be sodded,
utilize jute matting, or other similar measures to insure proper growth of the ground cover.
Grading shall in no case be done in such a way as to divert water onto the property of another
landowner.
During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control must be exercised.

such sedimentation to remove it from all affected surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses on and off-site, and to repair any damage at his expense as quickly as possible.
Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses, both existing and proposed, within
any proposed subdivision or land development shall be the responsibility of the developer
until such time as one of the following is accomplished:
An easement for these facilities is offered for dedication by the developer and is accepted
by the Township; it shall then be the responsibility of the Township.
If a lot owners' easement acceptable to the Township is established, the maintenance
shall then be the responsibility of the individual lot owners over whose property the
easement passes. For land developments, the maintenance shall then be the
responsibility of the owner.
A homeowners' association or other approved legal entity, approved by the Township,
assumes the responsibility for the maintenance of the development, including the
maintenance of the watercourses and/or drainage facilities.
It is the responsibility of any person, corporation, or entity doing any work on or across a
stream, watercourse, or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-of-way during the period of the
work, to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
No person, corporation, or other entity shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any
structure or deposit any material or thing or perform any work which will affect normal or flood
flow in any communal stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the
Township and/or Department of Environmental Resources, whichever is applicable.
Each person, corporation or other entity which makes any surface changes shall be required
to:
Collect on-site surface run-off and control it to a point of discharge into the natural
watercourse of the drainage area.
Handle existing off-site run-off through his development by designing it to adequately
handle all upstream run-off.
Provide and install at his expense, in accordance with Township requirements, all
drainage and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent) as required by
the approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
Storm and Surface Drainage:
All subdivision and land development plans shall include designed methods to withhold and
release, at a controlled rate, any run-off onto adjacent property.
Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away from buildings.
Storm sewers, culverts, and related installations shall be provided:
To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses and in such a manner as to protect the
natural character of the watercourses and to provide regulated discharge;
To insure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of streets; and
To intercept storm water run-off along streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent
and grade of the area drained and to prevent substantial flow of water across
intersections.

Storm sewers, as required, shall be placed in the right-of-way, parallel to the roadway and
shall be designed as a combination storm sewer and underdrain. When located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within an easement not less than 20 feet wide, as
approved by the Township Engineer.
Manholes shall be not more than 300 feet apart on sizes up to 24 inches, and not more than
four hundred 450 feet apart on greater sizes. Inlets may be substitute for manholes, on
approval by the Township Engineer as the same spacing required for manholes. In no case
shall inlets be spaced more than 450 feet apart.
Inlets and manhole covers and frames shall conform to Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications. At street intersections, inlets shall be placed in the tangent and
not in the curved portion of the curbing.
Storm water roof drains shall not discharge water directly onto a sidewalk or a street, and
shall be constructed to retain all discharge wholly on the property except where such
discharge can be conveyed to a storm sewer system.
Drainage structures, which drain watershed areas in excess of 1/2 square mile (320 acres), or
which have a span of eight feet or more, shall be designed for a maximum expected run-off
as calculated using the Soil Conservation Service Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds (less than 2,000 acres)." The design storm shall be a minimum fiftyyear
storm. A one-hundred-year storm shall be used if the structure will significantly affect the
existing one-hundred-year floodplain. A Water Obstruction Permit shall be obtained from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources for the waterway opening before final
design is undertaken.
The cartway area over the bridge shall be as wide as the widest road connecting with the
bridge, or if the character of the road is expected to change for future planning, the cartway of
the bridge shall be made to anticipate this condition.
Maximum Expected Discharge:
The maximum expected discharge (M.E.D.) shall be defined as the maximum expected
quantity of water, created by the design storm, arriving at a particular location (inlet, ditch,
etc.).
The design storm is a selected intensity of rainfall, which tends to occur once during a
specified period of years.
The Soil Conservation Service Technical Release #55, "Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds (less than 2,000 acres)," shall be used for the calculation of the maximum
expected discharge.
The maximum expected discharge from drainage areas contributing to the storm drain pipe
system may be determined by the use of the Rational Equation, when the total drainage area
does not exceed 100 acres.
The Rational Equation is as follows:
Q = CIA
WHERE
Q = maximum expected discharge in cubic feet per second.
C = run-off factor expressed as a percent of the total water falling on an area.
I = the rate of rainfall for the term of concentration of the drainage area in inches per
hour for a given storm frequency.
A = the drainage area expressed in acres.

The above equation assumes than one inch of rainfall falling on one acre of land falls at the
rate of one cubic foot per second. Thus, the total quantity of water falling on an area is
represented by IA.
It is necessary to adjust the total quantity of water falling on an area (IA) because certain
percentage of the water is dissipated by evaporation, transpiration, percolation, ponding, and
physical characteristics such as sinkholes. Therefore, the run-off factor "C" is introduced into
the Rational Equation to account for the dissipated water.
The run-off factor "C" is a percentage factor which represents the proportion of the total
quantity of water falling on the area that remains as run-off.
Consideration should be given to future land use changes in the drainage area in
selecting the "C" factor. For drainage areas containing several different types of ground
cover, a weighted value of "C" must be used.
In no case shall a weighted value of "C" be less than 0.50 for an area to be changed from
its natural state.

Roofs and all impervious surfaces 0.90
All other surfaces except forest 0.40
Forest 0.30
The coefficients in these two tabulations are applicable for storms of ten-year frequency and
less. The coefficients are based on the assumption that the design storm does not occur
when the ground is frozen. Less frequent, higher intensity storms will require the use of higher
coefficients because infiltration and other losses have a proportionally smaller effect on runoff.
For less frequent storms, the coefficients can be used if they are multiplied by the following
factors for the return frequency required.

Storm Frequency:
A ten-year storm frequency shall be used for the design of all storm water systems
within the Township.
In all cases where storm drainage is picked up by means of a headwall or inlet
structure, and inlet or outlet conditions control, the pipe shall be designed as a
culvert for a twenty-five-year design storm.
Storm Duration:
A five minute storm duration shall be used if this duration does not result in a
maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capacity of a thirty-inch pipe.
If a five minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, the time of
concentration approach shall be used in determining storm duration.
If a five minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, within any
run of pipe, the time of concentration approach may be used for sizing of pipes from
that point on by adjusting the time of concentration.
Time of concentration may be defined as the interval of time required for water from
the most remote portion of the drainage area to reach the point in question.
Time of Concentration may be influenced by:
The type of terrain over which the water must flow. See Table 1 for recommended
average velocities of run-off flow.
Stream velocities - prior to reaching the point in question, the water may flow over
land and subsequently flow into a stream. The stream velocities shall be calculated
from Manning's Equation. (See Subsection (8)(B) of this § 522.)
The time of concentration shall be determined by the above indicated criteria.
Editor's Note: Figure E is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Drainage Area "A." The extent of an individual drainage area shall be outlined on a map of
highest order available and submitted in duplicate to the Township Engineer with the Design
Calculations for Storm Sewers. The plan shall also indicate the "Q" anticipated at each
proposed inlet and the slope of the street or swale used to compute the inlet capacity. Care
should be taken to assure that all areas delivering run-off to the point under consideration
shall be included.

Capacity of Waterway Areas:
This Subsection (8) is primarily concerned with the removal of the water arriving at a
particular location.
It is necessary that the drainage facilities assisting in removal of water from the surface of the
highway and adjacent ground have adequate capacity to do so.
The capacity of the drainage facilities is measured in terms of discharge and may be
determined by the equation of continuity:
Q = AV
Where:
Q = Discharge of water in cubic feet per second.
The discharge capacity for a drainage facility at a particular location
shall be equal to or greater than the maximum expected discharge
(M.E.D.) for the location.
A = The net effective area in square feet provided by the drainage facility.
By net effective area is meant that cross-sectional area of the facility
which may be used to carry water. It may not be desirable that the
entire cross-sectional area of the drainage facility be utilized to carry
water.
V = The velocity of the water in feet per second. The velocity shall be
determined by Manning's Equation.
Manning's Equation is as follows:
V =
1,486
n
R S
Where:
V = Velocity in feet per second.
R = Hydraulic radius is equal to the net effective area (A) divided by the
wetted perimeter (W.P.):
R =
A
W.P.
The wetted perimeter is the lineal feet of the drainage facility crosssection
which is wetted by the water.
S = Slope of energy line (for approximation, use water surface slope in
wetted stream and stream bed slope in dry stream).
n = The roughness coefficient. Acceptable roughness coefficients are
presented in Table 2.

Design Criteria: Additional design criteria for specific drainage facilities are required as follows:
Shoulders in Cut Areas (without swales).
Water flowing in the shoulder shall not encroach more than two-thirds the shoulder width
during a ten-year frequency storm of five-minute duration.
The maximum velocity as determined by Manning's Equation shall not exceed the
allowable velocities as shown in Table 3 for the specific type of shoulder material.
Inlets shall be provided to control the shoulder encroachment and water velocity.
Swales adjacent to shoulders.
When swales are provided in cut areas, the water shall not encroach upon the roadway
area during a ten-year frequency storm of five-minute duration.
The maximum velocity as determined by Manning's Equation shall not exceed the
allowable velocities as shown in Table 3 for the specific type of swale material.
Capacity of the swale shall be as shown in Figure G.

Curbed Sections: The maximum encroachment of water on the roadway pavement shall not
exceed four inches in depth at the curb during a ten-year frequency storm of five minute
duration (See Figure F). Inlets shall be provided to control the encroachment of water on the
pavement.
Inlets:
When there is a change in pipe size in the inlet, the elevation for the top of pipes should
be the same or the smaller pipe higher. A minimum drop of two inches should be
provided in the inlet between the lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe
invert elevation.
If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed median section exceeds
the assumed inlet capacities, the inlet capacities shall govern the spacing of inlets.
If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section, or depressed median section is less
than the inlet capacities, then the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed section
capacity shall govern the spacing of inlets.
Type C Inlets:
This type of inlet is designated for installation in nonmountable curbs.
It should be noted that inlets will operate more efficiently when they are spaced so
that 5% of the gutter flow is permitted to bypass the inlet 95% efficiency). Therefore,
95% efficiency will be acceptable if 100% is not practical.
Inlet capacities shall be based on Figure F, "Inlet and Gutter Flow Curves."
The capacity of an inlet at a low point of a street vertical curve may be designed to
accept 4.0 cfs from each direction or a maximum of 8.0 cfs.
Type M and S Inlets:
Type S Inlets are designated for installation in shoulder swale areas with back
slopers 6:1 and steeper. Type M Inlets are designated to be used in swale areas
where the back slope is flatter than 6:1.
Inlet capacities shall be based on Table 4, "Type M & S Inlet Capacities."
Where a drainage dike is used the side slope of the dike shall be 8:1 or flatter.
The capacity of an inlet at a low point in the swale (sump condition) is a 16 cfs
maximum.
Storm Pipes:
To facilitate the solution of Manning's Equation as applied to storm pipes, charts are
presented in "Design Charts for Open-Channel Flow" prepared by the U.S. Department
of Commerce, which permit a direct determination of the capacity of circular pipes.
Where headroom is restricted, equivalent pipe arches may be used in lieu of circular
pipe.
The minimum diameter of storm pipe shall be 15 inches.
Storm pipes will be provided in three-inch increments of diameter.

Abrupt changes in direction or slope of pipe shall be avoided. Where such abrupt
changes are required, an inlet or manhole shall be placed at the point of change.
The minimum slope in a pipe shall provide a minimum velocity of 2.5 fps but shall not
have a minimum slope of less than 0.5%.
The top of storm pipes shall be at least six inches below sub-grade elevation, except cast
iron pipe, which may be within three inches.

Where an approved public water system is within 1,000 feet from the subdivision or land
development, all necessary mains and laterals for connection from the lots to the system, as
shown on the preliminary and final plans, shall be installed by the developer.
The developer shall construct water mains in such a manner as to make adequate water service
available to each principal building or dwelling unit within the subdivision or land development. The
entire system shall be designed in accordance with the requirements and standards of the
applicable water authority and shall be subject to its approval. The water supply must comply with
the regulations and standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
Mains must be sized to provide for adequate pressure and supply for the anticipated demands of
the subdivision and to meet the minimum requirements for fire protection established by the
Middle Department Association of Fire Underwriters. Minimum main size shall be eight inches.
If adequate source of supply is available, hydrants shall be installed at a maximum spacing so that
properties to be built upon shall be within 780 feet of the hydrant which shall also be in appropriate
locations to prevent damage to same. If adequate supply is not available, hydrant connections
shall be provided for future installation. Review and approval by the appropriate fire prevention
official shall be required in order to insure that adequate fire protection is provided.
If water is to be provided by means other than by private wells owned and maintained by the
individual owners of lots within the subdivision or development, applicants shall present clear
evidence to the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission, as the case may be, that the
subdivision or development is to be supplied by a certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative
association of lot owners, or by a municipal corporation, authority or utility, and all documents
necessary to establish the entity or contract with the entity supplying water shall be submitted to
the Township and approved by the Township as a condition of final plan approval. A copy of the
certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an application
for such certificate, a cooperative agreement or a commitment or agreement to serve the area in

Joint Municipal Authority, the Bucks County Planning Commission, and approval of amendment to
the Act 537 Master Sewer Plan.
If no such existing sanitary sewer facilities are available, but will become available within 10 years,
according to the Master Plan for the Newtown Bucks County Joint Municipal Authority and other
relevant County and State agencies, the developer shall install sewer lines, including lateral
connections, as may be necessary to provide adequate service to each lot when connection with
the public sanitary sewer system is made. The sewer lines shall be suitably capped at the limits of
the subdivision and the laterals shall be capped at the right-of-way line. The sewer installation
shall include the construction within rights-of-way or easements to bring the sewer to the future
connection with the Authority sanitary sewer system.
A sewer shall be considered to be planned for extension to a given area any time after preliminary
engineering and related studies have been completed and the construction of facilities adequate
to serve the area containing the subdivision has been programmed for completion within a
reasonable time. The Authority shall determine, in writing, that a proposed subdivision or land
development is or is not accessible for connection to its sewerage system.
When capped sewers are required and provided, on-site disposal facilities shall also be provided,
in accordance with appropriate government regulations, provided they are so located as to permit
easy and the least expensive connection to the sewer, when it becomes usable. Three accurate
engineering drawings of the on-site systems installed shall be provided: two for the purchaser, and
one for the Township. All procedures and design of facilities shall be in conformance with the
requirements of the County Health Department and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources and applicable Township regulations.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to make the connection to the applicable municipal
sanitary sewage facility to all dwellings involved within 60 days after notification in writing that such
connections are authorized. Appropriate escrow funds identified for such purposes shall be
established and remain in effect until such time as permanent connection is made to the system.
The amount of such funds shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors to insure future
connection to the public system.
§ 22-526. Private Sewage Disposal Systems.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 525]
If public sewer facilities are not available, the developer shall provide for sewage disposal on an
individual lot basis according to the rules, regulations, terms, definitions and conditions of the
individual sewage disposal system application and certification procedure for Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, adopted by the Bucks County Board of Commissioners on March 24, 1971, and any
amendments made thereto.
When on-lot sewage disposal facilities are proposed, a written report from the Bucks County
Health Department must be received by the Board of Supervisors indicating the suitability of all
lots for on-site sewage disposal. The dimensioned location of the on-lot sewage system and the
well must be shown on the plan prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Each owner or occupant of a dwelling unit with on-lot facilities shall be provided with a plan of the
system and an instruction manual for the use and proper maintenance of the system by the
developer.

All other utility lines including, but not limited to, electric, gas, street light supply, cable TV, and
telephone shall be placed underground, except where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Board of Supervisors that the underground installation required herein is not feasible because of
the physical condition of the lands involved.
Installation of all utilities shall be in strict accordance with the engineering standards and
specifications of the Township, municipal authority, or appropriate public utility where concerned.
Where practicable, all utilities shall be located within the street right-of-way, but not under the
cartway, otherwise, easements or rights-of-way of sufficient width for installation and maintenance
shall be provided.
Final plans shall be coordinated with required tree planting, and as-built plans shall show locations
of all utilities.
§ 22-528. Monuments and Markers.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 527]
A monument shall be a stone or concrete post, with a flat top at least four inches across and at
least 24 inches in length, on the top of which is permanently inscribed a center mark.
A marker shall be a metal pipe or pin of at least 1/2 inch in diameter, and at least 24 inches in
length.
Monuments shall be placed in each change in direction of boundary; two to be placed at each
street intersection and one on one side of each street at angle points and at the beginning and
end of curves. Utility easements shall be monumented at their beginning and at their end; and
areas to be conveyed for public use shall be fully monumented at their external boundaries.
Markers may be substituted for monuments only when placed at individual lot corners.

time specified by the Township Engineer.
All monuments and markers shall be checked for accuracy by the Township Engineer, or their
accuracy certified by the owner's engineer. Accuracy of monuments shall be within 3/100 of a foot.
§ 22-529. Landscaping.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 528; as amended by Ord. 91-O-4, 2/18/1991]
General.
Street trees, buffer yards, and other required planting shall be in accordance with applicable
sections of this Chapter 22 and the Zoning Ordinance.
Street trees and other required plant material shall not be planted until the finished grading of
the subdivision or land development has been completed.
Plans for proposed planting shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect and shall
be reviewed by the Township Planning Commission and approved by the Township Board of

end of the guarantee period. Should a disagreement arise to whether the planting is alive and
healthy, a landscape architect shall be retained by the Township at the expense of the
developer to make a final determination.
Where screening is required, it shall be assured by financial security posted with the
governing body in an amount equal to the estimated cost of trees and shrubs and planting.
Such guarantee shall be released only after passage of the second growing season following
planting.
The developer shall be responsible for plant material protected in accordance with this
§ 529(2) for a period of 18 months. Any such tree that dies within the time period shall be
removed including the stump and replaced by a minimum 2 1/2 inch caliper tree of a similar
species at the expense of the developer.
Any part or portion of a site which is not used for buildings, other structures, loading and
parking spaces and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be planted with an
all-season ground cover and shall be landscaped according to an overall plan prepared by a
qualified horticulturist, and approved by the Township Planning Commission.
All mechanical and electrical equipment not enclosed in a structure shall be fully and
completely screened from view from any point in a manner compatible with the architectural
and landscaping style of the remainder of the lot. Such screening shall be subject to site plan
and architectural review by the Township Planning Commission and approval by the Township
Supervisors.
Existing Vegetation.
In cases where natural features existing on the site duplicate or essentially duplicate the
requirements of the street tree, buffering, or landscaping provisions of this Chapter 22, these
requirements may be waived by the Board of Supervisors.
All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a manner as to preserve the
healthy trees and shrubs on the site.
Tree Protection Standards. Where trees are to be preserved pursuant to §§ 903(B)(5) or
903(B)(6) of the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance, the following standards shall apply:
General Requirements.
Grade changes and excavations shall not encroach upon the tree protection zone.
No toxic materials shall be stored within 100 feet of a tree protection zone, including
petroleum based and/or derived products.
The area within the TPZ shall not be built upon, nor shall any materials be stored
there either temporarily or permanently. Vehicles and equipment shall not be parked
in the TPZ.
When tree stumps are located within 10 feet of the tree protection zone the stumps
shall be removed by means of a stump grinder to minimize the effect on surrounding
root systems.
Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment
aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces the lateral movement of the roots
during excavation, which if done by other methods, could damage the intertwined
roots of adjacent trees.
Within four hours of any severence of any roots, all tree roots, all tree roots that have
been exposed and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily

with moist peat moss, moist burlap or other moist biodegradeable material to keep
them from drying out until permanent cover can be installed.
Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not discharge into the tree protection
zone.
Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not be located within the tree
protection zone.
The Tree Protection Zone. Prior to construction the tree protection zone shall be
delineated by the following methods:
The tree protection zone that is delineated on the site prior to construction shall
conform to the approved development plans.
All trees scheduled to remain pursuant to §§ 903(B)(5) or § 903(B)(6) of the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance shall be marked; where groups of trees exist, only the
trees on the edge need to be marked.
A forty-eight inch high wooden snow fence mounted on steel posts, located eight
feet on center, shall be placed along the boundary of the tree protection zone.
In addition to the tree protection zone, trees may be left standing as protection
between the trunks of the trees to be retained and the limits of grading. When
additional trees are used as protection, the tree protection zone on the approved
plan shall be marked in the field so that the additional buffer area is delineated.
When this method of protection is used, these additional trees shall be removed at
the time of completion of the project.
When the wooden snow fence has been installed, it may be inspected and approved
by the municipal arborist or other person designated by the Board of Supervisors
prior to commencing clearing and further construction. The fencing along the tree
protection zone shall be maintained until all work/construction has been completed.
Any damages to the protective fencing shall be replaced and repaired before further
construction shall begin.
Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a tree protection zone
or into trees that are to be retained.
Retaining Walls.
When the original grade can be retained at the tree protection zone line, a retaining
wall shall be constructed outside of the tree protection zone.
The retaining wall shall be designed to comply with the municipal standards for
retaining walls.
In addition, the following methods shall be used to ensure the survival of the tree:
The top of the wall shall be four inches above the finished grade line.
The wall shall be constructed of large stones, brick, building tile, concrete
blocks, or treated wood beams not less than six inches by six inches. A means
for drainage through the wall shall be provided so water will not accumulate on
either side of the wall. Weep holes shall be required with any wall.
Any severed roots as a result of excavation shall be trimmed so that their edges
are smooth and are cut back to a lateral root if exposed.

A layer of clean stone (sized three-quarter to one inch) shall be placed one foot
out from the wall to aid in drainage.
Pruning Methods. All final cuts shall be made sufficiently close to the trunk or parent limb
but without cutting into the branch collar or leaving a protruding stub, according to the
National Arborist Association standards. All necessary pruning cuts must be made to
prevent bark from being torn from the tree and to facilitate rapid healing. Flush cuts are
unacceptable.
Fertilization Methods.
All trees which have experienced any disturbance or have had damage to the roots
or branches shall be fertilized.
Trees shall be fertilized in early fall (September-October) or mid-spring (April-May).
Fall applications are preferred.
Fertilizer shall be broadcast over the soil surface in an area twice the size of the tree
protection zone at the rates given in subsection (e) below. A minimum of 1,000
square feet per tree will receive fertilization.
Fertilizer grade shall have approximately three parts nitrogen to one part phosphorus
to one part potassium (3-1-1 ratio).
Fertilizer shall be applied at a rate equivalent to one pound nitrogen per 1,000
square feet. For example, five pounds of 20-8-8 should be broadcast over a onethousand-
square-foot area.
Trenching and Tunnelling.
If there is no alternative but to locate a utility line through a TPZ, tunnelling shall be
used instead of trenching, except where in the opinion of the municipal arborist,
survival of the tree would not be affected by either method. The Township Engineer
shall determine the most desirable location for the utility line.
Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible, and tamped lightly to avoid air spaces.
If any plant material is to be moved, it must be done in accordance with the specifications set
forth by the American Association of Nurserymen.
All diseased or dead trees shall be promptly removed from the site.
Detention Basin Plants.
Within any detention basin one of the following seed mixtures shall be used.
Crownvetch Establishment (legume).
Crownvetch, plus: 20 lbs/acre.
Tall fescue, plus nurse grass (use one): 25 lbs/acre.
Annual ryegrass, or: 30 lbs/acre.
Perennial ryegrass: 30 lbs/acre.

Crownvetch - Penngift.
Birdsfoot Trefoil - 50/50 mixture of Empire and either Maitland or Viking.
Since other seed varieties may be equally suited to perform the purpose of the mixture
stated in this Chapter 22, or the preferred seeds may not always be readily available,
other seed varieties of equal quality shall be acceptable upon approval from the
Township Engineer.
As a general standard one tree shall be planted per each 45 feet of the perimeter. It is
preferred, however, that this required number of trees be planted in an informal arrangement
if possible. Approved trees for the perimeter of detention basins shall include the following:
Acer rubrum - Red Maple
Liquidambar stryaciflua - Sweet Gum
Nyssa sylvatica - Black Gum
Salix species - Willow
Parking Facilities.
Screen planting shall be provided along each perimeter of a parking area. No less than 10%
of a proposed parking area must consist of buffer areas and islands and must be landscaped
and continually maintained.
Any area for off-street parking or for display, storage, sale, or movement of three or more
motor vehicles shall be enclosed, except at entrances or exists, by an ornamental fence or

Where a planted screen is proposed, it shall incorporate the planting of staggered and
overlapping evergreen and deciduous shrubs of such species and size as will produce within
two growing seasons (May through September) after planting a screen at least four feet
higher than the elevation of the adjacent parking area, and of such density as will obscure
75% of the light emitted from automobile headlights on the premises throughout the full
course of the year. Where the adjacent land elevation is higher than the parking area
elevation, trees and shrubs shall be at least two feet in height, satisfaction of the four-foot
requirements notwithstanding. These provisions shall not, however, interfere with the
maintenance of clear sight lines at intersections. Where such screening is required, it shall be
assured by a performance guarantee posted with the Board of Supervisors in an amount
equal to 20% of the estimated cost of the plantings. Such guarantee shall be released only
after passage of the second growing season following planting.
Parking areas of a twenty-vehicle width shall be separated from one another by planting strips
not less than 10 feet in width.
All parking areas shall have at least one tree of 1 1/2 inch caliper minimum for every five
parking spaces in single bays and one tree of 1 1/2 inch caliper minimum for every 10 parking
spaces in double bays. Trees shall be planted in such a manner to afford maximum protection
from the sun for parked vehicles. A minimum of 10% of any parking lot facility over 2,000
square feet in gross area shall be devoted to landscaping, inclusive of required trees.
Plantings shall be able to survive soot and gas fumes. Trees which have low growing
branches, gum or moisture which may drop on vehicles, blossoms, thorns, seeds, or pods
which may clog drainage facilities shall be avoided. The plantings chosen should be of
sufficient size to be effective the first year they are planted.
For recommended plants, see § 531.
Multiple-Family Developments. For all multi-family developments the following minimum
landscaping shall be provided either on lot or within the general open space in addition to all other
required street tree, parking and buffer requirements:
Any combination of the following shall be required for each dwelling unit:
Either: One two inches caliper shade tree, or
One 4-5 feet evergreen tree, or
Two flowering trees, or eight 2-3 feet shrubs.

[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 531]
In reviewing the subdivision plans, the Board will consider the adequacy of existing or proposed
community facilities to serve the additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision.
Where deemed essential by the Board of Supervisors upon consideration of the particular type of
development proposed and especially in largescale residential developments, the Board of
Supervisors may require the dedication or reservation of such areas or sites of an extent and
location suitable to the needs created by the development for schools, parks and other purposes.
Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities shall be adequate to provide for building
sites, landscaping and off-street parking as appropriate to the use proposed. Such areas should
be located in a manner to best serve the public likely to use the same and to utilize, to the greatest
extent, any topographical features.
Areas offered specifically for recreational or school purposes shall be placed to serve all parts of
the subdivisions, with not less than 100 feet of frontage on a public street, and shall not be
excessively irregular in terrain.

Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown in the Comprehensive Plan
is located in whole or in part in a subdivision or land development, the Board of Supervisors may
require the dedication or reservation of such area within the subdivision or land development.
Where a proposed park, playground or other public use is indicated on a proposed subdivision or
land development plan, the Township Board of Supervisors shall review the plan and make
recommendations.
§ 22-533. Open Space and Recreational Areas.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 532]
Open space shall be provided in all residential developments as specified in the Zoning
Ordinance.
The Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance sets forth the minimum required percentage of open space
required for permitted uses, combinations of permitted uses, and planned residential
developments. Such requirements shall be incorporated in any subdivision or land development
plan.
When open space is required by the Zoning Ordinance, the subdivision and land development
plan shall contain or be supplemented by such material as required to establish the method by
which open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and administered. The plan and other
materials shall be construed as a contract between the landowner(s) and the Township, and shall
be noted on all deeds.
When applicable, the location of the open space shall conform to the Newtown Area Joint
Comprehensive Plan. In addition, due consideration must be given to the preservation and
maintenance of natural features, including large trees, groves, walkways, scenic points, historic
spots, and other community assets.
Any land set aside as open space, of such a size as may be capable of future subdivision under
the regulations of this Chapter 22, must be made subject to a deed restriction or agreement in
form acceptable to the Board of Supervisors and duly recorded in the Office for the Recorder of
Deeds in and for Bucks County, eliminating the possibility of such further subdivision by transfer of
development rights to the Township or other agency approved by the Board of Supervisors.
The following standards shall apply to the provisions of recreation space:
Areas set aside for recreational purposes, such as playgrounds or playfields, shall be of
adequate size and configuration to accommodate the intended use. They should be located to
serve all the residents; and in large developments, more than one area may be required to
serve the residents in close proximity to their dwellings. Access should be provided from a
public street.
Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities shall be adequate to provide for
building sites, landscaping and off-street parking as appropriate to the use proposed.
When open space is intended for active recreational purposes:
At least one side of the recreation area shall abut a street for a minimum distance of 50
feet for access; and,
A buffer as required herein shall be provided when such activities abut residential uses.
Recreational space shall conform to any applicable requirements in the Zoning Ordinance and in
§ 532 of this Chapter 22.

§ 22-534. Non-Residential Development Standards.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 533]
Lotting of individual lots for commercial purposes shall be avoided in favor of a comprehensive
design of the land to be used for such purposes. If any lot is subdivided for commercial purposes,
such subdivision plan shall be accompanied by a site development plan showing the intended
development of the entire tract.
Additional width of streets adjacent to areas proposed for non-residential use may be required as
deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors to assure the free flow of through traffic from
vehicles entering or leaving parking areas. For developments fronting on an existing or proposed
arterial or collector street, the Board of Supervisors may require marginal access to provide
separation from through and local traffic.
When two adjacent lots proposed for non-residential uses front on an arterial or collector street,
the applicant may be required to provide common ingress and egress as well as common offstreet
parking facilities. When three or more adjacent lots are proposed for non-residential uses,
the applicant may be required to provide a service road for common ingress and egress.
Alleys or service streets shall be required in commercial and industrial districts, except where
other adequate provision is made for off-street loading and parking consistent with the use
proposed. Where required, alleys in commercial and industrial districts shall conform to the
Township design standards.
Dead-end alleys shall be avoided; but where this proves impossible, they shall be terminated with
a paved turn-around of adequate dimensions.
Adjacent residential areas shall be protected from potential nuisance of the proposed nonresidential
developments by the provisions of extra depths in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential developments and provisions for a permanently landscaped evergreen buffer
strip.
Streets carrying non-residential traffic shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of the
adjacent existing or potential residential areas nor connected to streets intended for predominantly
residential traffic.
Parking areas shall be located or designed in such a manner that they are visibly secluded from
eye level in the surrounding area. Grading to depress the parking area, raised berms, landscaping
or fencing are satisfactory methods to create such seclusion.
All area, design and parking requirements shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance.
Outdoor collection stations shall be provided for garbage and trash removal when indoor collection
is not provided. Collection stations shall be located to avoid being offensive and shall be screened
from view and landscaped.
§ 22-535. Residential Development Standards.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 534]
Preliminary approval of the site plan must be obtained for the entire proposed development. Final
approval may be obtained section by section, but such development sections shall be specified on
the Preliminary Plan and must be numbered in the proposed order that they are to be developed.
Such order of development must be adhered to; and if changes are required, plans must be
refined and reviewed and approved.

Financial security in accordance with the M.P.C. shall be posted before final approval of the land
development plans and shall guarantee the improvements by the developer of the streets,
sidewalks, curbs, street lighting, street trees, drainage facilities, utilities and other facilities that the
Board of Supervisors may deem necessary.
The density, parking lot area and building requirements shall in all respects conform to the Zoning
Ordinance for residential family developments.
Access to the dwellings and circulation between buildings and other important project facilities for
vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be comfortable and convenient for the occupants. Access
and circulation for fire-fighting and other emergency equipment, moving vans, fuel trucks, garbage
collection, deliveries and snow removal shall be planned for efficient operation and convenience.
Walking distance from the main entrance of a building to a street, driveway or parking area shall
usually be less than 100 feet; exception to this standard should be reasonably justified by
compensating advantages, such as desirable views and site preservation through adaption to
topography. In no case shall the distance exceed 250 feet.
Arrangements of buildings shall be in favorable relation to the natural topography, existing
desirable planting, bodies of water, views within and beyond the site and exposure to the sun and
the other buildings on the site. The appeal and character of the site shall be preserved and
enhanced by retaining and protecting existing trees and other site features; and additional new
plant material shall be added for privacy, shade, beauty of buildings and grounds and to screen
out objectionable features as required in the Zoning Ordinance.
No multiple family building or group of attached buildings shall have a single facade which has a
length to height ratio greater than 5:1.
Outdoor collection stations shall be provided for garbage and trash removal when individual
collection is not made and indoor storage is not provided.
Collection stations shall be located so as to be separated adequately from habitable buildings to
avoid being offensive and shall be screened and landscaped but, at the same time, be
convenient for both collectors and residents.
§ 22-536. Naming of Subdivisions and Streets.
[Ord. 1988-O-196, 9/12/1988]
The name of a subdivision and the streets located within the subdivision shall be subject to the
approval of the Township and once approved, shall not be changed except with the approval of the
Township as a revision to the plans.
No subdivision or street name shall be repeated or be so similar to an existing subdivision or
street name so as to cause confusion between the names. Such potential confusion shall be a
valid cause for the Township to deny approval of a proposed name.
Streets that are extensions of existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets.
No subdivision or street shall be given a name which contains the words "Newtown Township. . . ."

During construction no mud may be tracked from the development onto the surrounding roadways
(whether or not they are dedicated), and no dust or dirt from construction operations shall be
permitted to settle on surrounding properties.
At final plan review, a written plan to prevent mud from being tracked onto surrounding roads and
to control dust shall be submitted to and shall be approved by the Township.
If mud is tracked from the development onto surrounding roads or dust or dirt generated on the
site is permitted to settle on surrounding properties in violation of this § 537 all construction on the
site may be stopped by the Newtown Township Code Enforcement Officer until the mud is
removed from the streets and until an acceptable plan is devised to prevent further mud from
being tracked onto the streets and/or until an acceptable plan is devised to control dust or dirt on
the site. Additionally, the developer may be fined pursuant to § 904(2) of this Chapter 22.
§ 22-538. Burying.
[Ord. 1987-O-168, 6/8/1987; as added by Ord. 93-O-5, § 1]
No person or entity shall bury any tree, vegetation, garbage, refuse, trash, debris, construction debris
(including, but not limited to, wood, plastic, plaster, metals, bricks and concrete, whether generated
within Newtown Township or elsewhere), or similar items, under the ground during any phrase of
construction of a subdivision or land development in Newtown Township.
Part 6. PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD)
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 22-601. Purpose.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 601]
In addition to the general goals listed in the preamble and the Community Development Objectives
of the Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Supervisors adopts the principle of Planned Residential
Development and the requirements and procedures therefore for the purpose of:
Increased flexibility in the laws governing such development in accordance with new
technology and market demands;
Procedures for efficient administration;
Encouraging more efficient allocation, regulation and maintenance by private initiative of
Common Open Space ancillary to new residential areas;
Creating opportunities for more efficient use of public facilities; and
Increased public and private amenities which clearly justify an increase in density.
§ 22-602. Administration.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 602]
The administration procedures for the application and approval of a planned residential
development shall be in accordance with Article VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Act 247, as amended, and this Chapter 22.

The administration of the procedures for application for and approval of Planned Residential
Developments shall be vested in the Board of Supervisors. The Board shall, however, refer all
Preliminary and Final Development Plans for such developments to the Planning Commission for
their review and comment.
The Planning Commission shall act as the principal agent for the Board in reviewing and
commenting on proposals for Planned Residential Development. As such, they shall receive and
review the plans and documents, particularly with reference to the criteria for design as contained
in this Chapter 22. In addition, they shall be concerned that the proposed development be in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan for Newtown Township and shall consider it in relation
to other factors as required for consideration by the Board in § 307 of this Chapter 22. The
Planning Commission may, in reviewing a Planned Residential Development, meet with the
prospective developer and informally direct whatever changes are agreed upon to obtain
compliance with the terms and spirit of this Chapter 22.
§ 22-603. Requirements.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 603]
Requirements for Planned Residential Development (PRD) shall be in accordance with the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance.
§ 22-604. Flexible Design Standards for PRD'S.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, § 604]
The Board of Supervisors in accordance with the provisions of this § 604, is authorized to alter
dimensional requirements for building spacing, front, side or rear yard lot widths, building size or
height, parking requirements, number of units in a structure, and other design standards in
Planned Residential Developments.
The burden of proof shall be upon the builder or developer wishing to have the standards varied.
The builder or developer shall submit drawings, models or plans, including alternatives as
specified by the Board of Supervisors. The builder may be required to post bond with the Board of
Supervisors to insure compliance with the decision and any conditions imposed by the Board of
Supervisors.
The Township Board of Supervisors shall review the following factors, if applicable, in evaluating
the proposed variations:
Increased privacy for residents and/or adjoining properties.
Improved usability of private open spaces associated with the individual dwelling units.
Increased common open space area or improved usability of common open space.
Improved vehicular-pedestrian circulation which serves to better protect public safety and
welfare.
Improvement in the adoption of the development to the natural topography.
Reduction of visual impact of the development from public streets.
Improved design of the dwelling units.
Greater preservation of natural resources, unusual features, or historic structures.

In no instance will an increase in gross or net density be permitted to exceed that which is
obtainable under the standard provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
Standards.
Roads. Standards for roads expressed in this Chapter 22 are intended to provide for safe and
intelligent layout of streets which can be maintained easily at minimum cost. There are
several aspects which may lead to the varying of size or design of specific streets.
Road Width. The width of roads has been established to insure adequate movement of
traffic in times of greatest parking loads. Where a road is designed so that all units face
on secondary streets or courts and where overflow off-street parking of at least 0.3
spaces per dwelling unit is provided nearby and contiguous to the roadway the road
width may be reduced. With this reduction, the width may be no less than 28 feet on
feeder streets or 20 feet on local streets.
Curbs. Curbs are used to channel water to storm sewers, protect pavement edges, and
keep vehicles off of grass. In certain cases, however, natural drainage should be
encouraged. Where topography and soils permit, roadside swales may be substituted for
curbs, provided that the alternate design:
Insures adequate means for the protection of pavement edges;
Handles storm water in a manner to insure against erosion or other conditions
detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; and
Has the approval of the Township Engineer.
Right-of-Way Width. Right-of-way width is intended to provide enough land for streets,
sidewalks, walls, and utilities. It is intended to provide an additional buffer between the
dwelling unit and the street. Where sidewalks are not run along streets, cartways are
reduced, utilities are located outside of the right-of-way, or houses will not front on the
street, a reduction in the width of the right-of-way may be permitted.
Sidewalks. Sidewalks are intended to provide a separate means of movement for
pedestrians. In doing so, the function of the sidewalk must be kept in mind. The following
provisions shall be met:
The walks shall be all-weather and easily cleared of snow;
They shall be convenient for the most frequent trips, such as children walking to school
bus stops; and
The walks shall remain as private property and the responsibility for their maintenance
shall be clearly established, such as by a homeowners' association.
In order for the Township to waive the requirement for sidewalks to be within a street
right-of-way, all the above provisions for locating sidewalks shall be met.
Building Spacing. The requirement for building spacing or side yards as they are often defined
is based on several related factors.
Privacy. The minimum building spacing requirement is intended to provide privacy within
the dwelling unit. Where windows are placed in only one of two facing walls or there are
no windows; or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows, or where the
windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy, the building
spacing may be reduced, at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors.
Light and Air. The building spacing provides one method of insuring that each room has
adequate light and air. Building spacing may be reduced at the discretion of the Board of

Supervisors where there are no windows or very small window areas, and where rooms
have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction, or where building
orientation, layout and shapes are such that adequate light and air are available.
Use. Areas between buildings are often used as service yards for storage of trash,
clotheslines, or other utilitarian purposes. Where this use is similar for adjacent buildings,
a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility spacing may be
permitted, at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors. Kitchens and garages are
suitable uses for rooms abutting such utility yards.
Front Yards. The minimum front yard is intended to provide privacy and usable yard area for
residents. In practice, however, front yards are rarely used, so that only the privacy factor is
important. Where the developer provides privacy by reducing traffic flow through street layout
such as culs-de-sac, or by screening or planting, or by facing the structure toward open space
or a pedestrian way, or through the arrangement of rooms and design of the front of the
building, it is possible to reduce the front yard requirement, at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors.
Lot Width. A minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long, narrow
buildings with inadequate privacy, light and air. There are situations as in culs-de-sac, steep
slopes or offset lots, where because of lot configuration or topography, narrow or irregular lots
provide the best possible design. Where the design is such that adequate light, air, and
privacy can be provided, especially for living spaces and bedrooms, a narrower lot width may
be permitted, at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors.
Building Size or Number of Units in Structure. These requirements are intended to prevent
monotony in developments. In fact, these requirements often prevent the land planner from
utilizing interesting types of layout and working with unique site conditions; or they lead to a
dull repetition of similar units. Where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors by presenting alternative plans that a superior and less monotonous plan will
result by granting relief from these standards, this may be done.
Height. Limitations on height are often used to regulate the light available in limited yard areas
and to prevent fire losses where inadequate fire-fighting equipment is available. For the
individual dwelling unit types, only the former is important. Where unique site conditions and
design permit height standards to be relaxed without adverse effects on light and air or
privacy, then this may be done, at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors.
Parking. Parking requirements are set for typical family situations. Only where subsidized
housing for the elderly is being built shall these standards be relaxed. Where these standards
are relaxed, the Township shall insist that adequate parking be provided at the owner's
expense if the building's use is changed. A notation to this effect shall be required on the plot
plan.
Lot Size and Coverage. The required lot area for individual dwelling units is small to
encourage the provision of housing at reasonable costs. Where larger dwellings or garages
are provided, larger lots are required. If the plan and lot layout are good and the parking
problem is properly solved, then the on-lot impervious surface ratio may be relaxed, at the
discretion of the Board of Supervisors; however, the impervious surface ratio for the total site
shall not be changed.

Preventive Remedies.
In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain appropriate actions at
law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent illegal occupancy of a
building, structure or premises. The description by metes and bound in the instrument of
transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the
seller or transferor from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further
improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a
subdivision of real property in violation of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this Part. This
authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
The owner of record at the time of such violation.
The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard
as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation.
The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of
violation without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee
had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an approval to any
such owner, vendee or lessee for the development of any such real property, the
Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable
to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
Enforcement Remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of this
chapter, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement commenced by the Township,
shall pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs plus reasonable attorney's
fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice determining
that there has been a violation, further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating this Part to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the
fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and
thereafter each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition of the defendant, may grant an order of stay, upon
cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and
judgment.

Township Engineer and complete compliance with the appropriate specifications at all steps of the
operation are necessary for ultimate acceptance by the Township.
§ 22-1002. Material.

Buildings of any type shall not be constructed in the Floodplain District except as provided for by
the section covering expansion of existing structure by variance in the Zoning Ordinance.
If the Board of Supervisors determines that only a part of the proposed plat can be safely
developed, it shall limit development to that part and shall require that development proceed
consistent with this determination.
When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the Township determines that
additional controls are required to insure safe development, it may require the developer to
impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every
deed and noted on every recorded plat.
Any structure placed on the Floodplain District shall be firmly anchored to prevent flood waters
from carrying it downstream. The Zoning Officer shall require the applicant to submit the written
opinion of a qualified registered professional engineer that the proposed structural design meets
this standard.

[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, App. II, § II-9]
All requirements of the Newtown Township Zoning Ordinance and this Chapter 22 shall apply. In
addition, where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing trees, shrubs or other
vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall consult the County Conservation District
representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and also to obtain a report on the soil
characteristics of the site so that a determination can be made as to the type and degree of
development the site may accommodate. Before undertaking any excavation or grading, the developer
shall obtain a Frontage and Storm Drainage Improvement Permit as required under the Zoning
Ordinance.
§ 22-1109. Drainage Facilities.

storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface waters without damage to
persons or property. The system shall insure drainage away from on-site waste disposal sites and
buildings.
Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors. The Township may require a
primarily underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to
accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and
regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff
onto adjacent properties.
§ 22-1110. Streets.
[Ord. -/-/1985, -/-/1985, App. II, § II-11]
The finished elevation of proposed streets shall not be more than the one foot below the Regulatory

§ 22-1203. Dedication of Land Suitable for Park and Recreation
Use to the Township.
[Ord. 1986-O-148, 1/20/1986, § 3; as amended by Ord. 1987-O-172, 12/12/1987, § 1; by Ord. 97-O-
12, 8/13/1997, § 1(A); and by Ord. 2006-O-8, 5/10/2006, § I]
The developer or applicant shall dedicate land suitable for park or recreation use to Newtown
Township, unless one of the alternatives set forth in § 1207 of this Part is approved by the
Township. The land shall not be dedicated until the completion of the necessary and agreed upon
improvements have been completed. All improvements shall be completed prior to 50% of the
homes in the subdivision being completed.
The amount and location of land to be dedicated to the Township shall bear a reasonable
relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by future residents of Newtown
Township. At a minimum, the following criteria for dedication of park and recreation areas to the
Township shall apply:
Residential Subdivision or Land Development. The amount of land to be dedicated for park
and recreational areas in residential subdivision or land developments of three or more
individual dwelling units, whether they are single family dwellings or contained within a multifamily
dwelling, shall be as follows:
Single Family Detached or Two-Family Developments. In the case of subdivisions of
single family detached or two-family dwellings, the developer shall dedicate a minimum of
3,000 square feet per dwelling unit.
Multi-Family Developments. In multi-family residential developments, the developer shall
dedicate a minimum of 3,000 square feet per residential dwelling unit.
Conversions. In the event that any building is converted to multi-family use, it will be
subject to the multi-family regulations.
Nonresidential Subdivision or Land Development. The amount of land to be dedicated for
park and recreational areas in a nonresidential subdivision or land development shall be
3,000 square feet per 4,000 square feet of floor area. For example, a 10,000 square foot
building will require 7,500 square feet of park and recreation area to be dedicated to the
Township. The types of park and recreational areas that shall be deemed suitable for
nonresidential subdivision or land developments shall include, but not be limited to:
Playing fields (baseball field, soccer field or the like, designed for active recreation,
constructed pursuant to the minimum standards of the regulatory authority, such as
Township little league).
Tennis courts.

The land dedicated to the Township for park and recreation purposes need not be a part of
the land development or subdivision. It may be located on a separate parcel of land, provided
that the Board of Supervisors determines in its sole discretion that the land being dedicated is
convenient to the subdivision or land development. In addition, the developer, with the
approval of the Township, may construct park and recreation facilities at the Township
facilities or the facilities of another developer to satisfy the requirements of this section. Park
and recreation facilities which are available to all Township residents as opposed to facilities
which are available only to the residents of a particular subdivision or land development are
encouraged.
No more than 25% of the park and recreation space may consist of floodplain areas or areas
with slopes in excess of 8%. Floodplain and steep slopes may not be used for active
recreation.
The land being dedicated for active recreation must be suitable for active recreation by
reason of its size, shape, location and topography.
The land being dedicated for passive recreation must be suitable by reason of its size, shape,
location and topography for hiking, picnicking and similar passive recreation.
In the event of a conflict between the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance and this Part as to the
amount of recreational areas which must be dedicated, this Part shall control.
When land is being dedicated, notwithstanding the foregoing, the land which is dedicated must
meet the minimum lot size for the district within which it is being dedicated.
Any land dedicated to the Township shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and
recreational facilities.
When land is dedicated, acceptance by the Township shall be by means of a signed resolution to
which a property description of the dedicated recreational area shall be attached.
Where a developer dedicates land, the acquisition value of the land plus any improvements being
placed on the land for park and recreation purposes must equal or exceed the fee in lieu of
dedication as established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors from time to time. If the value
of the fee in lieu of dedication is not met or exceeded, the developer must supply the balance of
his obligation to supply park and recreation facilities by one or more the alternatives set forth in
§ 1207, below.
§ 22-1204. Criteria for Locating Recreation Areas.
[Ord. 1986-O-148, 1/20/1986, § 4; as amended by Ord. 97-O-12, 8/13/1997, § 1(B)]
The Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors in exercising their duties regarding the
review of subdivision and land development plans shall consider the recommendations of the Park
and Open Space Committee and Recreation Board as well as the following criteria in determining
whether to approve the proposed recreation plan (which approval shall include both the use and
location of the proposed park and recreational area in an applicant's subdivision or land
development plan):

The land being dedicated shall be easily and safety accessible. For a park being dedicated to
the Township, the proposed park and recreational area shall be located in the front of the
subdivision, with direct access onto the external street to which the subdivision has access. If
the land being dedicated is being dedicated to a homeowners association, it may be located
in the interior of the subdivision in a location which is convenient to all of the residents of the
subdivision.
The geometry of the land being dedicated shall be as close to square as is reasonably
possible.
The land being dedicated shall be a single contiguous parcel.
The land being dedicated shall have suitable topography and soil conditions for use and
development as a recreation area.
The land being dedicated shall be directly accessible to essential utilities, such as sewer,
water and power. If water, sewer and power is not immediately to the proposed site, the
developer shall provide water, sewer and power to the site.
The land being dedicated shall be provided with off street parking to serve the proposed
facilities.
Sidewalks and/or a trail must be provided to the land being dedicated to allow all residents of
the subdivision to have access to the proposed park and recreation facilities.
The land being dedicated shall be in conformance with the Township's comprehensive park
and recreation plan.
Where the proposed subdivision or land development is located adjacent to existing park and
recreation facilities, the land being dedicated shall be adjacent to the existing park and
recreation facilities and shall be contiguous thereto. The land being dedicated shall be laid out
to maximize the usefulness of the combined facilities as a single unified park and recreation
facility.
§ 22-1205. Review by the Parks and Recreation Board.
[Ord. 1986-O-148, 1/20/1986, § 5]
At the same time that a subdivision plan, whether preliminary or final, is submitted to the
Township, a recreation plan shall be submitted to the Township Park and Recreation Board, who
shall review the plan (both to use and location) and make recommendations thereon in writing to
the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.
Upon recommendation of the Park and Recreation Board, the Board of Supervisors may waive or
alter any provision of this Part 12.
In certain instances the Park and Recreation Board may recommend to the Planning Commission
and the Board of Supervisors that it is impractical because of size, shape, location, access,
topography, drainage or other physical features of the land that there is no land within the
proposed subdivision which is practical for dedication to the public which can be set aside for
recreational uses because of size, access, topography or other physical characteristics. In that
event the developer shall proceed in accordance with § 1207 of this Part 12.

impractical to dedicate land to the Township for a public park as required by this Part, the
Supervisors shall required dedication to the homeowners association for the exclusive use of
the residents of the subdivision in which it is located and if the Board of Supervisors
determines that it is impractical to dedicate land to either the Township of the homeowners
association, the Supervisors shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such land
from the developer. The calculation of the fee in lieu of dedication shall be set forth in detail in
a resolution and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreation
facilities by future inhabitants of Newtown Township.
Any fee in lieu of dedication which is collected by the Township shall be used only for the
purpose of providing park and recreational facilities within Newtown Township.
A fee authorized under this subsection shall, upon its receipt by the Township, be deposited in
an interest bearing account, designated the Newtown Township Park and Recreation Fund.
Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of that account. Funds from such
accounts shall be expended only on specific recreation facilities approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
Upon request of any person who paid fees under this subsection, the Township shall refund
such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment, if the Township had
failed to utilize the fee paid for recreation purposes within three years from the date such fee
was paid unless return of the fee has been waived by agreement between the developer and
the Township.
Combination.
With the approval of the Township, the developer may utilize any combination of the
aforementioned techniques to satisfy his park and recreation obligation. However, in no
circumstances shall the total value of the acquisition of land, improvements thereon,
dedicated land, or reserved land fail to meet or exceed the value of the fee in lieu of
dedication established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors from time to time.

[Ord. 91-O-13, 11/16/1991, § 4]
The impact fee for transportation capital improvements shall be based upon the total costs of the
road improvements included in the adopted capital improvements plan within a given
transportation service area attributable to and necessitated by new development within the service
area, divided by the number of anticipated peak hour trips generated by all new development
consistent with the adopted land use assumptions and calculated in accordance with the "Trip
Generation Manual" published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, fifth or subsequent
edition which is hereby adopted by the Township, to equal a per-trip cost for transportation
improvements within the service area.
The specific impact fee for a specific new development or subdivision within the transportation
service area for road improvements shall be determined as of the date of the preliminary land
development or subdivision approval by multiplying the per peak hour trip cost established for the
transportation service area as set forth in the capital improvements plan, and as adjusted pursuant
to subsection (C) (4) of this Part, by the estimated number of peak hour trips to be generated by
the new development or subdivision using generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
Where a new nonresidential development or subdivision is proposed which deviates from the land
use assumptions resulting in increased density, intensity or trip generation, Newtown Township
may require the preparation of a special transportation study in order to determine traffic
generation or circulation for the new nonresidential development to assist in the determination of
the amount of the transportation fee for such development or subdivision. When required by
Newtown Township, the study shall be submitted prior to the imposition of an impact fee and shall
be taken into consideration by Newtown Township in increasing or reducing the amount of the
impact fee for the new development for the amount shown on the impact fee schedule adopted by
Newtown Township.
Traffic impact fees may be used for those costs incurred for improvements designated in the
Newtown Township Transportation Capital Improvements Plan which are attributable to new
development, including the acquisition of land and rights-of-way; engineering, legal and planning
costs; and all other costs which are directly related to road improvements within the transportation
service areas, including debt service.
Impact fees shall not be imposed or used for costs associated with any of the following:
Construction, acquisition, or expansion of Township facilities other than capital improvements
identified in the Newtown Township Transportation Capital Improvements Plan.
Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new capital improvements.
Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to serve existing
developments in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory
standards not attributable to new development.
Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to remedy
deficiencies in existing development or fund deficiencies in existing municipal capital
improvements resulting from a lack of adequate municipal funding over the years for
maintenance or capital construction costs.
Preparing and developing the land use assumptions, roadway sufficiency analysis and
transportation capital improvements plan, except that impact fees may be used for no more
than a proportionate amount of the cost of professional consultants incurred in preparing a
roadway sufficiency analysis of infrastructure within a specified transportation service area,
such allowable proportion to be calculated by dividing the total costs of all road improvements
in the adopted transportation capital improvement program within the transportation service
area attributable to projected future development within the service area, by the total costs of

all road improvements in the adopted transportation capital improvement program within the
specific transportation service area.
The impact fee set forth in the Capital Improvements Plan shall be adjusted annually in
accordance with the ENR (Engineering News Record) Cost index for the construction cost in
the Philadelphia area.
§ 22-1305. Administration of the Collection, Disbursement and
Accounting of Impact Fees.
[Ord. 91-O-13, 11/16/1991, § 5]
The Administration Office of the Township of Newtown shall administer the collection,
disbursement and accounting of impact fees imposed pursuant to this Part.
Any impact fee collected by a municipality pursuant to this Part shall be deposited by the Township
into an interest bearing fund account designed solely for impact fees, clearly identifying the
transportation service area from which the fee was received. Funds collected in one transportation
service area must be accounted for and expended within that transportation service area and such
funds shall be expended for that portion of the transportation capital improvements identified as
being funded by impact fees under the transportation capital improvements plan. All interest
earned on such funds shall become funds of that account. Newtown Township shall undertake an
annual accounting for any fund account containing impact fee proceeds and earned interest. Such
accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total funds collected, the source of the funds
collected, the total amount of interest accruing on such funds and the amount of funds expended
on specific transportation improvements. Notice of the availability of the results of the accounting
shall be included and polished as part of the annual audit required of the Township. A copy of the
report shall also be provided to the Newtown Township Traffic Impact Fee Advisory Committee.
§ 22-1306. Time, Method and Procedure for Payment of Impact
Fees.
[Ord. 91-O-13, 11/16/1991, § 6]
All transportation impact fees imposed under the terms of this Part shall be payable at the time of
the issuance of building permits for the applicable new development or subdivision. Newtown
Township may provide for the deposit with the Township of financial security in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of the construction of any road improvement contained in the
transportation capital improvement plan which is performed by the applicant.
All impact fees shall be paid by certified or bank check made payable to the "Township of
Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
§ 22-1307. Procedure for Issuance of Credit Against or
Reimbursement of Impact Fees.
[Ord. 91-O-13, 11/16/1991, § 7]
An applicant shall be entitle to a credit against the impact fee in the amount of the fair market
value of any land dedicated by the applicant to Newtown Township for future right-of-way,
realignment or widening of any existing roadways or for the value of any construction of road
improvements contained in the transportation capital improvements program which is performed at
the applicant's expense. The amount of such credit for any capital improvement constructed shall

be the amount allocated in the capital improvement program, including contingency factors, and
as adjusted pursuant to subsection (D)(4) of this Part for such work. The fair market value of any
land dedicated by the applicant shall be determined as of the date of the submission of the 1
development or subdivision application to the Township. Such credit shall not exceed the amount
of the then-current impact fee.
If the applicant makes such improvements for which a credit is to be granted, he must enter into
an agreement with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of any building permit. The
agreement must establish the estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for initiation and
completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement be completed to Township
and/or applicable Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards and design criteria and
such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors. The Board of
Supervisors must review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the
improvement is an improvement for which credit is available, and determine the amount of the
applicable credit for such improvement to be applied to the otherwise applicable impact fee prior to
issuance of any building permit. In no event shall the Board of Supervisors provide a credit which
is greater than the applicable impact fee. If, however, the amount the credit is calculated to be
greater than the amount of the impact fee due, the applicant may use such excess credit towards
the impact fees imposed other building permits for development on the same site and in the same
ownership; Provided, however, any such applicant shall be required to supply financial security
sufficient, in the judgment of the Township, to cover the cost of any such improvement installed by
the applicant for which credit is sought.
Impact fees previously collected by Newtown Township shall be refunded, together with earned
accrued interest thereon, to the payer of such fees from the date of payment under any of the
following circumstances:
In the event that Newtown Township terminates or completes an adopted capital
improvements plan for a transportation service area and there remains at the time of
termination or completion undispersed funds in the accounts established for that purpose,
Newtown Township shall provide written notice by certified mail to those persons who
previously paid the fees which remain undispersed of the availability of said funds for refund
of the person's proportionate share of the fund balance. The allocation of the refund shall be
determined by generally accepted accounting practices. In the event that any of the funds
remain unclaimed following one year after the notice, which notice shall be provided to the
last known address provided by the payor of the fees to Newtown Township, Newtown
Township shall transfer any funds so remaining to any other fund in Newtown Township
without any further obligation to refund said funds.
If Newtown Township fails to commence construction of any transportation service area road
improvements within three years of the scheduled construction date set forth in the
transportation capital improvements plan, any person who paid any impact fees pursuant to
that transportation capital improvements plan shall, upon written request to Newtown
Township, receive a refund of that portion of the fee attributable to the contribution for the
uncommenced road improvement, plus the interest accumulated thereon from the date of
payment.
If, upon completion of any road improvements project, the actual expenditures of the capital
project are less than 95% of the costs properly allocable to the fee paid within the
transportation service area in which the Township shall refund the pro rata difference between
the budgeted costs and the actual expenditures, including interest accumulated thereon from
the date of payment, to the person or persons who paid the impact fees for such
improvements.
If the new development for which transportation impact fees were paid is not commence prior to
the expiration of building permits issued for the new development within the time limits established
by the Newtown Building Code, or if the building permit as issued for the new development is

§ 22-1308. Additional Provisions.
[Ord. 91-O-13, 11/16/1991, § 8]
Nothing in this Part shall be deemed to alter or affect Newtown Township's existing power to
require an applicant for Township approval of any new development or subdivision from paying for
the installation of on-site improvements as provided for in the Newtown Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.
Those improvements subject to being funded by impact fees imposed pursuant to this Part, to any
road, street or highway which qualifies as a State highway or a portion of the rural State highway
system as provided in § 102 of the act of June 1, 1945 (P.L. 1242, No. 428), known as the "State
Highway Law," may be funded from impact fees in an amount not to exceed 50% of the total cost
of such improvements.
Any improvements to Federal-aid or State highways to be funded in Part by impact fees shall
require the approval of the Department of Transportation. Nothing in this Part shall be deemed to
alter or diminish the powers, duties or jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation with respect
to State highways or the rural State highway system.
The Board of Supervisors may periodically request the impact fee advisory committee appointed
pursuant to Act 209 of 1990, to review the capital improvements plan and impact fee charges and
make recommendations for revisions for subsequent consideration and adoption by the Board of
Supervisors based only on the following:
New subsequent development which has occurred in Newtown Township.
Capital improvements contained in the capital improvements plan, the construction of which
has been completed.
Unavoidable delays beyond the responsibility of Newtown Township in the construction of
capital improvements contained in the plan.

Procedure to Claim Exemption.
A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax may annually file an
exemption certificate with the political subdivision and with the person's employer affirming
that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the political subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption
certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms
from employment within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which
the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption
certificate and until otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
paragraph .B, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar
year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies,
employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the tax,
upon notification to an employer by the person or by the political subdivision that the person
has received earned income and net profits from all sources within the political subdivision
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible
for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person under
paragraph .C.
If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the tax becomes subject
to the tax for the calendar year under paragraph .B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under paragraph .B, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this paragraph, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar
year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of
a person subject to withholding of the tax under this paragraph is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the
political subdivision may pursue collection under this Part.
Except as provided in paragraph .B, it is the intent of this subsection that employers shall not
be responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.

shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Board of
Supervisors or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
§ 24-504. Duty of Employers to Collect.

with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for
him within the political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the collector.

employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the political subdivision.

payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax
assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the
calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection

engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of this section, For purposes of

school district and the municipality.

employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from
the employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee
will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence The employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the
number of political subdivision within which a person maybe employed. The political subdivision
shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the withheld
tax money to the political subdivision if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer till
not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by
the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of subsection .2 of § 503 of this Part and
this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this Part.
Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the end of each quarter
of a calendar year.

[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 202]
The Board of Supervisors of Newtown Township finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and
redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to
erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development
and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by
changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and
erosion of streambeds and stream-banks thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying
aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including minimization of
impacts of development, redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss
of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of
the residents of Newtown Township and all the people of the Commonwealth, their resources,
and the environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the
natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality, groundwater recharge, stream
baseflow and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost effective and environmentally
advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project design that
minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoids sensitive areas (i.e., stream buffers,
floodplains, steep slopes), and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural
hydrologic regime.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
Federal and State regulations require Newtown Township to implement a program of
stormwater controls. Newtown Township is required to obtain a permit for stormwater
discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Program.
Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to
pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.
§ 26-203. Purpose.
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 203]
The purpose of this Part is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare within the Neshaminy
Creek and Delaware River South Watersheds by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and
minimization of the impacts described and maximization of the benefits in § 202 of this Part
through provisions designed to:
Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the impacts on surface and
groundwater.

apply to the total proposed development even if development is to take place in stages.
Preparation and implementation of an approved stormwater management site plan is required. No
regulated activities shall commence until Newtown Township issues written approval of a
stormwater management site plan, which demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this
Part.
The applicant is required to find practicable alternatives to the surface discharge of stormwater
including alternatives to impervious surfaces, in order to prevent the degradation of waters of the
Commonwealth, and to maintain, as much as possible, the natural hydrologic regime.
The stormwater management site plan must be designed consistent with the sequencing
provisions of § 234 to ensure maintenance of the natural hydrologic regime and to promote
groundwater recharge and protect groundwater and surface water quality and quantity.
Stormwater drainage systems shall be designed and/or installed as necessary to:
Permit unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by stormwater
management facilities or open channels consistent with this Part.
To prevent erosion and to satisfactorily carry off or detain and control the release of surface
waters.
Encourage all run-off control measures to percolate the stormwater into the ground to aid in
the recharge of ground waters.
Carry surface water to the nearest adequate street, storm drain, detention basin, natural
watercourse or drainage facility.
Maintain the adequacy of the natural stream channels. Accelerated bank erosion shall be
prevented by controlling the rate and velocity of run-off discharge to these water courses, so
as to avoid increasing occurrence of stream-bank overflow.
If in the course of reviewing the stormwater management site plan, the Township determines
that off-site improvements are necessary to satisfactorily handle the stormwater from the
proposed development the developer shall be responsible for design and installation of the
off-site improvements.
Existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent property shall not be altered
in any manner which could cause property damage without permission of the affected property
owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this Part.
Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained
as diffused drainage areas, shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria in the general
direction of existing discharge, except as otherwise provided by this Part. If diffused drainage
discharge is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the applicant
must document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other
impacts will result from the concentrated discharge.
Where a development site is traversed by existing streams, drainage easements shall be provided
conforming to the line of such streams. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the
site, the applicant shall create stream buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet to either side of the
top-of-bank of the channel. The buffer area shall be maintained with and encouraged to use
appropriate native vegetation. If the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50 feet, the
buffer width may be reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If an existing buffer is
legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this
Part, the existing buffer shall be maintained.

release.
Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention facilities to handle run-off in
excess of design flows.
Storm sewers, culverts, and related installations shall be provided:
To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses and in such a manner as to protect the
natural character of the watercourses and to provided regulated discharge.
To insure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of streets.
To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent
and grade of the area drained and to prevent substantial flow of water across

Drainage structures, which drain watershed areas in excess of 1/2 square mile (320 acres), or
which have a span of eight feet or more, shall be designed for a maximum expected run-off
as calculated using the Soil Conservation Service Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds." The design storm shall be a minimum fifty-year storm. A one-hundredyear

floodplain. All necessary permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection shall be obtained for the waterway opening before final design is undertaken.
The cartway area over the bridge shall be as wide as the widest road connecting with the
bridge, or if the character of the road is expected to change for future planning, the cartway of

and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
Maximum Expected Discharge.
The maximum expected discharge (M.E.D.) shall be defined as the maximum expected
quantity of water, created by the design storm, arriving at a particular location (inlet, ditch,
etc.).
The design storm is a selected intensity of rainfall, which tends to occur once during a
specified period of years.
The Soil Conservation Service Technical Release # 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds (less than 2,000 acres)," shall be used for the calculation of the maximum
expected discharge.
The maximum expected discharge from drainage areas contributing to the storm drain pipe
system may be determined by the use of the rational equation, when the total drainage area
does not exceed 100 acres.
The rational equation is as follows: Q = cIA
Where:
Q = Maximum expected discharge in cubic feet per second.
C = Runoff factor expressed as a percent of the total water falling on an area.
I = The rate of rainfall for the time of concentration of the drainage area in inches
per hour for a given storm frequency.
A = The drainage area expressed in acres.
Consideration should be given to future land use changes in the drainage area in selecting
the "c" factor. For drainage areas containing several different types of ground cover, a
weighted value of "c" must be used.
The rational "c" values are listed in Table B-4 and B-7 in Appendix B.
Drainage Area. The extent of an individual drainage area shall be outlined on a map of
highest order available and submitted to the Township Engineer with the design calculations
for storm sewers. The plan shall also indicate the "Q" anticipated at each proposed inlet and
the slope of the street or swale used to compute the inlet capacity. Care should be taken to
assure that all areas delivering run-off to the point under consideration shall be included.
Additional design criteria for specific drainage facilities are required as follows:
Inlets.
When there is a change in pipe size in the inlet, the elevation for the top of pipes should
be the same or the smaller pipe higher. A minimum drop of two inches should be
provided in the inlet between the lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe
invert elevation.
If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed median section exceeds
the assumed inlet capacities, the inlet capacities shall govern the spacing of inlets.
If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section, or depressed median section is less
than the inlet capacities, then the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed section
capacity shall govern the spacing of inlets.
Type C Inlets.

Type M and S Inlets.
Type S Inlets are designated for installation in shoulder swale areas with back slopes
6:1 and steeper. Type M Inlets are designated to be used in swale areas where the
back slope is flatter than 6:1.
The capacity of an inlet at a low point in the swale (sump condition) is at eight cfs
maximum.
§ 26-232. Permit Requirements by Other Government Entities.
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 219]

Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the appropriate
DEP regional office or the Bucks County Conservation District must be provided to Newtown
Township. The issuance of an NPDES stormwater permit for construction activities or permit under
the Statewide general permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required permit, as required by DEP
regulations, shall be available on the project site at all times.
Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria are recommended to be
applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed. They shall include the following:
Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction
during the construction phase to maintain maximum infiltration capacity. Barriers such as
construction fencing should be used to protect and keep construction traffic out of the area
where infiltration BMPs are proposed. Inlet or pipes that are installed to these systems should
be completely sealed or protected and monitored until the drainage areas are completely
stabilized.
Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire contributory
drainage area to the infiltration BMP has achieved final stabilization, or as approved by the
Engineer.
General Performance Standards.
Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall, as a minimum, meet the
standards and specifications of the Bucks County Conservation District. In cases where the
Bucks County Conservation District does not have standards and specifications for erosion
and sedimentation control, other known and commonly accepted standards and specifications
may be used as approved by the Township Engineer.
The following measures to minimize erosion and sedimentation shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
Stripping of vegetation, re-grading, or other development shall be done in a way that will
minimize erosion.
Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep fill operations to a
minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as to create the least erosion
potential and adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water run-off.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum, but
shall not exceed 60 days.
Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical, but within a time not to exceed
90 days.
Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect exposed critical areas
during development.
The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control and drainage shall be
installed as soon as practical in the development.

Sediment in the run-off water shall be trapped until the disturbed area is stabilized by the
use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures.
Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping of vegetation, regrading or other
development, it shall be the responsibility of the person, corporation of other entity causing
such sedimentation to remove it from all affected surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses on and off-site, and to repair any damage at his expense as quickly as possible.
It is the responsibility of any person, corporation, or entity doing any work on or across a
stream, watercourse, or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-of-way during the period of the
work, to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
No person, corporation, or other entity shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any
structure or deposit any material or thing or perform any work which will affect normal or flood
flow in any stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the Township
and/or the Department of Environmental Protection, whichever is applicable.
Each person, corporation, or other entity which makes any surface changes shall be required
to:
Collect on-site surface run-off and control it to a point of discharge into the natural
watercourse of the drainage area.
Handle existing off-site run-off through the development by designing it to adequately
handle all upstream run-off.
Provide and install at their expense, in accordance with Township requirements, all
drainage and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent) as required by
the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.
Site Grading for Erosion Control. In order to provide more suitable sites for building and other
uses, improve surface drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from buildings and
dispose of it without ponding, and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and
dispose of surface water without ponding, except where ponding (detention basins, etc.) is
part of the stormwater management plan for the site.
Concentration of surface water run-off shall be permitted only in swales, watercourses, or
detention basins. Subject to the approval of the Township Engineer, swales shall be sodded,
utilize jute matting, or other similar measures to insure proper growth of the ground cover.

§ 26-234. Nonstructural Project Design (Sequencing to Minimize
Stormwater Impacts).
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 221]
The design of all regulated activities shall include the following to minimize stormwater impacts:
The applicant shall find practicable alternatives to the surface discharge of stormwater, the
creation of impervious surfaces and the degradation of waters of the Commonwealth, and
must maintain as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of the site.
An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of implementation after taking into
consideration existing technology and logistics in light of overall project purposes, and other
Township requirements.
All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are presumed to have less adverse
impact on quantity and quality of waters of the Commonwealth unless otherwise
demonstrated.
The applicant shall demonstrate that the regulated activities were designed in the following
sequence. The goal of the sequence is to minimize the increases in stormwater runoff and impacts
to water quality resulting from the proposed regulated activity:
The stormwater calculations shall show on plans or list in the narrative all environmentally
sensitive areas including, but not limited to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands,
hydric soils, vernal pools, stream buffers, hydrologic soil groups, any existing recharge areas,
potential infiltration areas or permeable soil area and other requirements outlined in the
Newtown Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22].
Prepare a project layout avoiding sensitive areas identified in subsection (2)(A).
Identify site specific existing conditions drainage areas, discharge points, recharge areas and
hydrologic soil groups A and B (areas conducive to infiltration).
Evaluate Nonstructural Stormwater Management Alternatives.
Minimize earth disturbance.
Minimize impervious surfaces.

Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final design that meets the
management district requirements.
Manage any remaining runoff prior to discharge, through detention, bioretention, direct
discharge or other structural control.
§ 26-235. Volume Control.
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 222]
Volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect stream channel morphology,
maintain groundwater recharge, and contribute to water quality improvements. Stormwater runoff
volume control methods are based on the net change in runoff volume for the two-year storm
event.
Volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in subsection (A) or the
simplified method in subsection (B) below. For regulated activities equal to or less than one acre,
this Part establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations of the
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors. All regulated activities greater
than one acre must use the design-storm method.
Design-Storm Method (Any Regulated Activity). This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions. For modeling assumptions refer to § 237.
Post-development total runoff should not be increased from pre-development total runoff
for all storms equal to or less than the two year twenty-four hour duration precipitation.
The following must be used in order to estimate the increased volume of runoff for the
two year twenty-four hour duration precipitation event:
To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site conditions (pre-development)
and for the proposed developed site conditions (post-development), it is recommended to
use the soil cover complex method as shown on the following page. Table B-3 in
Appendix B is available to guide a qualified professional and/or an applicant to calculate
the stormwater runoff volume. The calculated volume shall be either reused,
evapotranspired, or infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Soil Cover Complex Method:
Step 1: Runoff (in) = Q =
(P-0.2S)
(P + 0.8S) where
P = 2-year Rainfall (in)
S =
(1000)
(CN)
- 10, the potential maximum retention
(including initial abstraction, 1a)
Step 2: Runoff Volume (Cubic Feet) = Q x Area x 1/12
Q = Runoff (in)
Area = SWM Area (sq ft)

Simplified Method (Regulated activities less than or equal to one acre):
Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
Volume (cubic feet) = (2" runoff/12 inches) X impervious surface (sq. ft.)
At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface
waters of the Commonwealth. The calculated volume shall be either reused,
evapotranspired or infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Volume (cubic feet) = (1" runoff/12 inches) X impervious surface (sq. ft.)
Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the 0.5 inch of the permanently
removed runoff.
No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious surfaces shall be released from
the site. The release time must be over 24 to 72 hours.
Stormwater Control Measures. The applicant must demonstrate how the required volume is
controlled through stormwater best management practices (BMPs) which shall provide the
means necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the total runoff volume.
If natural resources exist on the site, the applicant is required to determine the total
acreage of protected area where no disturbance is proposed. The acreage of the
protected area should be subtracted from the total site area and not be included in the
stormwater management site area acreage used in determining the volume controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area =
{Total Site Area (for both pre and post development conditions) - Protected Area}
Natural resource areas should be calculated based upon the Newtown Township Zoning
Ordinance. See Table B-2 in Appendix B for guidance to assess the total protected
area. For additional reference see Chapter 5, § 5.4.1 of the PA BMP manual.
Calculate the volume controls provided through non-structural BMPs. Table B-5 in
Appendix B is recommended as guidance.
Volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs should be subtracted from the
required volume to determine the necessary structural BMPs.
Required Volume Control (ft )  Nonstructural
Volume Control (ft )  Structural Volume
Requirement (ft )
Calculate the volume controls provided through structural BMPs. Table B-6 in Appendix B
is recommended as guidance. See PA BMP Manual Chapter 6 for description of the
BMPs.
Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based
on the suitability of soils and site conditions (see Table B-6 in Appendix B for a list of
Infiltration BMPs), Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the infiltration BMPs and
the top of bedrock or seasonally high water table.

An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load and dewater
completely as determined by field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inches/hour (in/hr) should
be utilized and for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50% should be applied for
design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured four-tenths in/hr, the BMP design
should use two-tenths in/hr to insure safe infiltration rates after construction).
All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely infiltrate runoff
volume within three days (72 hours) from the start of the design storm.
Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the suitability of
infiltration facilities. All regulated activities are required to perform a detailed soils
evaluation by a qualified design professional which at minimum address' soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general process for designing
the infiltration BMP shall be:
Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within the
site to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical
investigations of sub-grade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic conductivity tests (at
the level of the proposed infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate.
Design the infiltration structure based on field determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface and based on the safety factor of 50%.
If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be demonstrated to the Township
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the possibility of
groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the Township.
§ 26-236. Stormwater Peak Rate Control and Management
Districts.
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 223]
The Neshaminy Creek Watershed has been divided into two stormwater management districts in
Newtown Township (District A and District B) as shown on the Peak Rate Control Management
District Map in Appendix D. The Delaware River South Watershed contains only one stormwater
management district. The release rate requirements for the Neshaminy Creek Watershed District
'A' and the Delaware River South Watershed District 'A' are the same.
Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River
South Watersheds for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year design storms
are shown in Table 236.1. Development sites located in each of the Management Districts must
control proposed development conditions runoff rates to existing conditions runoff rates for the
design storms in accordance with Table 236.1.

General. Proposed conditions rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the peak
release rates of runoff from existing conditions for the design storms specified on the Peak Rate
Control Management District Map (Appendix D) and in this Section of this Part.
District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on official
maps and are available for inspection at the Township office and County planning offices. A copy
of the map at a reduced scale with zoomed-in extents is included in Appendix D. The exact
location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours (or
most accurate data required) provided as part of the SWM site plan.
Sites Located in More than One District. For a proposed development site located within two or
more stormwater management district category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any
subarea shall meet the management district criteria for the district in which the discharge is
located.
Off-Site Areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates, developers do not have to
account for runoff draining into the subject development site from an off-site area. On-site
drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
Site Areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area subject to the management
district criteria. Non-impacted areas or non-regulated activities bypassing the stormwater
management facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
Alternate Criteria for Redevelopment Sites. For redevelopment sites, one of the following minimum
design parameters shall be accomplished, whichever is most appropriate for the given site
conditions as determined by Newtown Township:
Meet the full requirements specified by Table 236.1 and subsections (1) through (6); or,
Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20% based upon a comparison of
existing impervious surface to proposed impervious surface.

§ 26-237. Calculation Methodology.
[Ord. 2011-O-2, 5/25/2011, § 225]
The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground cover used to determine
the existing conditions runoff volume and flow rate shall be as follows:
Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good condition." A site is classified
as wooded if a continuous canopy of trees exists over a 1/4 acre.
The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare earth, and fallow ground
shall be considered as "meadow in good condition," unless the natural ground cover
generates a lower curve number (CN) or rational "c" value (i.e., woods) as listed in Tables
B-4 or B-7 in Appendix B of this Part.
For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used to determine the existing
conditions runoff volume and flow rate for the developed portion of the site shall be based
upon actual land cover conditions. If the developed site contains impervious surfaces, 20% of
the impervious surface area shall be considered meadow in the model for existing conditions.
Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a drainage area of greater than
200 acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation technique that is based on
the NRCS soil cover complex method. Table 237-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods
and the method selected by the design professional shall be based on the individual limitations
and suitability of each method for a particular site. Newtown Township may allow the use of the
rational method (Q=CIA) to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than
200 acres.
Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (cfs)
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover
I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour
A = Drainage Area, acres.

Other methods Varies Other computation methodologies
approved by Newtown Township
and/or the Township Engineer.
All calculations consistent with this Part using the soil cover complex method shall use the
appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms according to NOAA Atlas
14, rain data corresponding to the Doylestown rain gauge, seen in Table B-1 in Appendix B. The
SCS Type II rainfall curve from NOAA is found on Figure B-1 in Appendix B. This data may also
be directly retrieved from the NOAA Atlas 14 website. If a hydrologic computer model such as
PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall
shall be 24 hours.
All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall intensities consistent with appropriate
times-of-concentration for overland flow and return periods from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2,
Version 2.1. Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology
presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or
replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times-of-concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's equation.
Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to be used in the soil cover
complex method shall be obtained from Table B-4 in Appendix B.
Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use in the rational method
shall be obtained from Table B-7 in Appendix B.
The designer shall consider that the runoff from proposed sites graded to the subsoil will not have
the same runoff conditions as the site under existing conditions because of the soil compaction,
even after topsoiling or seeding. The designer may increase his proposed condition "CN" or "c" by
5% to better reflect proposed soil conditions.
The Manning equation is preferred for one-dimensional, gradually-varied open channel flow. In
other cases, appropriate, applicable methods should be applied; however, early coordination with
Newtown Township is necessary.
Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance
standards of this Part using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance standards of
this Part shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the
storage-indication method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph. Newtown Township may approve the use of any generally
accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that uses a total runoff volume that is consistent
with the volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.

enclosures), and any work involving wetlands governed by DEP Chapter 105 regulations (as
amended or replaced from time to time by DEP), shall be designed in accordance with Chapter
105 and will require a permit from DEP.
Any other drainage conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations, other
than storm sewers, must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or roadway,
runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured
below the lowest point along the top of the roadway or embankment. Any facility that constitutes a
dam as defined in DEP Chapter 105 regulations may require a permit under dam safety
regulations. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements. Roadway crossings located within
designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm.
Storm sewers must be able to convey proposed conditions runoff from a twenty-five-year design
storm without surcharging inlets, where appropriate.
Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels, and at all points of

It is the responsibility of any person, corporation, or entity doing any work on or across a
stream, watercourse, or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-of-way during the period of the
work, to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
No person, corporation, or other entity shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any
structure or deposit any material or thing or perform any work which will affect normal or flood
flow in any stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the Township
and/or Department of Environmental Protection, whichever is applicable.
Each person, corporation or other entity which makes any surface changes shall be required
to:
Collect on-site surface run-off and control it to a point of discharge into the natural
watercourse of the drainage area.
Handle existing off-site run-off through his development by designing it to adequately
handle all upstream run-off.

No regulated activities within Newtown Township shall commence until approval by Newtown
Township of a stormwater management site plan that describes how the permanent (e.g., postconstruction)
stormwater controls and BMPs will be properly operated and maintained.
The owner of any land upon which permanent stormwater facilities and BMPs will be placed,
constructed or implemented, as described in the stormwater management site plan, shall record
the following documents in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds for Bucks County, within 15 days
of approval of the stormwater management site plan by Newtown Township:
Operations and maintenance agreements.
Easements.
Newtown Township may suspend or revoke any approvals granted for the project site upon
discovery of failure on the part of the owner to comply with this Section.
The stormwater management site plan for the project site shall establish responsibilities for the
continuing operation and maintenance of all stormwater facilities and BMPs, as follows:
If a plan includes structures or lots which are to be separately owned and in which streets,
sewers and other public improvements are to be dedicated to Newtown Township, stormwater
facilities and BMPs may also be offered for dedication to and maintained by Newtown
Township. If the Township does not accept dedication of the BMPs, the owner, homeowners
association or private management entity shall be responsible for the continued operation and
maintenance of the BMPs.
Newtown Township shall make the final determination on the continuing operations and
maintenance responsibilities. Newtown Township reserves the right to accept or reject the
operations and maintenance responsibility for any or all of the stormwater controls and BMPs.

Where stormwater or surface water will be gathered, discharged or drained over lands within or
beyond the boundaries of the subdivision or land development, or within a proposed regulated
activity site, the applicant or owner shall reserve or obtain easements over all lands affected
thereby, provided that no easement or right-of-way for drainage purposes exists on such affected
land. Such easements shall be adequate for such discharge of drainage and for the carrying off of
such water and for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the same, including the right of
passage over and upon the same by vehicles, machinery and other equipment for such purposes,
and which shall be of sufficient width for such passage and work and that would provide ingress to
and egress from a public right-of-way. The width of the easement shall be determined by the
Township Engineer, but in no case be less than 20 feet in width. The owner shall convey, free of
charge or cost, such easements to the Township upon demand.
Stormwater management easements shall be provided by the property owner, if necessary, for:
Access for inspections and maintenance.
Preservation of stormwater runoff conveyance, infiltration and detention areas and other
BMPs, by persons other than the property owner. The purpose of the easement shall be
specified in any agreement under § 262.
All easements shall be fully described with metes and bounds on the BMP operations and
maintenance plan.
§ 26-264. As-Built Plans.

Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of a district as
indicated on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
§ 305. Statements of Purpose and Intent for the Districts.
[Amended effective 10/2/2006 by JMZO Ord. 2006-09, § 1; adopted
9/27/2006, Amended effective 10/30/2006 by JMZO Ord. 2006-18,

A. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately coinciding
with the center lines of streets, highways, railroad lines, or streams,
such center lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
B. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said
boundaries; or where district boundaries are extensions of lot lines or
connect the intersections of lot lines, such lines shall be said district
boundaries.
C. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to center lines of streets or highways, such district boundaries
shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map.
D. Section 304.A takes precedence over § 304.B, which takes precedence
over § 304.C.
A. Jericho Mountain District (JM). The Jericho Mountain District consists
of an area within the Region with limited development potential due to
steep slopes, poor suitability for on-lot sewer systems, high soil erosion
potential, and extremely limited ground-water availability. For these
reasons development is limited to single-family detached development
on large lots for scattered-type development and cluster-type
development, provided that individual on-lot waste disposal systems are
utilized in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of the Participating
Municipality where building or development is proposed.
B. Conservation Management (CM). The Conservation Management
District consists of valuable natural resources such as woodlands,
agricultural soils, floodplains, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, and
areas of steep slopes. The Conservation Management District is
dependent on groundwater as the primary water source. Agriculture is
a significant and an important use of land in the Conservation
§ 303 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:29
Management District. For these reasons, uses are permitted in both
type and intensity which provide the maximum opportunities for open
space in order to protect the natural resources and encourage the
continuation of farming activities. Single-family detached, single-family
detached cluster, and performance subdivisions are permitted,
provided sewage disposal methods shall replenish the water table in
accordance with the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal
Comprehensive Plan and the Sewage Facilities Plan (Act 537) of the
participating municipality where building or development is proposed.
The use and ownership of open space within residential developments
shall be designed to achieve the purposes noted above and to be
compatible with other uses in the Conservation Management District.
C. Country Residential/Low Density (CR-1). The Country Residential/Low
Density District is intended to promote the maintenance of existing low
density neighborhoods in the rural areas adjacent to the Region's
villages while providing the opportunity for future infill development at
similar intensities. In addition to the existing single-family detached
dwelling units, single-family detached cluster and performance
subdivisions are permitted in order to insure the protection of the
environmental resources within the district. All wastewater disposal
shall utilize methods that shall replenish the water table in accordance
with the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan
and the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building or
development is proposed.
D. Country Residential/Medium Density (CR-2). The Country Residential/
Medium Density District is intended to accommodate medium density
development within the villages located in the more rural areas of the
Region. Single-family detached, single-family cluster, and performance
subdivisions are permitted to insure the protection of the
environmental resources of the district and to provide open space for
recreation. All wastewater disposals shall utilize methods that shall
replenish the water table in accordance with the wastewater policies of
the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan and the Act 537 Plan of the
Participating Municipality where building or development is proposed.
E. Residential/Medium Density (R-1). The Residential/Medium Density
District is intended to promote the maintenance of existing mediumdensity
neighborhoods that are already served by public sewer and
water, while providing the opportunity for single-family detached,
single-family cluster, and mixed dwelling development at higher
densities in a Performance Subdivision. This district is adjacent to the
high-density districts that are adjacent to the Borough of Newtown and
the regional shopping center where municipal services are mostly
available. Areas within this district are suitable for single-family
detached with or without on-lot sewer and water and Performance
Subdivision mixed dwelling developments. Except for single-family
detached uses, all such uses shall be served by a franchised water
company and sewer facility in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of the
§ 305 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 305
I:30
Participating Municipality where building or development is proposed.
[Amended effective 9/23/2018 by JMZO Ord. No. 2017-04,
adopted 9/18/2018.]
F. Residential/High Density (R-2). The Residential/High Density District is
intended to provide higher-density development in those areas near
major highways, commercial areas, and/or centers of employment.
Single-family detached, single-family detached cluster and Performance
Subdivision mixed dwelling development at high densities are
permitted. Restrictions are provided to maintain suitable areas of open
space. Except for single-family detached uses, all such uses shall be
served by a franchised water company and sewer facility in accordance
with the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building
or development is proposed. [Amended effective 9/23/2018 by JMZO
Ord. No. 2017-04, adopted 9/18/2018.]
G. Village Residential/Low Density (VR-1). The Village Residential/Low
Density District is intended to provide design standards and use
regulations for the older villages or neighborhoods that were built prior
to the advent of municipal planning and zoning. Single-family detached
dwelling units are permitted on larger lots.
H. Village Residential/Mixed Development (VR-4). The Village Residential/
Mixed Development is intended to provide design standards and use
regulations for the older villages and hamlets that were built prior to
the advent of municipal planning and zoning. Single-family detached
dwelling units and limited commercial and office uses are permitted on
large lots. All wastewater disposal shall be provided in accordance with
the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan and
the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building or
development is proposed.
I. Professional Service (PS). The intent of the Professional Service
Districts is to provide reasonable standards for the harmonious
development of professional and governmental offices, which are
compatible with adjacent residential uses within the villages.
J. Office Research (OR). The intent of the Office Research District is to
provide for special office and research, industrially related uses on
large tracts of land, which will provide a major employment center for
the Region while enhancing its open space characteristics and natural
features. Design standards avoid adverse impacts and encourage high
quality development which will relate compatibly to adjacent
residential areas. However, due to the increased level of traffic and
consideration of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
Interim low density uses such as various agricultural activities shall
also be permitted.
K. Professional Service (PS-2). The intent of the Professional Service-2
District is to provide reasonable standards for the harmonious
development of professional and business offices which are compatible
§ 305 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:31
with existing residential uses within the District and with surrounding
residential and non-residential uses which have been developed around
the District.
L. Village Commercial-1 (VC-1). In the Village Commercial-1 Districts, the
intent is to provide for small neighborhood commercial areas within the
major villages. There are three types of new development that can
occur within these centers: (1) development of a tract for a single use,
(2) development of a tract for a variety of uses, and (3) conversion of a
single structure into a new single use. When the land area of this
district has been fully developed, the future expansion of this district
shall be directly adjacent thereto and limited to an increase of 20% of
this District.
M. Village Commercial-2 (VC-2). The purposes of the Village Commercial-2
Districts are to achieve the type and scale of village development as
identified for the Village Commercial-1 Districts while providing for
certain automotive service uses and appropriate use criteria. VC-2
Districts are established to recognize the rural character and
commercial nature at certain designated intersections of principal
arterial roadways.
N. Convenience Commercial (CC). The purpose of Convenience
Commercial Districts is to provide reasonable standards for the orderly
development of highway-oriented businesses and commercial uses. Due
to the nature of their activities, these uses must be appropriately
located with adequate street frontage along major roads in order to be
coordinated into an overall plan which avoids undue congestion of the
streets. For this reason, most uses are conditional.
O. Planned Commercial (PC). The intent of the Planned Commercial
District is to provide for a cohesive unit of commercial stores with
transportation facilities that are arranged and constructed according to
a master plan that will provide the major commercial needs of the
Region. Because of the concentration of substantial retail activity,
increased levels of traffic, consideration of access and safety control,
large areas of parking, and the flow of pedestrian traffic, most uses are
conditional in order to insure adequate design, access, and traffic
controls and in order to insure that this area will blend with adjoining
uses and function as an asset to the region.
P. Town Commercial (TC). The intent of the Town Commercial District is to
provide a commercial area with pedestrian access and visual impact.
The uses and the regulations are intended to encourage vitality in the
commercial area through allowance of a mix of activities and uses.
Requirements for design and inclusion of public spaces will make the
area attractive to pedestrians and a destination for people outside the
area. The district requirements are designed to discourage those uses
or standards which generate large amounts of traffic and which are not
in keeping with the architectural and historic commercial area or that
would threaten the human-scale pedestrian friendliness of the area.
§ 305 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 305
I:32
Public space is an important component of the TC District. [Amended
effective 10/15/2012 by JMZO Ord. 2012-01, adopted 10/10/
2012.]
Q. Town Commercial (TC-2). The intent of the TC-2 Town Commercial-2
District is to provide a mixed use area at the entrance to the Township
that allows for residential and nonresidential uses, conversion of
residences to low-impact nonresidential uses, and a visual style
Community.
R. Rural Industrial (RI). The intent of the Rural Industrial District is to
provide for low-intensive industrial uses in those portions of the Region
where sewer facilities and water are not provided. In order to insure
that the uses are free from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odors,
glare, hazards of fire, or other objectionable effects such as extensive
use of water, and because of the increased levels of traffic and
consideration of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
S. Light Industrial (LI). The purpose of the Light Industrial District is to
provide a wide range of industrially-related uses which will provide a
major employment center for the Region while enhancing its open
space characteristics and natural features. Design standards avoid
adverse impacts and encourage high quality development which will
relate compatibly to adjacent residential areas. Wastewater
management shall be provided in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of
the Participating Municipality where building or development is
proposed. In order to insure that the uses are free from offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, odors, glare, hazards of fire, or other objectionable
effects and because of the increased levels of traffic and consideration
of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
T. Quarry/Agricultural (QA). The intent of the Quarry/Agricultural District
is to provide for safe and efficient quarrying operations. Upon
completion of such operation, including all reclamation, the
municipality shall determine the feasibility of rezoning this district to a
residential district.
U. Rural Industrial (RI-A). The intent of the Rural Industrial (RI-A) District
is to serve the same purposes as those stated for the Rural Industrial
(RI) District and to provide appropriate locations for recycling and
refuse facility uses.
U.1. Office-Light Industrial (O-LI). The purpose of the Office-Light Industrial
District is to provide for a variety of office and industrial uses that will
complement the Light Industrial District. Design and intensity
standards are intended to avoid adverse impacts and encourage high
quality development which will relate compatibly to adjacent
residential and nonresidential areas. In order to insure that the uses are
free from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odors, glare, hazards of fire,
or other objectionable effects and because of the increased levels of
§ 305 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:33
traffic and consideration of access and safety control, most uses are
permitted as conditional uses.
V. Municipal Services (MS). The Municipal Services District is intended to
provide for adequate areas and appropriate standards for municipal
services facilities needed to accommodate the local government
activities of the participating municipalities.
W. Educational, Institutional and Recreational District (EIR). The
Educational, Institutional and Recreational District is intended to
provide for adequate areas and appropriate standards for major
governmental and nongovernmental uses and activities that serve the
Newtown Area and the greater region. Such uses require larger land
areas, but provide for substantial open areas in a recreational or
campus setting.
X. Park and Open Space District (POS). The Park and Open Space District
is intended to recognize major land parkland by governmental bodies
and other entities who have reserved the land from developed uses.
Y. Federal Cemetery Overlay District (FCO). The Federal Cemetery
Overlay District is an overlay zone upon the Conservation Management
District and a portion of the R-2 District, recognizing the designation of
the National Veterans Cemetery in Upper Makefield Township, the
existing Historic Village of Dolington, the transfer of residential density
from the cemetery site to an area adjacent to a school use area, and the
coordination of water and sewer facilities throughout the district. In
lieu of the Conservation Management District agricultural soils
requirements, upon acquisition of the land for a Federal Cemetery, the
FCO permits two Residential Development Areas, an Age-Qualified
Housing Area, a School Use Area, an Open Space Area, and the creation
of the National Veterans Cemetery as a buffer to the Historic Village of
Dolington.
Z. Quarry/Agricultural - A (QA-A). The intent of the Quarry/Agricultural - A
is to, in addition to the previously established purposed of the Quarry/
Agricultural District, provide for a safe location for the sale of consumer
fireworks.
AA. Municipal Services Agriculture District (MSA). The Municipal Services
Agriculture District is intended to provide adequate areas and
appropriate standards for municipal service facilities needed to
accommodate the local government activities within Wrightstown
Township; to promote agriculture within the municipality by providing
opportunities for goods to be produced and sold on an approximately 12
acre portion of a 62.6 acre tract on the eastern side of Second Street
Pike, between Penns Park Road and Swamp Road, known as Chippewa
Farm and identified as Tax Map Parcel No. 53-12-18 (as of September
22, 2010, the date of adoption of this Ordinance); and to provide for the
protection, renovation, restoration, and/or adaptive reuse of buildings
and structures on Municipal Open Space within the MSA District.

gathering place and center for the community. Examples of public
spaces are:
Plazas
Seating areas
Outdoor eating areas
Public spaces must be visible from and accessible from Sycamore
Street, except for any public spaces located along Newtown Creek,
in which case they must be accessible from Sycamore Street but
not necessarily visible from the street. Properties on the east side
of Sycamore Street that abut Newtown Creek are encouraged to
use the creek as all or part of any required public space. Access to
Newtown Creek may be designed as a natural area, walking path,
building entrance, or outdoor eating area. Access to Newtown
Creek is an option that is encouraged but that is not required.
3. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide as opposed to the
Township ordinance requirements (as required by this Ordinance
or by the Subdivision/Land Development Ordinance).
§ 603 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 603
I:89
4. Parking.
a. Parking for the following uses in the TC District may be
reduced, at the option of the Board of Supervisors, when a fee

TC  Town Commercial District.
c. Where two or more adjacent property owners agree to share
parking and access improvements, in a manner approved by
the Board of Supervisors, to ensure adequate improvements
are provided and the requirements of this Ordinance and those
of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance will be
met, the requirement for two off-street parking spaces shall be
eliminated or a new curb cut (access point) is avoided. In
addition, the requirements for two off-street parking spaces
shall be eliminated for each other property where a curb cut
(access point) is provided to facilitate the shared parking and

impede the flow of vehicular traffic on the site. Seasonal farmers'
markets shall be permitted.
8. Required Design Review.
a. In accordance with Section 605 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code,15 the TC District is declared a
special area as a major thoroughfare and an area of unique
historical and architectural interest and is hereby designated
as an area requiring design review by the Township.
b. No structure or improvement on any land within the TC
District shall be made until the plans for the exterior
architectural features, signs, parking and vehicular and
pedestrian access, and landscaping have been reviewed and
approved by the Board of Supervisors. The review shall not be
required for regular maintenance of a structure, painting, or
exterior color changes. Properties within the TC District and
also within the designated Historic District shall be subject to
review by the Historic Architectural Review Board. The Board
of Supervisors may consult with the HARB for properties
within the TC District that are outside the Historic District, but
the Historic District procedures shall not be applied in that
case.
c. No specific architectural style shall be imposed on applicants.
Factors to be considered by the Board of Supervisors are:
(1) If a lot is being redeveloped, can the existing structures be
used? Preference is given to the reuse of existing
structures rather than removal and building new
structures.
(2) Franchise architecture, used by national or chain
companies, is discouraged in favor of reusing existing
building or designs that reflect the architecture of
Sycamore Street. Use of design, materials, color, lighting,
texture, mass or roofline designed to serve as an
advertisement or commercial display do not meet the
standards of the Township and shall not be approved.
Franchise logos may be included in signage that meets
ordinance requirements.

A. General.
1. The natural resource restrictions, herein, shall apply to all uses.
2. Site alterations, regrading, filling, or clearing of vegetation prior to
approval of final plan by the governing body shall be a violation of
this Ordinance. However, this Section shall not prohibit any land
management practices that may be necessary for the ecological
improvement of any stream, pond, lake, or wetland or for forest
production, provided that all applicable permits have been
obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.
B. Requirements for All Uses.
1. Floodplain and Floodplain Soils. All such lands shall remain as open
space. No structures, filling, piping, diverting, or stormwater
detention basins shall be permitted within the floodplain unless
permitted pursuant to the Floodplain Ordinance of the respective
municipality where the property is located. [Amended effective
12/9/2017 by JMZO Ord. No. 2015-02, adopted 12/4/2017.]
2. Lakes, Ponds, Wetlands, and Waters of the Commonwealth.
a. These areas shall remain as open space. No development,
filling, piping, or diverting shall be permitted.
b. Wetland Transition Area.
(1) In order to minimize the adverse impacts of human
activity; to prevent groundwater contamination; to reduce
surface run-off and sedimentation; to protect the
hydrology of the wetland; and to protect wildlife habitats,
a Wetland Transition Area shall be established in the
Jericho Mountain (JM), Conservation Management (CM),
Country Residential/Low Density (CR-1), Country
Residential/Medium Density (CR-2) and Village
Commercial-1 (VC-1). This transition area shall be
§ 902 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:251
established as a buffer extending from the outer limit
of the wetlands as defined in this Ordinance a minimum
distance of 50 feet,. Where sensitive site features warrant
additional protection, the Wetland Transition Area shall be
extended in accordance with the most restrictive of the
following conditions:
(a) Where the 300 feet of land adjacent to the outer limit
of the wetlands has an average upland slope in excess
of 10%, the Wetland Transition Area shall be increased
by four feet for each degree of slope above 10%,
however, in no case shall the Wetland Transition Area
exceed 100 feet.
(b) Where wetlands support wildlife on the PNDI list and
plant life species as identified therein, the Wetland
Transition Area shall be increased to 100 feet, and
there shall not be any disturbance within 50 feet of the
wetland transition area. It shall be presumed that the
wetlands support wildlife and plant life species
identified on the PNDI list, unless the applicant or
property owner provides a habitat suitability
assessment showing: 1) that the species do not reside
within the transition area, and 2) that the transition
area is not suitable as habitat of the species.
(2) Where in the opinion of the Township, disturbance to the
shape, but not the square footage, of a Wetland Transition
Area on a tract or parcel of land will mitigate the
environmental impact or result in minimal environmental
impact, and the modified transition area continues to serve
the transition function, the width of the Wetland Transition
Area may be reduced to 50% of its required width, so long
as it is compensated by increasing the transition area
width in another portion of the same wetland area on the
same site, and the total required Wetland Transition Area
square footage is not reduced. In no event shall more than
20% of the Wetland Transition Area be disturbed or
stripped of its vegetation. There shall be no disturbance
within 50 feet of a delineated wetlands which supports
plant and wildlife identified on the PNDI list of a wetland
be disturbed and 25 feet of all other delineated wetlands.
(3) The following activities are permitted in Wetland
Transition Areas:
(a) The Wetland Transition Areas shall remain in a natural
state, but pruning of existing vegetation, planting of
native vegetation, and removal of invasive species
subject to compliance with the restrictions listed in
this Ordinance shall be permitted.
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:252
(b) Streets and driveway crossings, that do not disturb
more than .1 acre (one-tenth of an acre) of the
transition area within the tract or parcel, and for
which compensation is provided in terms of equivalent
increased transition area in the same wetland area on
the same site.
(4) Wetland Transition Areas are restricted from the following
activities:
(a) Removal, dumping, filling, excavation, or disturbance
of the soil, other than in association with any activities
identified in § 903.B.2.b.3 hereof.
(b) Erection of structures or paving, other than in
association with any activities identified in
§ 903.B.2.b.3 hereof.
(c) Destruction of plant life which would alter vegetation
patterns.
(d) Underground utilities, unless the property owner or
applicant can demonstrate that no feasible alternative
locations are available, and further provided that
hydrology stops exist to prevent a change in the
natural conveyance of natural ground water. Any
disturbed area shall be restored to its original state
following disturbance activity.
(5) Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to relieve a
property owner or applicant of the requirement to obtain a
Floodplain Permit under the provisions of the Floodplain
Ordinance of the respective municipality where the
property is located or a Conditional Use under § 903.B.13,
"Riparian Buffer Overlay Zone." [Amended effective 12/
9/2017 by JMZO Ord. No. 2015-02, adopted 12/4/

3. (Reserved)
4. Steep Slopes.
a. In areas of steep slopes, i.e., those above 15%, the following
standards shall apply:
(1) Fifteen percent to 25%: no more than 25% of such areas
shall be developed and/or regraded or stripped of
vegetation.
(2) Twenty-five percent or more: no more than 15% of such
areas shall be developed and/or regraded or stripped of
vegetation.
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:253
(3) Application for building permits shall include the following
information:
(a) Site plan of the property at a scale of one inch equals
50 feet indicating existing grades with contour lines at
two-foot intervals and proposed grades within the
area of the proposed construction;
(b) Landscaping plan indicating proposed paved areas,
storm drainage facilities, retaining walls, and ground
cover, as well;
(c) Architectural plans, elevations, and sections of the
structures and related improvements;
(d) A statement prepared by a qualified registered
architect or engineer stating an explanation of the
methods to be used in overcoming foundation and
other structural problems created by slope conditions,
in preserving the natural watersheds, and in
preventing soil erosion.
(e) A plan submitted under the seal of a registered
professional engineer showing and certifying the
following:
[1] All existing and proposed natural and artificial
drainage courses and other features for the
control of drainage, erosion, and water generally;
[2] The calculated volume of water run-off from the
slopes and from the lot in question, as
unimproved;
[3] The calculated volume of water run-off from the
slopes and from the lot in question, as improved;
[4] The existence, location, and capacity of all natural
and artificial drainage courses and facilities
within 500 feet of the lot, which are or will be
used to carry or contain the water run-off from the
slope and the lot; and
[5] The effect of any increased water runoff on all
adjacent properties and any other property which
will be materially affected by increased water runoff.
b. Exemptions. Areas of steep slope that are less than 3,000
square feet shall be exempted from these standards.
5. Woodland Associations. All wooded areas greater than 1/4 acre
shall be subject to the following restrictions:
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:254
a. Zoning districts of JM, CM, and CR-1: no more than 15% of
such areas shall be developed and/or regraded or cleared of
vegetation. The balance shall remain as open space.
b. All other Zoning Districts: no more than 50% of such areas
shall be developed and/or regraded or cleared of vegetation.
The minimum of remaining stands of trees shall not be less
than three times the height of the canopy. The remaining trees
shall be protected during construction from root compaction,
equipment and materials.
6. Trees on Wooded Lots.
a. Open Space Ratio equals 100% restrictions, unless otherwise
designated. No land within the tree protection zone shall be
altered, regraded, compacted, or built upon, or used for
storage or parking of vehicles.
b. The site layout plan shall indicate all existing trees which are
to be saved, the tree protection zone boundary, and the method
by which protection will occur. In addition, tree protection
techniques, in accordance with the local municipal Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance, shall be indicated on the
plan and its provisions shall be adhered to during construction.
c. No live tree of girth greater than 10 inches measured at a point
four feet above grade shall be removed in connection with a
land development or building permit unless a zoning permit for
a specific number of trees in a specific location is first obtained
from the municipal zoning officer upon recommendation by the
local planning commission. Permits will be granted only where
tree removal will not adversely affect the intent of this Section
or the utility and character of the overall foliage of the parcel
or lot in question. In no case will removal of trees exceed the
standards for steep slopes or woodland protection within
subsections 903.B.4 and 5. The permit provisions of this
Section shall not apply to a landowner who wishes to remove
an individual tree not in conjunction with a land development
or building permit.
d. For all healthy trees of a girth greater than 10 inches as
measured at a point four feet above grade, the following
standards shall apply. No greater than 1/3 of the roots may be
disturbed by the removal of topsoil or paving provided that a
similar amount of the canopy has been removed by a trained
arborist. Any filling within 35 feet of the trunk shall require a
tree well and/or aeration channels in accordance with the
standards of the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc.
7. Agricultural Soils. In the CM District, in areas of Agricultural Soils
as defined at § 205 of this Ordinance, the following standards shall
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:255
apply to the determination of required open space areas for all
residential uses:
No more than 25% of areas of Agricultural Soils shall be developed,
except as provided in Footnote 1 of § 902.B.2.b.
8. Aquifer Recharge Areas. (To be added by amendment)
9. Stormwater. All developments shall limit the rate of stormwater
runoff so that no greater rate of runoff is permitted than that of the
site in its pre-development condition. Where farm field or disturbed
earth is the pre-development condition, meadow shall be used as
the starting base for such calculations instead of the actual predevelopment
condition. All runoff calculations shall be based on
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. The method for such
calculations shall be that contained in the United States
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation "Engineering Field
Manual Notice  TR-55," as amended.
10. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation. All developments shall protect
streams, lakes, and ponds from sedimentation damage and shall
control erosion in accordance with the "Clean Streams Law" P.L.
1987, Chapter 102, except that in addition all developments shall
submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan as required by
the municipal subdivision and land development ordinance as part
of the preliminary land development plan even 25 acres in extent.
11. Grading and Erosion Control. During the preparation for
installation of and use of areas coming under this control, the
developer shall meet the requirements specified in § 903.B.10 of
this Ordinance.
a. No increased erosion will occur as a result of the planned
development of the lot;
b. No increased water run-off will occur which will materially and
adversely affect any property other than the lot to be
developed.
12. A Delaware Canal Overlay District is hereby created and adopted
which shall, except as noted herein, comprise all land areas within
60 feet of the property line of the Delaware Canal structure. The
property line of the Delaware Canal shall be determined from a
survey to be provided by an applicant or owner in accordance with
the regulations and guidelines of the DCNR and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A typical cross-section as
promulgated by the DCNR is attached hereto and adopted as a
representative sample of the methodology of establishing the lot
line.
a. Purpose. A Delaware Canal Overlay Zoning District is created
for the following purposes:30
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:256
(1) To preserve natural, scenic and historic values in the
environment, especially along the Federally-recognized
Delaware and Lehigh Navigation Canal National Heritage
Corridor and the Delaware Canal State Park; and
(2) To preserve woodlands, riparian buffers and to conserve
other areas of significant environmental sensitivity that
should not be intensely developed; and
(3) To protect the public health and safety of existing
residents against the harm from flooding; and
(4) To regulate uses and structures at, along or near natural
or artificial bodies of water, especially to avoid increased
erosion; and
(5) To regulate uses and structures at, places having unique
historical, architectural patriotic interest or value; and
(6) To regulate uses and structures at, along or near places of
relatively steep slope or grade, or other areas of hazardous
geological or topographic features, especially to avoid
increased erosion and sedimentation; and
(7) To encourage compatible land uses along the Delaware
Canal; and
(8) To encourage landowners, where the dimensions of the
property and proposed new structure(s) or
improvement(s) permit, to locate structures or
improvements as close to the front yard setback line (or, if
the property fronts on the canal, the rear yard setback
line) in order to maximize the special setback area and
minimize encroachments into the canal viewshed, all in
furtherance of the purposes of this overlay district.
b. Relationship to Other Zoning Districts. The Canal Overlay
District is an overlay to the existing zoning districts. The
provisions of the underlying district shall remain in full force,
except where the provisions of the overlay district differ from
the provisions of the underlying district, in which case the
provision which is more restrictive and less permissive to a
landowner or applicant shall apply.
c. Special Minimum Setbacks for New Structures. Sixty feet from
the lot line for the Delaware Canal State Park as established by
a survey to be performed by the owner or applicant in
conformance with the regulations and guidelines of the DCNR
and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A typical cross-section as
promulgated by the DCNR is attached hereto and adopted as a
30.Editor's Note: See Attachment 3 to this article.
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:257
representative sample of the methodology of establishing the
lot line.
(1) The overlay district setback requirement shall terminate at
the edge of River Road or Taylorsville Road, i.e., the
setback requirement shall not extend to land on the
opposite side of River Road or Taylorsville Road from the
canal.
(2) If a principal structure as proposed meets all other
requirements, including impervious surface, but cannot fit
within the building envelope created by the applicable
front, side and/or rear yard setback requirements and the
special setback created by this Section, then the setback of
the yard which is opposite the canal lot line reduced by no
more than 25% of the setback requirement of that yard.
(3) Structures subject to the special set-back created by this
Section shall include the principal structure on a lot and
those improvements which are considered structures
under Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance § 1000.E.3.b.(1),
namely, patios, porches, decks and similar structures, but
as applied to all lots regardless of size. Projections into
yards which are permitted under JMZO § 1000.E.3.a. shall
be permitted in the special setback created by this
Section. Accessory buildings which are permitted under
JMZO § 1000.E.4 shall be permitted in the special set-back
created by this Section so long as there are no more
stringent provisions prohibiting or placing other
limitations on said structures contained elsewhere in the
JMZO. In that event, the most stringent provisions shall
apply.
d. Buffer Yards.
(1) The first 30 feet of the special set-back created by this
Section, i.e., the 30 feet closest to the edge of the
Delaware Canal shall be a buffer yard composed of
planting of indigenous species of deciduous and/or
evergreen trees and shrubs whenever there is present or
proposed to be on any lot a new or expanded:
(a) Commercial or industrial use;
(b) Outdoor commercial or industrial storage area;
(c) Area routinely used for the parking, loading or
unloading of motor vehicles; or,
(d) Stormwater detention basin of more than 20,000
square feet in maximum detention area, unless the
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:258
basin is planted in grass and is suitable for being
mowed or will clearly resemble a natural pond.
The buffer yard provided for in this subsection d., shall
be part of and not in addition to, the special minimum
setback provided for in subsection c., of this Section.
(2) The requirement of § 1003 of the Joint Municipal Zoning
Ordinance regarding screening, landscaping and plant
materials shall apply to the buffer yards. The buffer yard
shall be free of above-ground structures (temporary and
permanent), dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage
or display, manufacturing or processing activity, material,
loading or unloading areas, or vehicular parking. No new
driveways or roadways shall be permitted in the buffer
yards except at points of ingress and egress. Septic
systems shall be permitted in the buffer yard provided the
entire system is an underground system (i.e., the entire
system is underground) and any portions of the system
which are, of necessity, located above ground are fully
screened from view from the canal with the appropriate
plantings. In no case shall sand mounds or spray irrigation
systems be permitted within the buffer yard.
(3) If a substantial natural berm or slope or dense vegetation
will be maintained and will be substantial enough to meet
the buffer provisions of this Section, or if topographic
conditions or the creations of berming by the developer
would clearly relieve the need and cause for screening the
Applicant may request appropriate relief from the Zoning
Hearing Board.
(4) Any fence that may be constructed shall be on the inside of
any required screening.
(5) Required plant materials shall have a minimum height
when planted of three feet. Plant materials used in the
planting screen shall be of such species, spacing and size
as can reasonably be expected to produce, within five
years, a solid year-round visual screen at least six feet in
height.
(6) When the use of the land in this district is subject to the
buffering requirements of the canal zoning overlay, the
following light encroachment controls shall be imposed to
control the spillage of light into the buffer and canal.
(a) Any primary structure, accessory structure, or other
device used to support any luminary that provides
illumination shall not allow the illumination to be
directed in the direction of the canal. Stray light shall
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:259
not be directed or focused onto the canal and the
buffer zone.
To accomplish these goals, the following restrictions
are imposed to control the spillage or focusing of light:
[1] No light fixtures shall be mounted on the wall of
any structure facing in the direction of the canal
that would allow the light emitted from that
fixture to illuminate the buffer zone of the canal.
[2] Light fixtures mounted on the wall of any
structure facing the canal shall be of the "full
shielded cut-off type" as defined by the IESNA.
There shall be no projecting refractors to allow
surface brightness.
[3] Light fixtures mounted on walls perpendicular to
the buffer zone shall have fully opaque sides and
not allow the transmission of any lateral light in
the direction of the buffer and the canal. There
shall be no projecting refractors to allow surface
brightness.
[4] Lighting fixtures mounted on poles located within
the setback shall not exceed 20 feet in height and
any fixture mounted on such pole shall be of the
"fully shielded cut-off type" as defined by the
IESNA and shall not exceed one-tenth foot
candles at the thirty-foot buffer yard portion of
the setback. There shall be no projecting
refractors to allow surface brightness.
e. Special Exceptions. Any structure, roadway, driveway or other
improvement which is proposed to be constructed in the
setback area or buffer yard provided for in this Section shall be
permitted only as special exception granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board.
f. Non-conforming Lots. Existing uses and structures shall be
considered non-conforming and nothing herein shall prevent
their continued existence or natural expansion, as permitted by
law, provided, however, that no such expansion shall encroach
further toward the canal than does any existing structure or
use.
13. Riparian Buffer Overlay Zone.
a. Creation and Purposes of Riparian Buffers. A Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zone (RBOZ) shall be and hereby is created in order to
protect and preserve the numerous benefits that are provided
by riparian buffers, including the following:
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:260
(1) Reduction of the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic
matter, pesticides, and other harmful substances that
reach watercourses through subsurface and surface flow
pathways through natural processes including filtration,
deposition, absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, and
denitrification, and by improving infiltration, sheet flow,
and stabilizing concentrated flows. The consumption of
nitrogen and denitrification in surface and groundwater
and the trapping of phosphorus-laden sediment and other
pollutants resulting from adjacent land uses, thereby
protecting water quality are critical;
(2) Provision of shade which moderates stream temperature
and protects fish habitats by retaining more dissolved
oxygen and encouraging the growth of diatoms, beneficial
algae and aquatic insects;
(3) Provision for stream bank stability that protects fish
habitats and controls sediment and erosion. Tree roots
consolidate the soils of floodplains and stream banks,
reducing the potential for severe bank erosion;
(4) Provision of organic matter through leaves which fall into
the stream and are trapped on woody debris (fallen trees
and limbs) and rocks where they provide food and habitats
for small bottom dwelling creatures (such as insects,
amphibians, crustaceans and small fish), which are critical
to the aquatic food chain; and
(5) Conservation of natural features important to land or
water resources (e.g. headwater areas, groundwater
recharge zones, floodways, floodplains, springs, streams,
woodlands, and prime wildlife habitats) that exist on
developed and undeveloped land.
b. Definitions. When used in this subsection 903.B.13 the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(1) The term "stream channel" shall mean the bed and banks
of a watercourse or Waters of the Commonwealth,
excluding roadside ditches, man-made drainage swales,
and drainage improvements constructed pursuant to
normal farming practices that confine and conduct
continuously or intermittently flowing water in or through
a participating Municipality.
(2) The term "land disturbance" shall mean any activity that
exposes soil, alters topography, alters the existing
structure of a woodland or hedgerow and/or removes
vegetation. Alteration includes the cutting or removal of
trees, understory shrubs and vines, woody and herbaceous
woodland floor species as well as the removal of humus or
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:261
duff from the ground. The term "land disturbance" shall
not include the mowing and routine maintenance of
existing lawn or any lawn area that may be permitted
within the RBOZ after the effective date of this Ordinance.
(3) The term "solar access window" shall mean the minimum
opening in the tree canopy needed to provide to the south
side of a structure that level of solar access which is
required for the effective operation of its solar energy
system. Any such solar access window shall be identified
and quantified on a solar energy plan prepared by a
professional, including an architect, with experience in the
design, construction or installation of active and/or passive
solar energy. Ground cover and the shrub or understory
layer may not be disturbed to create a solar access
window.
c. Relationship to Other Zoning Regulations. The RBOZ is an
overlay to the existing zoning districts within the participating
municipalities. The provisions of the underlying district shall
remain in full force, except where the provisions of the RBOZ
differ from the provisions of the underlying district, in which
case the provision which is more restrictive, and less
permissive, to a landowner or applicant shall apply.
d. Establishment. Measurement of the RBOZ shall be and is
hereby established as follows:
(1) Zone One. This zone will begin at each edge of a stream
channel and occupy a minimum width of 25 feet measured
horizontally on a line perpendicular to the top of the bank.
Where the land within 25 feet of the defined edge of a
stream channel has an upland slope greater than 10%,
Zone One shall include the land from the stream channel
edge and the upland slope and shall further extend
outward 25 feet from the edge or top of such upland slope;
(2) Zone Two. This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone
One and occupy a minimum width of 25 feet in addition to
Zone One, unless modified herein. Where the onehundred-
year floodplain extends greater than 50 feet from
the waterway, Zone One shall remain a minimum of 25
feet, and Zone Two shall extend from the outer edge of
Zone One to the outer edge of the one-hundred-year
floodplain.
e. Activities and Uses Permitted in the RBOZ.
(1) No structure, land disturbance or use shall be permitted

entering ground or surface waters as a part of the permit
application.
A. General Provisions.
1. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of
property and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the
disruption of commercial and governmental services, the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for
flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
a. Regulating uses, activities, and developments which, acting
alone or in combination with other existing or future uses,
activities, and developments, will cause increases in flood
heights, velocities, and frequencies;
b. Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and
developments from locating within areas subject to flooding;
c. Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do
occur in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or flood-proofed
against flooding and flood damage;
d. Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which
are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
2. Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the Participating Municipalities within this Part and
§ 904 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 905
I:273
shown as being located within the boundaries of the designated
floodplain district which is considered as part of the official Zoning
Map.
3. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this Part and any other applicable
ordinances and regulations which apply to structures and uses
within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.
4. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provisions of this Ordinance is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris, this Ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain District will be
free from flooding or flood damages, this Ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
5. Zoning Map. The boundaries of the Floodplain District are
established as part of the Zoning Map, which is declared to be a
part of this Ordinance and which shall be kept on file as each
municipal office.
6. Overlay Concept.
a. The Floodplain District described herein shall be an overlay to
the existing underlying districts as shown on the Zoning Map,
and the provisions for the Floodplain District shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions.
b. Where any conflict exists between the provisions or
requirements of the Floodplain District and those of any
underlying district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
c. A determination that any provision of the Floodplain District is
invalid by any legislative, administrative or judicial body shall
not affect the validity or applicability of the remaining
provisions of the Floodplain District.

C. Establishment of the Floodplain Zoning District.
1. Description of District.
§ 905 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 905
I:279
a. Basis of District. The Floodplain District shall include areas
subject to inundation by water of the one-hundred-year flood.
The basis for the delineation of this district shall be the most
recent formally adopted Flood Insurance Study prepared by
the Federal Insurance Administration under FIA contract.
The maps showing all areas considered to be subject to the
one-hundred-year flood are available for inspection at the
municipal offices. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the
following nomenclature is used in referring to the various
kinds of floodplain areas:
(1) The FW (Floodway Area) is delineated for purposes of this
Ordinance using the criteria that a certain area within the
floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the
one-hundred-year flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
point. The areas included in this area are specifically
defined in the Floodway Data Table contained in the abovereferenced
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and identified as
"Floodway" in the AE Zone as shown on the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Map. The term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in
the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) The FF (Flood-fringe Area) shall be that area of the onehundred-
year floodplain identified as Zone AE not included
in the Floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of
this District shall be the one-hundred-year flood elevations
contained in the flood profiles of the above-referenced
Flood Insurance Studies and as shown on the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(3) The FA (Approximated Floodplain) shall be that area of the
one-hundred-year floodplain for which no detailed flood
profiles or elevations are provided in the above-referenced
Flood Insurance Maps accompanying the study. When
available, information from other Federal, State and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the onehundred-
year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. In determining the one-hundred-year flood
elevations, the applicant for the proposed development
shall utilize approximate hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques as discussed in Subsection C.3
below.
b. Approximated Floodplain. In areas of any municipality where
no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been provided by
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), the Floodplain District shall
§ 905 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 905
I:280
include the approximate one-hundred-year flood boundary as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for each municipality
(hereinafter FA) and land areas which contain soil
characteristics indicative of flooding conditions, hereinafter
referred to as "floodplain soils." In these undesignated areas,
the floodplain soils shall be subject to the Floodplain District
Regulations contained herein. The floodplain soils shall include
any one or combination of the following soil classifications as
defined and classified in the 1975 Soil Survey of Bucks and
Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania (or as revised), prepared
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service:
Symbol Name
Ae Alluvial Land
AlA Alton Series
Bo Bowmansville Series
Ha Hatboro Series
Mh Marsh
PoA, PpA, PpB Pope Series
Ro Rowland Series
2. Floodplain District Boundary Changes Initiated By Participating
Municipalities. The Participating Municipalities in the Newtown
Area Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance may revise the Floodplain
District Boundary Map and these regulations where the
Participating Municipalities deem that such revisions are
appropriate. However, prior to adoption, any proposed revision
shall be submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration for its
review and approval.
3. Establishment and Interpretation of Floodplain District
Boundaries. Any property owner who is aggrieved by the
determination of the floodplain based upon the approximated
floodplain and floodplain soils, may submit to the Participating
Municipality in which the property is located, a Floodplain Study
for a one-hundred-year flood conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Type
15 Flood Insurance Study, for the Participating Municipality's
review. The Participating Municipality may, within its sole
discretion, adopt the property owner's Floodplain Study or reject it;
the Participating Municipality's decision in this regard being
considered final. The floodplain study shall conform to the
requirements of the "Procedure for Applicant Wishing to Challenge
Floodplain District Boundaries" which is attached to this Article as
Exhibit "A" and is incorporated herein by reference. Prior to acting
upon the challenge to the Floodplain District boundary, the
§ 905 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 905
I:281
Participating Municipality will submit the floodplain study to the
Federal Insurance Administration for its review.
The boundaries of the Floodplain District shall not be revised by a
reclassification of the soils on the site by a soil scientist, whether
or not the reclassification is approved by the Soil Conservation
Service.
A floodplain shall be established for every watercourse which
affects the property under study by the "Procedure for Applicant
wishing to Challenge Floodplain District Boundaries" whether or
not floodplain soils are present, as all watercourses have a
definable one-hundred-year floodplain.

and land development ordinance and as provided in the following:
1. Parking areas shall be permitted within required yards in OR Office
Research, LI Light Industrial, O-LI Office-Light Industrial Districts.
2. Front Yard Exceptions for Existing Alignment. If the alignment of
existing buildings on either side of a lot within a distance of 100
feet of the proposed building and fronting on the same side of the
same street in the same block is nearer to the street than the
required front yard depth, the governing body may accept the
average of such existing alignment within that distance as the
required front yard.
3. Projection into Yards.
a. An arbor, open trellis, flagpole, unroofed steps or sidewalks,
recreational structures, such as jungle gyms, swings and
sandboxes, and clothes drying apparatus shall be permitted as
a projection into the required side and rear yards provided

change.
A. General Requirements Applying to Required Off-Street Parking.
1. Structures and uses in existence at the date of adoption of this
Ordinance shall not be subject to the requirements of this Article so
long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any
parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced below such requirements.
2. Whenever there is an alteration of a use which increases the
parking requirements according to this Article, the total additional
parking required for the alteration, change, or extension shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements of this Article.
3. No parking area shall be used for any use that interferes with its
availability for the parking need it is required to serve.
4. All required facilities shall be provided and maintained as long as
the use exists which the facilities were designed to serve. The total
extent of off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced after their
provision, except upon the approval of the Local Zoning Hearing
Board and then only after proof that, by reason of diminution in
§ 1000 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1001
I:293
floor area, seating area, or the number of employees, or change in
other factors controlling the regulation of the number of parking
spaces, such reduction is in conformity with the requirements of
this Article. Reasonable precautions shall be taken by the owner
or sponsor of particular uses to assure the availability of required
facilities to the employees or other persons whom the facilities are
designed to serve. Such facilities shall be designed and used in
such a manner that at no time constitutes a nuisance, hazard, or
unreasonable impediment to traffic.
5. For parking areas of three or more vehicles, the area not
landscaped and so maintained, including driveways, shall be
graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable material, and
drained to the satisfaction of the municipal engineer to the extent
necessary to prevent dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across
streets or adjoining property. All off-street parking spaces shall be
marked so as to indicate their location. Failure to keep parking
areas in satisfactory condition (i.e., free from holes, clearly
delineated, or properly graded) shall be considered a violation of
this Ordinance.
6. All off-street parking lots and areas for the display, storage, sale, or
movement of three or more motor vehicles shall be adequately
buffered from adjacent streets and properties and landscaped in
accordance with an overall plan as required in subsection 1001.F.6.
7. Within the VR-1, VR-4, VC-1, VC-2, TC and TC-2 Districts, a
structurally sound wall or fence, or other abutment to insure safety
shall be installed around each side of the parking lot wherever said
lot adjoins a public street, sidewalk, or alley; and an adequate
retaining wall, wherever necessary, to prevent the washing of soil
to and from adjoining property, shall also be provided.
8. Within the VC-1, VC-2, TC, and TC-2 Districts, any use existing as of
the effective day of this Ordinance which can be lawfully expanded,
or any new use that cannot meet the parking requirements of this
Ordinance within the lot lines of the principal use may meet the
parking requirements of this zoning ordinance by either:
a. On an annual basis the landowner shall show proof of a lease of
the required parking spaces within 300 feet of the premises
and in the same district; or
b. The landowner shall pay the Participating Municipality in
which the use takes place a fee-in-lieu for each required
parking space, to be determined by a formula set forth by
resolution by the Participating Municipality for the acquisition,
construction, and maintenance of public parking.

within five feet of the side and/or rear property lines in the TC Town
Commercial District, and within 10 feet of the side and/or rear
property lines in all other districts, except as provided in
§ 1000.E.1. However, driveways, parking aisles, and parking spaces
may be permitted in side or rear yards in the TC Town Commercial
District when these parking improvements are shared between two
or more abutting uses.
5. Computation.
a. When determination of off-street parking spaces required by
this Ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of 1/2 or less may be disregarded while a fraction
in excess of 1/2 shall be counted as one parking space.
b. Off-street parking space shall be required as provided for each
use in Article VIII. All uses which do not have a parking
requirement in Article VIII and which have a lot coverage in
excess of 10% shall provide at least one off-street parking
space for each 220 square feet of gross floor area.
§ 1001 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1001
I:297
c. For industrial uses, if less than one parking space is provided
for each 470 square feet of floor area, sufficient space shall be
preserved within the building setback lines for future
expansion of parking facilities to that number without

6. Buffer and Landscape Requirements Parking lots for all uses for
which buffering is specified in Article XIII, and all off-lot parking
areas shall be subject to the following requirements:
a. Except within the TC Town Commercial District, no off-street
parking spaces shall be located less than 20 feet from any
public street right-of-way line and 10 feet from any property
line.
b. Any area for off-street parking or for storage or movement of
three or more motor vehicles shall be buffered, except at
entrances or exits, from streets and from residential or other
uses with less intensive parking requirements. The buffer shall
consist of an ornamental fence or wall consistent with the
architectural character of the surrounding uses, or by a
compact evergreen hedge, not less than four feet in height.
Where a planted screen is proposed, it shall incorporate the
planting of staggered and overlapping evergreen and
deciduous shrubs of such species and size as will produce
within two growing seasons (May through September) after
planting a screen at least four feet higher than the elevation of
the adjacent parking area and of such density as will obscure
75% of the light emitted from automobile headlights on the
premises throughout the full course of the year. Where the
adjacent land elevation is higher than the parking area
elevation, trees and shrubs shall be at least two feet in height,
satisfaction of the four foot requirement notwithstanding.
These provisions shall not, however, interfere with the
maintenance of clear sight lines at intersections. Where such
screening is required, it shall be assured by a performance
guarantee posted with the governing body in an amount equal
to 20% of the estimated cost of the plantings. Such guarantee
shall be released only after passage of the second growing
season following planting.

20-vehicle width shall be separated from one another by
planting strips not less than 10 feet in width.
d. Except in the TC Town Commercial District, no less than 10%
of a proposed parking area must consist of buffer areas and
islands and must be landscaped and continually maintained.
Planting along the perimeter of a parking area, whether for
required screening or general beautification, will be
considered as part of the required parking area landscaping.
G. Reduction of Nonresidential Parking Requirements. In order to prevent
the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than is
actually required to serve the needs of nonresidential uses, the
governing body, after consulting with the planning commission and the
municipal engineer, may permit a conditional reduction of parking
space if the following conditions are satisfied:
1. The conditional reduction of parking spaces may apply to the
following:
a. The minimum number of parking spaces required for a land
use is in excess of actual parking needs.
b. The operating schedules of two or more land uses are such that
a parking lot may be shared between them and that the
minimum number of parking spaces required for each land use
is in excess of actual parking needs.
2. The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land development
plan, must designate sufficient space to meet the parking
requirement. The plan shall also illustrate the layout for the total
number of parking spaces, which must be in compliance with the
impervious surface and yard requirements of this Ordinance.
3. The balance of the parking area conditionally reserved shall not
include areas for required buffer yards, setbacks, or areas which
would otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the
physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of this
Ordinance. This parking area which is reserved shall be located
and have characteristics so as to provide amenable open space
should it be determined the additional parking spaces are not
required. The developer shall provide with the land development
plan a landscaping plan for the reserved area.
4. If required by the governing body, the developer or owner shall
post a performance bond or other securities to cover the expense of
a traffic study to be undertaken by a registered traffic engineer of
the governing body's choosing who shall determine the advisability

A. General Provisions.
1. It is mandatory that the recorded plan and the deeds indicate that
there shall be no additional development of the open space. The
open space shall be restricted against any future building,
development, or use except as is consistent with that of providing
for open space for recreation, conservation, agricultural uses, and
§ 1003 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1005
I:305
access ways and parking facilities accessory thereto. Buildings
or uses for noncommercial recreation, cultural, or agricultural
purposes compatible with the open space objective may be
permitted only with the express approval of the governing body,
following approval of the building, site and operational plans by
the governing body. The governing body may, at its sole discretion,
make post-development changes within development open space
to improve stormwater management, increase stormwater
infiltration, implement stormwater best management practices, or
make other changes to reduce flooding, reduce water pollution,
or comply with local, county, state and federal stormwater
management requirements.
2. All documents pertaining to the conveyance and maintenance of
the open space shall meet the approval of the municipal solicitor as
to legal form and effect with recommendations from the local
planning commission and the local park and recreation boards as to
suitability for the proposed use of the open space and be approved
by the governing body as part of the final plan approval.
3. Layout of open space within the Conservation Management
District. A primary purpose of the open space within this district is
to preserve agriculture lands for agricultural use. Therefore, the
plan for open space areas shall clearly demonstrate that every
effort has been made to provide a maximum amount of farmland
preserved for agriculture. Pursuant to a participating
municipality's Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, a
participating governing body, upon the recommendation of the
local planning commission, may permit greater encroachment into
areas of forests, slopes, or shorelines in order to maximize the
protection of Class I, II or III agricultural soils. A plan which does
not provide for the agricultural use of the majority of Class I, II or
III soils shall not be deemed to meet the provisions of this
Ordinance. A planted buffer may be required between the
residential areas and the open space retained for agricultural
purposes where appropriate. Where, on any adjacent property,
permanently protected open space or land in active agricultural
use is located within 50 feet of a property proposed for
development with open space requirements, the open space within
the proposed development shall be located at one or more
locations, as approved by the governing body, near the common
property line with the adjacent agricultural land or open space in
order to establish a contiguous area of open space. See § 902.B.2,
Calculation for Land with Resource Restrictions and Resource
Protection, for the calculation of protected agricultural soils.
The governing body may require a planted buffer between existing
and/or proposed residential uses or other existing uses and the
open space retained for agricultural purposes. The proposed
agricultural uses of the open space, the location of existing and
§ 1005 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 1005
I:306
proposed ownership of the agricultural open space, and the
methods to restrict the use of open space to agricultural uses
are permitted only with the expressed approval of the governing
body. The governing body may attach conditions and safeguards
in addition to those expressed in this Ordinance, or may deny
agricultural use of open space where agricultural use of open space
may result in impacts on or be incompatible with other uses of
land in the Conservation Management District or other adjoining
districts.
4. Where open space is designated on a subdivision plan or is
restricted from further subdivision and/or development by a
restriction in a deed and/or by a note on a subdivision plan, the
open space shall not be further subdivided, regardless of an
intervening zoning change.
5. In all zoning districts, the open space designated within a
development area shall not be merely leftover or unusable land. It
shall be laid out to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors
according to sound site design principles. Except in the
Conservation Management District, open space shall be accessible
to a maximum number of the residents of a developed area, and
shall be provided in accordance with the participating
municipality's subdivision and land development ordinance. In the
Conservation Management District, the requirements of § 1005.A.3
shall be met. Further, the open space designated within a
development area shall be arranged so as to encompass a single
land area or minimum number of areas, linked by a common means
of circulation and access; and, it shall be contiguous to the
developed area and not separated from it by existing roads unless
safe pedestrian access can be provided. Open space areas may only
be bisected by roads when approved by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Open Space Design Standards. [Amended effective 9/23/2018 by
JMZO Ord. No. 2017-04, adopted 9/18/2018.]
1. Areas set aside for open space shall be suitable for the designated
purpose and in any event shall be consistent with the plan policy for
future land use in the municipality. Any such area shall contain no
structure other than a structure related to the purposes of open
spaces. Where structures relating to open space or recreational
activity are located in the Developed Open Space, no more than 5%
of that area, or 10,000 square feet, whichever is greater, may be
converted to building areas. Structures relating to agricultural
uses shall conform with the provisions of Use A-1.1, 2, 3, and 4, in
§ 803.
2. Any land set aside as open space of such a size as may be capable of
future subdivision under the regulations of this Ordinance must be
made subject to a deed restriction or agreement in a form

open space.
c. The dedication of open space, streets, or other lands in
common ownership of the corporation, association, individual,
or other legal entity or the municipality shall be absolute and
not subject to reversion for possible future use for further
development.

Article XI
SIGNS
§ 1100. Objectives. [Readopted effective 6/23/2007 by JMZO Ord.
2007, adopted 6/18/2007.]
The objectives of this Article are to establish requirements for placing,
installing and maintaining signs, in order to preserve and protect the health,
safety, welfare and general well-being of the community's citizens. Just as
regulations for the placement, construction and maintenance of buildings
and structures through zoning is a valid use of the law so are regulations
for the placement, installation and maintenance of signs a valid use of the
law, because signs, in the literal sense, must be considered structures, and,
in a practical sense, are capable of producing many of the same nuisances
as buildings produce.
Sign regulations are further justified by the primary purpose of a sign: to
draw attention to its content. However, since signs can distract drivers or
obstruct views, the very nature of a sign can be a potential hazard to the
safety of the motoring public. Therefore, it is the intent of this Ordinance to
regulate the location of signs in such a way that they can fulfill their purpose
without causing unsafe conditions for motorists.
Finally, it is the objective of this Article to protect and preserve the visual
character of the community by regulating the placement, installation and
maintenance of signs. Because signs are intended to command visual
contact this gives them an important role in the overall visual character
of a community. This visual impact is an economic fact that affects the
value of property, as well as its enjoyment. Therefore, the regulation of
signs can work to conserve the value of property and encourage the most
appropriate use of land throughout a municipality. Good planning requires a
Such plan shall be in accordance with all other applicable sections
of this Ordinance.
3. No alteration of any stream, pond, or lake shall be permitted unless
in accordance with a plan approved by a majority vote of the
association of property owners, if applicable, pursuant to review
and approval by the municipal governing body. Such plan shall be
in accordance with other applicable sections of this Ordinance and
all applicable regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
4. No structures shall be erected unless in accordance with a plan
approved by a majority vote of the association of property owners,
if applicable, pursuant to review and approval by the municipal
governing body. Such plan should be in accordance with all other
applicable sections of this Ordinance.

applicable to a use or establishment that has a facade and/or an
entrance on more than one street, common parking area, or pedestrian
way. Such use or establishment shall be limited to one sign which shall
face onto the primary or largest adjoining parking lot/area within the
development.
C. A sign permit is required under the provisions of this Ordinance.
A. The zoning districts established by this Ordinance are designed to
guide future use of land in the region by encouraging the development
of desirable residential, commercial, and manufacturing areas with
appropriate grouping or compatible and related uses, to the end of
promoting and protecting the public health, safety, comfort, prosperity,
and other aspects of the general welfare.
B. To achieve this end, lawfully existing uses, structures, lots, and signs
which would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendments and which do not conform to the
character and regulations of the zoning district in which they are
located must be subject to certain limitations. The regulations set forth
below are intended to provide a gradual remedy for the undesirable
conditions resulting from indiscriminate mixing of uses, structures,
lots, and signs and to afford a means whereby such nonconformities can
be gradually eliminated and re-established in more suitable locations
within the Joint Municipal Region.

A. When a nonconforming building or structure is destroyed or partially
destroyed by fire, explosion, or other disaster, or is otherwise damaged
to the extent of 50% of the appraised replacement value of such
building or structure, such nonconforming building or structure shall
not be restored, or rebuilt, except in such manner as to conform to the
regulations of this Ordinance, and amendments thereto. When a
nonconforming building or structure is partially destroyed by fire,
explosion, or other disaster to less than 50% of its appraised
replacement value, it may be restored to its original use in accordance
with provisions of this Ordinance but must be restored within one year
of such happening.
B. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or
restoration to a safe condition of any walls, floor, foundation, or roof
which has been declared unsafe by the municipal building inspector.
A. In granting a conditional use, the governing body or its authorized
representatives shall make findings of fact consistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance. The governing body or its authorized
representatives shall not approve a conditional use except in
conformance with the conditions and standards outlined in this
Ordinance.
B. The governing body or its authorized representatives shall grant a
conditional use only if it finds adequate evidence that any proposed
development submitted will meet all of the following general
requirements as well as any specific requirements and standards listed
herein for the proposed use. The governing body or its authorized
representatives shall require that any proposed use and location among
other things be:
1. In accordance with the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan for
Newtown Township, Upper Makefield Township, and Wrightstown
§ 1209 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 1301

the immediate vicinity and which shall be in the best interests of
the municipality, the benefit of the community, and the public
welfare;

file those applications simultaneously or to file the application for
conditional use first and process it to conclusion without the necessity
to file more intricate land development plans. Should the applicant file
the applications simultaneously, and request simultaneous review, the
applicant assumes the risk of cost of preparation of plans for both
applications and the cost of modifications the municipality may require
in the review process. Approval of both conditional use and subdivision
and land development shall be required before the issuance of any
zoning permit.
A. The landowner shall make a written request to the governing body or its
authorized representatives of the municipality in which the parcel of
land is located. The request shall contain a statement reasonably

the governing body or its authorized representatives shall at the time of
making application pay to the zoning officer, for the use of the
municipality, a fee in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by

the extent to which the new or expanded use is susceptible of
regulation or restriction by appropriate conditions and
safeguards.

or change, and determine that the proposal will serve the best
interests of the municipality, the convenience of the
community, and the public health, safety, morals, and general

with respect to congestion on the roads or highways, the most
appropriate use of land, conserving the value of buildings,
safety from fire, panic and other dangers, adequacy of light
and air, the prevention of overcrowding the land, congestion of
population, and the adequacy of public and community
services.
e. Make certain that the proposed change is reasonable in terms
of the logical, efficient, and economical extension of public
services and facilities, such as public water, sewers, police and
fire protection, transportation, and public schools.
f. Take into consideration the character and type of development
in the area surrounding the location for which the request is
made and determine that the proposed change or modification,
as permitted, will constitute an appropriate use in the area and
will not substantially injure or detract from the use of
surrounding property or from the character of the
neighborhood.
4. The burden will be upon the applicant to show:
a. The ability and capacity of the existing public water system to
provide the needs of the proposed use without system

the wastes from the proposed use without system extensions
beyond those which the applicant will provide;

for the needs of the proposed use without substantially altering
existing traffic patterns or overloading the existing street
system and the availability of other public facilities such as
parks and playgrounds to meet the additional demands for

2007 by JMZO Ord. 2007, adopted 6/18/2007.]
A. Procedure upon Municipal Curative Amendment.
1. A participating municipality, by formal action, may declare the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof substantially
invalid and propose that the participating municipalities prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. The formal action
shall make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity of
the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance which may include:
a. References to specific uses which are either not permitted, or
not permitted in sufficient quantity,
b. References to a class of use or uses which require revision, or
c. Reference to the entire Ordinance which requires revisions.
2. The governing bodies of the remaining municipalities shall vote,
within 30 days following such declaration by the initiating
governing body, by formal action whether or not to declare the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof substantially
invalid. In the event of the failure of a majority of the participating
municipalities to declare the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance or
portions thereof substantially invalid within the 30 days following
such declaration, the declaration by the first participating
municipality shall be deemed null and void.
3. The declaration by a majority of the participating municipalities of
the substantive invalidity of the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance
shall be binding upon all the participating municipalities from the
moment the initiating governing body declares the Joint Municipal
Zoning Ordinance invalid, provided that the majority of all
§ 1512 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1601
I:383
participating municipalities approves of the formal action within 30
days. In the event that a majority of the participating municipalities
vote, by formal action, not to declare the Joint Municipal Zoning
Ordinance invalid in accordance with this Section, subsection
1601.D shall not apply.
4. Upon the declaration that the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance is
invalid by the majority of the participating municipalities, the
participating municipalities shall begin to prepare and consider a
curative amendment to the Joint municipal zoning ordinance to
correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration by the first
participating municipality, pursuant to subsection 1601.A.1 above, the
municipalities shall enact a curative amendment to or reaffirm the
validity of this Ordinance pursuant to the provisions required by § 1602,
to cure the declared invalidity of this Ordinance.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures by the first governing body as set
forth in Section 1601.A, any participating governing body shall not be
required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment
as provided for within the PA Municipalities Planning Code, nor shall
the Local Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested
under §§ 1507.A and B subsequent to the declaration and proposal
based upon the grounds identical to or substantially similar to those
specified in the resolution required by subsection 1601.A.1. Upon
completion of the procedures as set forth in §§ 1601.A and B, no rights
to a cure pursuant to the provisions of the PA Municipalities Planning
Code, shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any
landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of this Ordinance
for which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
Section.
D. The municipalities having jointly utilized the procedures as set forth in
