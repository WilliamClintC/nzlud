provided under this plan attributable to contributions of the employer shall
exceed, as an annual amount, the amount specified in Code Section
415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d), assuming the
form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits).
The limitations described in this § 47-24 shall be governed by the following
conditions and definitions:
A. Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to the
plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to determine
the limitation contained herein;
B. In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of age
62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant to this

D. Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
section, provided that the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated;
however, in the case of a participant who is not receiving a survivor
benefit pursuant to § 47-33 or 47-33.1 or a disability retirement benefit
pursuant to § 47-29 with fewer than 10 years of participation, the
limitation expressed in this Subsection D shall be reduced by 1/10 for
each year of participation less than 10, but in no event shall this
limitation be less than $1,000;
E. The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all
defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined
contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted consistent with
Code Section 415 and regulations thereunder as applicable to
government plans in general and this plan in particular; and
F. In the case of a survivor benefit under § 47-33 or 47-33.1 or a disability

hereof shall not apply, and the applicable limitation shall be the
limitation contained herein without regard to the age of the benefit

extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the
joint life expectancies of such participant and a designated
beneficiary).
B. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior to
the date when his entire interest has been distributed to him after
distribution of his benefits has begun in accordance with Subsection
A(2) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at
least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under
Subsection A(2) as of the date of his death.

payable only to the participant or designated beneficiary and shall not be
subject to assignment or transfer unless the subject of a domestic relations
order, mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction, that clearly provides
for proper distribution of a portion of the pension benefit payments to an
alternate payee (former spouse of the participant) and does not require any
benefit to be paid in excess of the available funds earned and accrued under
the plan.

the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such
designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life
expectancy of such beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later
than one year after the date of the employee's death or such later date
as provided by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; then
for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence,
the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed
on the date on which such distributions begin; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated beneficiary
is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date on which
distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the date
upon which the employee would have attained age 70 1/2; and, further
provided that, if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to
such spouse begin, this subsection shall be applied as if the surviving
spouse were the employee.
D. For purposes of this section, the following definitions and procedures
shall apply:
(1) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of the calendar year in which the employee
attains age 70 1/2 or the calendar year in which the employee
retires.
(2) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its rules.
(3) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid to
the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the
surviving spouse upon such child's reaching majority (or other
designated event permitted under regulations issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury).
(4) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than
annually.

However, such portion may only be paid to an individual retirement
account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code,
or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section

the disability date.
§ 47-29. Benefit.
A participant who shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit under
§ 47-28 shall receive a benefit in the amount as calculated pursuant to
§ 47-16, reduced by the amount of any payments for which the participant
shall be eligible under any workers' compensation or similar laws or any
other disability compensation program provided by the employer, including
social security disability benefits.
§ 47-30. Payment of disability benefits.
§ 47-31. Verification of disability.
The plan administrator shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a
participant shall have incurred a total and permanent disability. The plan
administrator shall rely on the determination of eligibility to receive a
federal social security disability benefit and the facts and circumstances
causing such disability. If the plan administrator shall determine that a
participant is no longer eligible for receipt of a disability retirement benefit
under this plan, the payment of such benefits shall cease.
A. Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of each
month, commencing as of the first day of the month immediately
following or coincident with the participant's disability date and
continuing until the earliest of the death of the participant or cessation
of total and permanent disability.
B. A participant who shall fail to return within three months to
employment as an employee of the employer upon cessation of total and
permanent disability prior to the normal retirement date shall be
deemed to have terminated employment as of the disability date and
shall not be entitled to any refund of accumulated contributions
pursuant to § 47-35, unless the accumulated contributions exceeds the
total amount of disability benefits paid under the plan, then the
participant shall be entitled to receive a refund in an amount equal to
the accumulated contributions as of the disability date minus the total
amount of disability benefits paid under the plan. In lieu of receiving a
refund of accumulated contributions, such a participant may elect to
receive vested benefits pursuant to § 47-36, which shall be reduced by

cause a cessation of entitlement to receipt of such benefits hereunder. If
a participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator
of any such change in status and continues to receive payment of benefits
hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, then the plan may take
whatever action is necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid
amounts, including legal action or offsetting such amounts against any
future payments of retirement or other benefits under the plan, including
the costs of such actions.

participant in an amount equal to 50% of the participant's accrued benefit
as of the date of death. The survivor benefit shall be paid monthly to the
surviving spouse, commencing on or after the date that would have been
the participant's earliest retirement date if the participant had survived to
such date, reduced based upon the plan's early retirement factors pursuant
to § 47-19. Payment of this survivor benefit under this § 47-33 precludes
any distribution of the participant's accumulated contributions pursuant to
§ 47-35.
§ 47-33.1. Death of participant after retirement.
In the event that a participant shall die after the receipt of any benefit
payments under the plan, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the amount of
the accumulated contributions of the participant minus the total amount of
benefits paid under the plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, where a joint and survivor form of benefit has been selected,
payments upon the occurrence of the death of the participant shall first
be made in accord with the form of benefit payment so selected, and
the provisions of this § 47-33.1 shall be applicable upon the death of the
survivor. Where the total amount of benefits paid under the plan exceeds
the amount of the participant's accumulated contributions, there shall be no
additional amounts due under the plan.

participant and beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments
from the plan.

Ord. No. 191243]

who shall have completed 10 years of aggregate service with the
employer and who ceases to be an employee of the employer for any
reason other than death, retirement or total and permanent disability
may elect to vest retirement benefits under the plan by filing a written
notice of the intention to vest with the plan administrator within 90
days of the date employment ceases. A participant who exercises such
an option shall be eligible, upon attainment of what would have been
normal retirement date, for a vested retirement benefit equal to the
accrued benefit, determined as of the date on which employment
ceased. If a participant elects to vest a benefit but dies prior to the
commencement thereof, the beneficiary shall be entitled to a refund of
the participant's accumulated contributions in accordance with the
terms of §§ 47-32 and 47-35.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant hired before January 1,
2005, who has completed eight years of aggregate service and who
ceases to be an employee of the employer after October 1, 2012, may
elect to vest retirement benefits under the plan in the same manner as
described in the preceding paragraph and, if so elected, would be
considered a deferred vested participant as defined in Article II

under the procedure hereinafter set forth:
A. Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the Committee which
shall fully describe the nature of the claim. The Committee shall review
the claim and make an initial determination approving or denying the
claim.
B. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Committee shall, within 90
days (or such other period as may be established by applicable law)

days by the Committee's delivering notice of such extension to the
claimant within the first ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall

Board within 60 days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such
review, the claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the
right to review any pertinent documents and to submit any issues or
comments in writing. The Board shall, within 60 days after receipt of
the notice requesting such review, (or in special circumstances, such as
where the Board in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days
of receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person or
persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be final,
conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific
references to the pertinent plan provisions on which the decision is
based.
D. Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay status
shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first payment
which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the Committee
allows a later filing for good cause shown.

The limitations described in this § 47-86 shall be governed by the following
conditions and definitions:
A. Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to the
plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to determine
the limitation contained herein;
B. In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of age
62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant to this
section commencing at age 62; however, in the case of a qualified
participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least 15
years of service, including applicable military service, as a full-time
employee of a police or fire department is taken into account in
determining the amount of benefit), the limitation contained herein

C. In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age 65 by
the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis in accordance with applicable regulations to the
amount determined commencing at age 65;
D. Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
section, provided that the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated;
however, in the case of a participant who is not receiving a survivor
benefit pursuant to § 47-96.1 or a disability retirement benefit pursuant
to § 47-91, with fewer than 10 years of participation, the limitation

calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans

defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined
contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted consistent with
Code Section 415 and regulations thereunder as applicable to
government plans in general and this plan in particular; and
F. In the case of a survivor benefit under § 47-96.1 or a disability
retirement benefit under § 47-91, the adjustment under Subsection B
hereof shall not apply, and the applicable limitation shall be the
limitation contained herein without regard to the age of the benefit
recipient.

any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to his death shall
be distributed either:

and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of
such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the
joint life expectancies of such participant and a designated
beneficiary).
B. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior to
the date when his entire interest has been distributed to him after
distribution of his benefits has begun in accordance with Subsection
A(2) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at
least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under
Subsection A(2) as of the date of his death.
C. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies before
distribution of his benefit has begun, the entire interest of such
employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of
the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such
designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life
expectancy of such beneficiary) and such distributions begin not later
than one year after the date of the employee's death or such later date
as provided by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury,
then, for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in the preceding
sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as
distributed on the date on which such distributions begin; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then
the date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be
earlier than the date upon which the employee would have attained age

order, mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction, that clearly provides
for proper distribution of a portion of the pension benefit payments to an
alternate payee (former spouse of the participant) and does not require any
benefit to be paid in excess of the available funds earned and accrued under
the plan.
§ 47-89. Retired participants.
Any participant who shall have retired prior to the restatement date shall
not have the benefit altered in any way by the provisions of this amended

permanent disability shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit as of
the disability date.
§ 47-91. Benefit. [Amended 3-14-2000 by Ord. No. 1775]
A participant who shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit under
§ 47-90 shall receive a benefit in the amount as calculated pursuant to
§ 47-80.
§ 47-92. Payment of benefits.
§ 47-93. Verification of disability.
The plan administrator shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a
participant shall have incurred a total and permanent disability. The plan
administrator shall rely on the determination of eligibility to receive a
federal social security disability benefit and the facts and circumstances
causing such disability. If the plan administrator shall determine that a
participant is no longer eligible for receipt of a disability retirement benefit
under this plan, the payment of such benefits shall cease.
A. Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of each
month, commencing as of the participant's disability date and
continuing until the earliest of the death of the participant or cessation
of total and permanent disability. The initial benefit payment shall be in
a prorated amount based upon the number of days from the actual
retirement date to the first day of the month following the date of
retirement.
B. Participant who shall fail to return within three months to employment
as an employee of the employer upon cessation of total and permanent
disability prior to normal retirement date shall be deemed to have
terminated employment as of the disability date and shall not be
entitled to any refund of accumulated contributions pursuant to
§ 47-95, unless the accumulated contributions exceed the total amount
of disability benefits paid under the plan, then the participant shall be
entitled to receive a refund in an amount equal to the accumulated
contributions as of the disability date minus the total amount of
disability benefits paid under the plan. In lieu of receiving a refund of
accumulated contributions, such a participant may elect to receive
vested benefits pursuant to § 47-99, which shall be reduced by any
payments made under this article.

§ 47-94. Cessation of disability.
A participant who is receiving payment of disability retirement benefits
under this plan must notify the plan administrator of any change which may
cause a cessation of entitlement to receipt of such benefits hereunder. If
a participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator
of any such change in status and continues to receive payment of benefits
hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, then the plan may take
whatever action is necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid
amounts, including legal action or offsetting such amounts against any
future payments of retirement or other benefits under the plan, including
the costs of such actions.

If a participant shall die prior to the commencement of the payment of any
retirement or other benefits under this plan and with eligibility for payment
of a survivor benefit under § 47-96.1, the beneficiary may elect to receive
a distribution of the participant's accumulated contributions determined
as of the date of death of the participant pursuant to § 47-69 in lieu of
the payment of the survivor benefit under § 47-96.1. If the participant
has received disability retirement benefits hereunder, the amount of
distribution of accumulated contributions shall be reduced by the amount of
disability retirement benefits which have been paid hereunder.
§ 47-96. Death of participant after retirement.
In the event that a participant shall die after the receipt of any benefit
payments under the plan, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the amount of
the accumulated contributions of the participant minus the total amount of
benefits paid under the plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, where a joint and survivor form of benefit has been selected,
payments upon the occurrence of the death of the participant shall first
be made in accord with the form of benefit payment so selected, and the
provisions of this § 47-96 shall be applicable upon the death of the survivor.
Where the total amount of benefits paid under the plan exceeds the amount
of the participant's accumulated contributions, there shall be no additional
amounts due under the plan.
§ 47-96.1. Survivor benefit. [Added 7-12-2005 by Ord. No. 1834;
amended 12-13-2005 by Ord. No. 1839]
A survivor benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse, if any, of the
participant in an amount equal to 50% of the participant's accrued benefit
as of the date of death. The survivor benefit shall be paid to the surviving
spouse, commencing on or after the date that would have been the
participant's earliest retirement date if the participant had survived to such
date, reduced based upon the plan's early retirement factors pursuant to
§ 47-83. Payment of this survivor benefit under this § 47-96.1 precludes
any distribution of the participant's accumulated contributions pursuant to
§ 47-95.

early retirement date shall be entitled to receive a refund of accumulated
contributions. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said
participant and beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments
from the plan.
§ 47-99. Vested benefits upon termination.
In lieu of receiving a refund of accumulated contributions, a participant
who shall have completed 10 years of aggregate service with the employer
and who ceases to be an employee of the employer for any reason other
than death, retirement or total and permanent disability may elect to vest
retirement benefits under the plan by filing a written notice of the intention
to vest with the plan administrator within 90 days of the date employment
ceases. A participant who exercises such an option shall be eligible, upon
attainment of what would have been normal retirement date, for a vested
retirement benefit equal to the accrued benefit, determined as of the date
on which employment ceased. If a participant elects to vest a benefit but

a refund of the participant's accumulated contributions in accordance with
the terms of §§ 47-92 and 47-95.

or resignation of the trustee and such additional dates as requested by the
employer, showing the condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements
and other transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by
the accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
§ 47-113. Value.
All determinations as to the value of the assets of the Pension Fund and as
to the amount of the liabilities thereof shall be made by the employer or its
appointed trustee, whose decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding
on all parties hereto, the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In
making any such determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to
seek and rely upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers,
appraisers and other experts and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports
as to sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as

clearly required by the context:
ACCRUED BENEFIT  As of any given date, the benefit determined under
§ 47-134B, calculated on the basis of final monthly average salary as of the
date of determination and multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the participant's aggregate service determined as of such date and
the denominator of which shall be the projected aggregate service of the
participant as if the participant continues in employment until attainment
of normal retirement age. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, in no event shall the fraction exceed 1.0. The accrued benefit
shall not exceed the maximum limitation, determined as of the date of
computation, provided under § 47-134G. All accrued benefits are subject
to all applicable limitations, reductions, offsets and actuarial adjustments
provided pursuant to the terms of the plan prior to the actual payment
thereof.

participant to this pension fund or its predecessor by way of payroll
deduction or otherwise, plus interest credited at 4% per annum. Interest
shall be credited in the form of a compound interest rate from the first
day of the plan year following the date on which the contributions were
paid to the first day of the month preceding the date that a distribution
of accumulated contributions under § 47-136B or 47-137B shall be paid or
payment of benefits shall commence. Interest shall be credited as described

receive a distribution of accumulated contributions with respect to a period
of employment for which employee contributions are required, such period
of employment shall not be included in aggregate service thereafter unless,
at the commencement of the next period of employment, the participant
repays to the fund the amount of such distribution with interest. For
purposes of this definition, interest shall accrue as of the date the employee

full-time police force, which amounts are paid directly by the employer
or through a program to which the employer has made contributions on
behalf of the employee, other than under this plan (including, without
limitation, a worker's compensation program or payments made under the
Pennsylvania Heart and Lung Act). Certain nonperiodic payments such as
bonuses, educational incentives, unused and earned vacation and sick-leave
buyback payments shall also be included in compensation. Compensation
shall be limited on an annual basis to the amount specified for government

B.
Salary used to determine final monthly average salary shall be limited
on an annual basis to the amount specified for government plans in
accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17), as adjusted under Code

§ 47-134. Retirement benefits.
B. Reduction of participant contributions. Notwithstanding the preceding
Subsection A, if an annual actuarial study performed by the actuary
shows that the condition of the pension fund is such that payments into
the pension fund by participants may be reduced below the minimum
percentages prescribed in Subsection A, or may be eliminated, and that
if such payments are reduced or eliminated, contributions by the
employer will not be required to keep the pension fund actuarially
sound, the employer may, by ordinance or resolution, reduce or
eliminate payments into the pension fund by participants.
C. Employer contributions. The actuary, in accordance with the Act, shall
determine the minimum municipal obligation of the employer. The
employer shall pay into the pension fund, by annual appropriations or
otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum
municipal obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall preclude the employer from contributing an amount in
excess of the minimum municipal obligation.
D. State aid. General municipal pension system state aid, or any other
amount of state aid received by the employer in accordance with the
Act from the commonwealth, may be deposited into the pension fund
governed by this plan in amounts determined by the Board and shall be
used to reduce the amount of the minimum municipal obligation of the
employer.
E. Gifts. The Board is authorized to take by gift, grant, devise or otherwise
any money or property, real or personal, for the benefit of the plan and
cause the same to be held as a part of the pension fund. The care,
management, investment and disposal of such amounts shall be vested
in the Board or its delegate, the plan administrator, subject to the
direction of the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and the
terms of the plan.
F. Employer reversion. At no time shall it be possible for the plan assets to
be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive
benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, including payment of
any reasonable plan expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake and the contribution is
returned within one year of the date on which the discovery of the
mistaken payment of the contribution was made or reasonably should
have been made or the plan is terminated, as provided in § 47-140.
A. Normal retirement. Each participant shall be entitled to a normal
retirement benefit after retirement on or after the participant has
attained normal retirement age.
B. Normal retirement benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled
to a benefit pursuant to Subsection A shall receive a benefit paid
§ 47-133 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-134
1:161
monthly in an amount equal to 50% of the participant's final monthly
average salary as determined herein. The normal retirement benefit
shall be computed as the sum of:
(1) Any pension benefits from pension plans heretofore established by
a private organization or association for the members of the police
force but only to the extent that the commonwealth or any of its
municipalities shall have contributed to such pension plan monies
raised by taxation;
(2) Seventy-five percent of primary social security benefits under the
Federal Social Security Act for which the participant may be
eligible because of age and attributable to employment, in the
event that a participant should be entitled to such benefits in the
future; and
(3) An amount from the plan to the extent necessary to make the total
benefit paid in any given month equal to 50% of final monthly
average salary.
C. Late retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age subject to the employer's rules
and regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met
the requirements of Subsection A continues in employment beyond
normal retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until
employment ceases and the participant's retirement actually begins.
The retirement benefit of a participant who retires after attainment of
normal retirement age shall be calculated in accordance with
Subsection B on the basis of the final monthly average salary as of such
participant's actual retirement and shall commence on the participant's
late retirement date.
D. Service increment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, each participant who shall retire after completing at least 26
years of aggregate service and each participant who shall have retired
after January 1, 1984, and who was disabled for more than 36 months
after completing at least 25 years of active employment, may be
entitled to receive a monthly service increment benefit; provided,
however, that the participant shall have accrued sufficient service
credit pursuant to this Subsection D. Such service increment benefit
shall only be available to a participant whose aggregate service for
purposes of this Subsection D shall only include periods of time when
the participant actively renders service in employment and shall not
include any period of time during which the participant received a
disability benefit under the terms of this plan or was not otherwise in
active employment. Such service increment benefit shall be in an
amount equal to $100 and shall be paid monthly in addition to the
amount of normal retirement benefit calculated pursuant to Subsection
B hereof.
§ 47-134 SHALER CODE § 47-134
1:162
E. Cost-of-living adjustments. Each participant who shall retire after
January 1, 2001, and receive a retirement benefit determined pursuant
to Subsection B hereunder shall be entitled to receive annual cost-ofliving
increases to the amount of benefit payable to such participant
under Subsection B. Such cost-of-living increases shall be determined
by the Board and shall not exceed the following limits:
(1) The percentage increase in the consumer price index from the year
in which the participant was last employed as an employee of the
employer;
(2) The total retirement benefits payable under this plan shall not
exceed 75% of the participant's final monthly average salary;
(3) Effective January 1, 2003, the total cost-of-living increase shall not
exceed 30% of the participant's original retirement benefit under
this plan; and
(4) The cost-of-living increases shall not impair the actuarial
soundness of the pension fund.
F. Payment of benefits. Retirement benefit payments shall be payable as of
the participant's retirement date and the first day of each month
thereafter during the participant's lifetime. The initial payment shall be
prorated based upon the remaining number of days in the then-current
month compared to 30. A participant must complete an application for
benefit in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator and deliver
such application to the plan administrator at least 30 days prior to the
date on which benefit payments shall commence. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit
payments or any other payments shall be due or payable on or before
the date that is 30 days after the date the plan administrator receives
the application for benefits. Payment of benefits under this section shall
cease as of the date of death of the participant.
G. Maximum benefit limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
plan to the contrary, no benefit provided under this plan attributable to
contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual amount, the
amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to
Code Section 415(d), assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight
life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The limitations described in this
Subsection G shall be governed by the following conditions and
definitions:
(1) Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to
the plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained
herein;
(2) In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of
age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on
§ 47-134 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-134
1:163
an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant
to this section commencing at age 62; however, the reduction shall
not reduce the limitation below $75,000 for a benefit commencing
at or after age 55 or, if the benefit commences prior to attainment
of age 55, the amount which is actuarially equivalent to a benefit of
$75,000 commencing at age 55; however, in the case of a qualified
participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least
15 years of service, including applicable military service, as a fulltime
employee of a police or fire department is taken into account
in determining the amount of benefit), the limitation contained
herein shall not reduce the limitation to an amount less than the
amount specified pursuant to Code Section 415(b)(2)(G)(i), and
such amount shall be adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d);
(3) In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age
65 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined herein
commencing at age 65;
(4) Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
section, provided that the employer has not at any time maintained
a defined contribution plan in which the participant has
participated; however, in the case of a participant who is not
receiving a disability retirement benefit pursuant to § 47-135B,
with fewer than 10 years of participation, the limitation expressed
in this Subsection G(4) shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of
participation less than 10, but in no event shall this limitation be
less than $1,000;
(5) The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all
defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one
defined contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted
consistent with Code Section 415 and regulations thereunder as
applicable to government plans in general and this plan in
particular; and
(6) In the case of a survivor benefit or a disability retirement benefit
under § 47-135B, the adjustment under Subsection G(2) hereof
shall not apply and the applicable limitation shall be the limitation
contained herein without regard to the age of the benefit recipient.
[Amended 4-13-2010 by Ord. No. 188357]
H. Required distributions.
57.Editor's Note: This ordinance shall take effect 4-14-2010.
§ 47-134 SHALER CODE § 47-134
1:164
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit
of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to death
shall be distributed either:
(a) Not later than the required beginning date; or
(b) Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior
to the date when the entire interest has been distributed after
distribution of the benefits has begun in accordance with
Subsection H(1)(b) above, the remaining portion of such benefit
shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of
distribution being used under Subsection H(1)(b) as of the date of
the death.
(3) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of the benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2; and further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this subsection shall be applied
as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
(4) For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) Required beginning date shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2 or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
§ 47-134 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-134
1:165
(b) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(c) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(d) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be recalculated but not more frequently than
annually.
I. Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not
be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process and shall be payable only to the participant or designated
beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer except as
required by an order of court entered by a state or federal court
exercising proper jurisdiction.
J. Retired participants. Any participant who shall have retired prior to the
restatement date shall not have the benefit altered in any way by the
provisions of this amended and restated plan, except where otherwise
expressly provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to
have their benefits governed by the terms of the plan in effect on the
day preceding the restatement date.
K. Limitation of liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
employer, the plan administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or
representative of any of the foregoing to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided
from the assets available in the pension fund, whether such benefits are
in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms of the plan. The
Board retains the right to amend or terminate this plan consistent with
applicable law at any time, with or without cause and whether or not
such action directly or indirectly results in the suspension, reduction or
termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay status, and
without liability to any person for any such action.
L. Personal right of participant. The right to receive any benefits under
this plan is a personal right of the participant and shall expire upon the
death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any
interest in any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so
provided by the terms of this plan or the provisions of applicable law. A
participant's election, failure to make an election or revocation of an
election hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons.
M. Nonduplication of benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under the plan and
§ 47-134 SHALER CODE § 47-134
1:166
who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit
payments, such participant shall receive the greater of the amount
of the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon final
monthly average salary and aggregate service as of the date that such
period of resumed employment shall cease.
N. Direct rollovers.
(1) This subsection applies to distributions made on or after December
31, 2001. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an
eligible rollover distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in
a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall
apply:
DIRECT ROLLOVER  A payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
DISTRIBUTEE  Includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse
and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse
who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations
order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), is a distributee with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN  A qualified trust described in
Code Section 401(a), an individual retirement account described
in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described
in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section
403(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), an
eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code, which is maintained
by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan.
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION 
Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include any distribution that is one of
a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution
(a)
§ 47-134 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-134
1:167
§ 47-135. Disability retirement.
to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section
401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the
exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section
of the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be
an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not
includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b)
A. Disability retirement. A participant who shall incur a total and
permanent disability before attaining normal retirement age shall be
entitled to a disability retirement benefit as of the disability date.
B. Disability retirement benefit. In accordance with Act 600, a disability
pension shall be calculated at a rate no less than 50% of the member's
salary at the time the disability was incurred, provided that any
member who receives benefits for the same injuries under the Social
Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.) shall have his/her
disability benefits offset or reduced by the amount of such benefits. A
participant who shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit under
Subsection A shall receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to 75%
of the participant's final monthly average salary for the final 36 months
of active service determined as of the disability date. Any such
participant who meets the age and service requirements for a normal
retirement benefit shall not be eligible for a disability retirement
benefit.
C. Payment of disability benefits.
(1) Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of
each month, commencing as of the first day of the month coincident
with or immediately following the participant's disability date and
continuing until the earliest of the death of the participant or
cessation of total and permanent disability.
(2) A participant who shall fail to return within three months to
employment as an employee of the employer upon cessation of total
and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement
age shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the
§ 47-134 SHALER CODE § 47-135
1:168
§ 47-136. Death benefits.
disability date and shall not be entitled to any distribution of
accumulated contributions pursuant to § 47-137B unless the total
amount of disability payments does not exceed the value of the
participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability date. If
the total amount of disability payments does not exceed the value
of the participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability
date in the case of a participant who shall be deemed to have
terminated employment as of the disability date hereunder, there
shall be payable under § 47-137B an amount equal to the difference
between the value of the participant's accumulated contributions
and the total amount of disability payments.
D. Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall determine
whether a participant shall have incurred a total and permanent
disability and shall rely on the findings of a panel of physicians that
shall be composed of one physician chosen by the employer, one
physician chosen by the employee, and one physician chosen by the
concurrence of the other two. If it shall be determined through this
procedure that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled
has recovered sufficiently to resume active employment as a police
officer or if a participant refuses to undergo a medical examination as
directed by the plan administrator (such a medical examination may not
be required more frequently than once in any given twelve-month
period), the payment of disability retirement benefits shall cease.
E. Cessation of disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this plan must notify the plan
administrator of any medical change indicating that the participant may
no longer be entitled to receive disability retirement benefits. If a
participant fails to provide prompt notice to the plan administrator of
any such change in status and continues to receive payment of
disability retirement benefits to which the participant is no longer
entitled, then the plan may take whatever action is necessary to recover
any such payments, including legal action or offsetting such amounts
against any future payments of retirement or other benefits under the
plan, including the costs of such actions, provided that an equivalent
position was available to the participant during the period of time when
he or she was no longer entitled to disability retirement benefits.
A. Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a participant,
there shall be benefits payable in accord with the following subsections
of this section.
B. Survivor benefit.58
58.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B, Killed in service, was repealed 4-13-2010 by Ord. No.
1883, effective 4-14-2010. This ordinance also provided for the redesignation of former
Subsections C and D as Subsections B and C, respectively.
§ 47-135 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-136
1:169
§ 47-137. Termination of employment.
(1) The surviving spouse of a participant or a participant who retires
on pension who dies, or if no spouse survives or if the spouse
survives and subsequently dies, then the child or children under
the age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or attaining the
age of 23 years, of a participant or a participant who retires on
pension who dies, shall during his/her lifetime in the case of a
surviving spouse or until reaching the age of 18 years or, if
attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years in the case
of a child or children, be entitled to receive a pension calculated at
50% of the pension the participant was receiving or would have
been receiving had the participant been retired at the time of the
participant's death. The shares payable to the surviving dependent
children shall be adjusted as each child ceases to be eligible to
receive a share of the benefit hereunder. ("Attending college" shall
mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited
institution of higher learning and are carrying a minimum class
load of seven credit hours per semester.)
(2) Instead of and in lieu of the survivor benefit set forth herein, the
surviving spouse of a participant who shall have died prior to the
commencement of payment of a retirement benefit under this plan
shall be permitted to elect to receive a distribution of the
participant's accumulated contributions, and no additional benefits
shall be due and payable under the plan.
C. Death of participant without a survivor benefit. If a participant shall die
before payment of a benefit has commenced and without eligibility for
payment of a survivor benefit, the beneficiary shall be eligible to receive
a distribution in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions of
the participant as of the date of death of the participant. If the
participant has received disability retirement benefits or any other
retirement benefits hereunder, the amount of distribution of
accumulated contributions shall be reduced by the amount of disability
retirement benefits or other retirement benefits which have been paid
hereunder. [Amended 4-13-2010 by Ord. No. 188359]
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this plan limited to those contained in the
following sections of this section.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. When a participant's
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other
than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of
normal retirement age, the participant shall be entitled to receive a
distribution of accumulated contributions. Upon receipt of such
59.Editor's Note: This ordinance shall take effect 4-14-2010.
§ 47-136 SHALER CODE § 47-137
1:170
§ 47-138. Administration.
accumulated contributions, said participant and beneficiary shall not be
entitled to any further payments from the plan.
C. Deferred retirement benefit. A participant who shall have completed at
least 12 years of aggregate service and whose employment shall
terminate for any reason other than due to death or total and
permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement age shall
be entitled to elect to vest retirement benefits under the plan by filing a
written notice of the intention to vest with the plan administrator within
90 days after the date employment ceases. Such an election to receive a
deferred retirement benefit shall be in lieu of a distribution of
accumulated contributions under Subsection B. Such a deferred
retirement benefit shall be equal to the participant's accrued benefit as
of the date employment terminates and shall commence after
application pursuant to § 47-134F and not earlier than the date which
would be the participant's normal retirement date under the plan if the
participant remained in employment until such date.
A. Plan administrator. The plan administrator shall be the Committee or
the individual appointed by the Board who shall have the power and
authority to do all acts and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all
instruments necessary to implement and effectuate the purpose of this
plan. The plan administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf
to any persons it deems appropriate. If a plan administrator is not
appointed, the Board shall be the plan administrator.
B. Pension and Insurance Committee. The Board shall appoint a Pension
and Insurance Committee to administer the affairs of the plan. The
Board shall delegate such authority as it shall deem appropriate to the
Committee. The Committee, if one is appointed, shall consist of not less
than five members. Two members of the Committee may be employees,
provided that such employees shall be nonvoting members. Each
member of the Committee shall serve in that capacity until death,
resignation, removal or otherwise. Each member may be removed at
any time, with or without cause, by the Board. Each member may resign
by delivering written notice to the Board and other members of the
Committee. Vacancies on the Committee shall be filled in the same
manner as the position was originally filled by the Board; provided,
however, that the remaining members of the Committee shall have full
power to act pending the filling of such vacancies.
C. Authority and duties of the plan administrator.
(1) The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the
proper administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation
or construction placed upon any term or provision of the plan by
the plan administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken
in good faith shall, upon the Board's review and approval thereof,
§ 47-137 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-138
1:171
be final and conclusive upon all parties hereto, whether employees,
participants or other persons concerned. By way of specification
and not limitation and except as specifically limited hereafter, the
plan administrator is authorized:
(a) To construe this plan;
(b) To determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any
employee to participate herein;
(c) To compute the amount and source of any benefit payable
hereunder to any participant or beneficiary;
(d) To authorize any and all disbursements;
(e) To prescribe any procedure to be followed by any participant
or other person in filing any application or election;
(f) To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required
by law or as the plan administrator deems appropriate,
information explaining the plan;
(g) To require from the employer or any participant such
information as shall be necessary for the proper administration
of the plan; and
(h) To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the
administration of the plan, including such legal, clerical,
accounting and actuarial services as may be required by any
applicable law or laws.
(2) The plan administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from
or modify the terms of the plan or change or add to any benefits
provided by the plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements
of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the plan
administrator shall have no power to adopt, amend or terminate
the plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to determine or require
any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Board.
D. Pension and Insurance Committee organization. The Committee may
organize itself in any manner deemed appropriate to effectuate its
purposes hereunder, provided that it shall operate and act by a majority
of its members at the time in office either by vote at a meeting or in
writing without a meeting. The Committee shall appoint a Chairman, a
Secretary who may, but need not, be a Committee member, and such
other agents as it may deem advisable. The Committee may authorize
any one or more of its members to execute any document or documents,
including any application, request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver
or direction, and shall notify the Board, in writing, of each such member
so authorized; however, if no such member is so authorized, the
Chairman shall be deemed to be so authorized. Any trustee or other
§ 47-138 SHALER CODE § 47-138
1:172
fiduciary appointed hereunder shall accept and be fully protected in
relying upon any document executed by the designated members (or
the Chairman in the absence of a designation), as representing a valid
action by the Committee until the Committee shall file with such
fiduciary a written revocation of such designation. The Committee shall
meet at least one time in each plan year, and it shall maintain and
keep such records as are necessary for the efficient operation of the
plan or as may be required by any applicable law, regulation or ruling,
and shall provide for the preparation and filing of such forms, reports
or documents as may be required to be filed with any governmental
agency or department and with the participants or other persons
entitled to benefits under the plan.
E. Plan administrator costs. The plan administrator shall serve without
compensation for services unless otherwise agreed by the Board in
writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the functioning of the plan
administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants,
counsel, actuaries and other specialists, and other costs of
administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the Board to the extent permitted under applicable law and
not otherwise paid by the employer.
F. Hold harmless. No member of the Board, the plan administrator, the
enrolled actuary, nor any other person involved in the administration of
the plan shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to
act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing
their respective duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent
permitted by law, the employer shall, and hereby does agree to,
indemnify and hold harmless the plan administrator and each successor
and each of any such individual's heirs, executors and administrators,
and the delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or
corporation which is independent of the employer and which renders
services to the plan for a fee) from any and all liability and expenses,
including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit or
proceeding to which such person is or may be made a party by reason of
being or having been a member, delegate or appointee of the plan
administrator, except in matters involving criminal liability, intentional
or willful misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover
claims of a nature described above, then there shall be no right of
indemnification except to the extent of any deductible amount under
the insurance coverage or to the extent of the amount the claims exceed
the insured amount.
G. Approval of benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
H. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
§ 47-138 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-138
1:173
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant") shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth:
(a) The specific plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(b) An explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(c) An explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Board of the initial
determination. Such request for review must be made by notice to
the Board within 60 days of receipt of such notice of denial. During
such review, the claimant or a duly authorized representative shall
have the right to review any pertinent documents and to submit any
issues or comments in writing. The Board shall, within 60 days
after receipt of the notice requesting such review (or in special
circumstances, such as where the Board in its sole discretion holds
a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice), submit its
decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been
denied. The decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties, shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by
the claimant and shall contain specific references to the pertinent
plan provisions on which the decision is based.
(4) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(5) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
§ 47-138 SHALER CODE § 47-138
1:174
§ 47-139. Pension fund.
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
(6) Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to appeal any final decision hereunder to a court of
competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be
taken until the entire appeal procedure of this Subsection H of the
plan has been exhausted.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Board is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject to the
provisions of the laws of the commonwealth and of this plan and
any amendment thereto.
(2) The pension fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the
plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the
expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.
(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the pension fund required under the plan. The
employer shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in
the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the pension fund,
and only to the extent that there are monies available therein. The
pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer under
the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions
hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof.
The pension fund shall be held, managed and administered
pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the plan, the employer has exclusive authority and
discretion to manage and control the pension fund assets. The
employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian or investment
manager, at its sole discretion.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition
to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law, unless such duties
are delegated:
(1) To retain in cash so much of the pension fund as it deems advisable
and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial
institution (including any such institution which may be appointed
to serve as trustee hereunder), without liability for interest
thereon.
§ 47-138 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-139
1:175
(2) To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and
keep said fund invested, without distinction between principal and
income, in securities which are at the time legal investments for
fiduciaries under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act,60 or
as the same may be subsequently modified or amended.
(3) To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
exchange such property; to grant options for the purchase or
exchange thereof.
(4) To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting
property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease,
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation
pursuant to any such plan.
(5) To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the fund.
(6) To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
fund and, in connection therewith, to grant proxies, discretionary
or otherwise.
(7) To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed to be
appropriate for the purposes of this plan no matter where situated,
including, in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve
as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
(8) In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
(9) To maintain and invest the assets of this plan on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans
maintained by the employer, provided that the assets of each
respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
(10) To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
60.Editor's Note: See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
§ 47-139 SHALER CODE § 47-139
1:176
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the plan, provided that if a trustee is
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make
payment or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(14) To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the pension fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to
the interest of any person therein which the fund is required to pay;
to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against
or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.

accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that act),
or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose
of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in
such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition

1:177
§ 47-140. Amendment and termination.
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts
or omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it
be under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
C. Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest
contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days' written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same or to be
reimbursed for the payment thereof from the pension fund.
E. Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually or at more frequent intervals by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
A. Amendment of the plan. The employer may amend this plan at any time
or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name
of the employer under its Municipal Seal by officers duly authorized to
§ 47-139 SHALER CODE § 47-140
1:178
execute such instrument and delivered to the Board; provided,
however:
(1) That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any
beneficiary of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which
each is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this plan other than for the benefit of employees, and no
funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan shall, except as
provided in Subsection E, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by
the employer; and
(3) That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 47-141C has been prepared and presented to the Board in
accordance with the Act.
B. Termination of the plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in
writing executed in the name of the employer.
C. Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the pension fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment
for the benefit of its creditors.
D. Distribution upon termination.
(1) In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan,
the employer shall direct either:
(a) That the plan administrator continue to hold the vested
accrued benefits of participants in the pension fund in
accordance with the provisions of the plan (other than those
provisions related to forfeitures), without regard to such
termination, until all funds have been distributed in
accordance with the provisions; or
(b) That the plan administrator immediately distribute to each
participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to
the date.
(2) If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority
shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to
§ 47-140 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-140
1:179
§ 47-141. Funding standard requirements.
mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are
applied to the distribution of any vested benefits attributable to
other sources hereunder.
(3) All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be
distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination.
E. Residual assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the pension fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of law, and any
remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions, shall be
returned to the commonwealth.
F. Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension fund,
after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their
beneficiaries or their estates.
A. Actuarial valuations.
(1) The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least
biennially unless the employer is applying or has applied for
supplemental state assistance pursuant to Section 603 of the Act61,
whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
(2) Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the
beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered
calendar year, beginning with the year 1985.
(3) Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an
approved actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
(4) The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or investigation required by the Act or any other
expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and which
are directly associated with administering the plan shall be an
allowable administrative expense payable from the assets of the
pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include but not be
limited to the following:
61.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 895.603.
§ 47-140 SHALER CODE § 47-141
1:180
§ 47-142. Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) Investment costs associated with obtaining authorized
investments and investment management fees;
(b) Accounting expenses;
(c) Premiums for insurance coverage on fund assets;
(d) Reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or
to defend the fund; and
(e) Legitimate travel and education expenses for plan officials;
provided, however, that the municipal officials of the employer,
in their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services provided to
the plan to ensure that the expenses are necessary, reasonable
and benefit the plan; and further provided that the plan
administrator shall document all such expenses item by item
and, where necessary, hour by hour.
B. Duties of chief administrative officer.
(1) Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the chief administrative officer.
(2) The chief administrative officer of the plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the plan on the basis of the most recent
actuarial report and shall determine the minimum municipal
obligation of the employer with respect to funding the plan for any
given plan year. The chief administrative officer shall submit the
financial requirements of the plan and the minimum municipal
obligation of the employer to the Board annually and shall certify
the accuracy of such calculations and their conformance with the
Act.
C. Benefit plan modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the chief administrative officer of the plan
shall provide to the Board a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary,
which estimate shall disclose to the Board the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the
plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the employer with
respect to the plan.
A. Employment rights. No employee of the employer, nor any other person,
shall have any rights whatsoever against the employer or the plan
administrator as a result of this plan except those expressly granted
hereunder. Participation in this plan shall not give any right to any
employee to be retained in the employ of the employer, nor shall it
interfere with the right of the employer to discharge any employee and
to deal with such employee without regard to the effect such treatment
might have upon participation in this plan.
§ 47-141 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-142
1:181
B. Meaning of certain words. For purposes of this plan, the masculine
gender shall include the feminine gender and the singular shall include
the plural, and vice versa, in all cases wherever the person or context
shall plainly so require. Headings of articles and sections are inserted
only for convenience of reference and are not to be considered in the
construction of the plan.
C. Information to be furnished by the employer. The employer shall furnish
to the plan administrator (and, where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the plan.
D. Severability of provisions. Should any provisions of this plan be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan shall be construed
and enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been
inserted herein.
E. Incapacity of participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining the
participant and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for
the participant, may provide for such payment of pension benefits
hereunder to such person or institution so maintaining the participant,
and any such payments so made shall be deemed for every purpose to
have been made to such participant.
F. Pension fund for sole benefit of participants. The income and principal
of the pension fund are for the sole use and benefit of the participants
covered hereunder, and to the extent permitted by law shall be free,
clear and discharged from and are not to be in any way liable for debts,
contracts or agreements now contracted or which may hereafter be
contracted and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred
by any participant or beneficiary.
G. Benefits for a deceased participant. If any benefit shall be payable
under the plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the plan
provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the
participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate
is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan
administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving
spouse of such deceased participant or, if there is no surviving spouse,
to such participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent the plan administrator from
insisting upon the commencement of estate administration proceedings
and the delivery of any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or
administrator.

1:182

otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past,

amount to an IRA or individual retirement annuity (other than an
endowment contract), provided that:

personal injury will be governed as follows:
(a) The permittee shall indemnify fully and, if requested, defend
the Township from liability, loss, injury or damage to persons
or property which the Township, its officers, agents and
employees individually may suffer as a result of claims,
demands, costs or judgments arising against it as a result of
the granting of the blasting permit to the permittee, including
claims, demands, costs or judgments arising as a result of
activities of the permittee, its agents, employees or others at
the permit site or work or other actions taken by one or more
of them under or in violation of the permit; or as a result of the
failure of one or more of them to conform to pertinent statutes,
ordinances, regulations or other requirements or other
requirements of a governmental authority in connection with
the permit.
(b) The permittee and its contractors shall add the Township as
an additional insured to their insurance policies to secure

and at least $1,000,000 per occurrence or other statutory

coverage for damages and injury which occur during the time

of the permit to the permittee.
(d) Upon request, the permittee shall deliver to the Township
certificates of insurance evidencing that the coverage required
under this subsection has been obtained.

the permit, a policy of insurance, issued by an insurer having a
certificate of authority and a licensed agent authorized to transact
the business of insurance in this commonwealth, to cover a loss
that may arise out of operations under the permit.

under this subsection has been obtained.
(d) The permittee's obligations to indemnify the Township and
to obtain insurance to secure indemnification as required in
Subsection G(1) herein and its obligation to obtain security
under Subsection G(3) herein are separate from the
obligations to obtain insurance for the purposes required
under Subsection G(2). Obtaining insurance under this
Subsection G(2) does not relieve the permittee of its
obligations under Subsection G(1) and (3).
(3) Security. The Township may require the applicant to execute an
agreement or provide security, or both, as a prerequisite to
issuance of the permit. The Township's determination as to the

of the circumstances existing concerning the blasting. If security
is required, it shall be delivered to the Township Treasurer in the
form and amount acceptable to the Township and shall guarantee
restoration of all property damaged by operations under the
permit for at least one year after the expiration of the permit.

Township, signed by a bank officer and naming the Township

(1) Rate application. If the franchising authority is unable to determine

submitted by the cable operator(s), whether the current rates for
the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation
necessary to receive the basic service tier and/or the proposed rate
increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising
authority may, in cases not involving cost-of-service showings, take
an additional 90 days to consider the rate application.
§ 97-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-4
1:251
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the
same upon the cable operator(s), indicating that additional
time is required to consider the rate application. The order
shall be issued prior to the expiration of the 30 days during
which the franchising authority may consider the rate
application. Within seven days of issuance of such order, the
franchising authority shall publish notice in a newspaper of
general circulation within the jurisdiction of the franchising
authority, which notice shall contain a summary of the order,
including the additional time requested and the reason for

in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current
rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate, the
franchising authority may only require furnishing of

amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose
behalf such amounts were paid.

submitted a cost-of-service rate application and the franchising
authority is unable to determine whether the cable rates for the

increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising
authority may take an additional 150 days to consider the cost-ofservice
rate application.
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the
same upon the cable operator(s) indicating that additional time
is required to consider the rate application because it is a cost-

the expiration of the 30 days during which the franchising
authority may consider the rate application. Within seven days
of issuance of such order, the franchising authority shall
publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation within
the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice shall
contain a summary of the order, including the additional time
requested and the reason for requesting such additional time.
(b) The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to
furnish additional specified information, including proprietary
information, when the current rate or proposed rate increase is
in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current
rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate, the
franchising authority may only require furnishing of
documentation that the rate is within the maximum permitted
rate. Any proprietary information furnished to the franchising
authority shall be retained as confidential in conformity with
regulations adopted by the FCC in this regard, a copy of which
regulations are on file with and available for review upon
request to the franchising authority.
(c) If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the
expiration of the additional time, the current rates or proposed
rate increase shall become effective, subject to any later
refund order adopted by the franchising authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchising authority, in
order to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order,

amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose
behalf such amounts were paid.

(a) The rate application is not approved, in whole or in part, by the
franchising authority.
(b) The rate application is approved by the franchising authority
over the objection(s) of any interested party.
(2) The franchising authority may, but is not required to, issue a
written opinion when the rate application is approved and there
have been no objections filed.
(3) Within seven days of issuance of an opinion, the franchising
authority shall provide notice in a newspaper of general circulation
within the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice
shall contain, at a minimum, that:
§ 97-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-4
1:253
(a) The franchising authority has reached a decision on the rate
application and announcing that decision;
(b) The manner in which interested parties may review and/or
obtain copies of the opinion;

opinion of the franchising authority; and
(d) The deadline for taking any such appeal.
(4) Notice of the opinion of the franchising authority shall be provided
to the cable operator(s) by mail within seven days of issuance.
D. Disapproval of the rate application.
(1) Rate reduction.
(a) Current rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an
opinion disapproving the current rates of the cable operator(s)
for the basic service tier or for rates for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier, the
franchising authority may order a reduction in the current
rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier. The
prospective rate adjustment may be set at:
[1] A level consistent with the FCC-adopted maximum
permitted rates;
[2] Another rate, based on review of a cost-of-service rate
application; or
[3] Another rate consistent with FCC rules.
(b) Proposed rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an
opinion disapproving of any proposed rate increase, the
franchising authority may:
[1] Prescribe a reasonable rate to be charged by the cable
operator(s) instead of the proposed rate. The prescribed
rate may not be lower than the maximum permitted rate
unless a cost-of-service rate application has been
submitted by the cable operator(s) and the franchising
authority determines that the cost-of-service analysis
justifies a lower rate; or
[2] Advise the cable operator(s) of a rate level to which it
would not object if a modified rate application were
resubmitted.
(2) Refunds. The franchising authority may order a refund if:
§ 97-4 SHALER CODE § 97-4
1:254
§ 97-5. Customer service standards.
(a) The cable operator failed to comply with a rate decision by the
franchising authority. The refund period may be retroactive to
the effective date of the rate order issued by the franchising
authority.
(b) The franchising authority determines in its initial review of the
current rates that they exceed the maximum permitted rates
and are unsupported by a cost-of-service rate application. In
such instance, the refund period may be retroactive to
September 1, 1993, or one year prior to the date on which the
cable operator(s) implement(s) the prospective rate
adjustment, whichever is shorter.
(c) The franchising authority has issued an order permitting it to
take an additional 90 days or 150 days to consider a rate
application and has directed the cable operator(s) to keep an
accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate
in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid but failed
to issue an opinion during the time period, causing the rates to
become provisionally effective, and the franchising authority
later finds all or a portion of the rates to be unreasonable. In
such instance, the refund period may be retroactive to the date
of the order and ending on the date on which the cable
operator(s) implements the prospective rate reduction or one
year, whichever is shorter.
(3) Before any refund order shall become effective, the franchising
authority must send notice to the cable operator(s), and provide
said cable operator(s) a maximum of 30 days to submit additional
information to the franchising authority as to why the refund
should not be ordered. At the end of said period, the franchising
authority shall either confirm, amend or rescind said refund order.
(4) Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax payments.
(5) If any proposed rate increase has gone into effect due to inaction of
the franchising authority or the failure of the franchising authority
to issue an order stating a need for additional time, the franchising
authority has no right to order a refund.
(6) Any violation of any order issued hereunder shall be considered a
violation of this article.
A. Within 90 days of receipt by the cable operator(s) of written notice from
the franchising authority of the franchising authority's intention to
monitor and enforce the customer service standards adopted by the
FCC, a copy of which are attached hereto as Exhibit A77 and

franchising authority that the subscriber should contact to report any
violation or alleged violation of said customer service standards.

violation of the customer service standards by the cable operator(s) or
upon discovery of a violation of its own accord shall provide notice of
the same to the cable operator(s), who may respond thereto within 10
days of said notice.
D. Any failure of the cable operator(s) to cure a violation of the customer
service standards within such time as shall be set by the franchising
authority or to timely respond to a notice from the franchising authority
regarding a violation shall be a violation of this article.
A. Cumulative remedies. Where this article provides alternative penalties
or remedies, they shall be cumulative, and the imposition of one penalty
or remedy shall not prevent the franchising authority from invoking any
other penalty or remedy provided herein.
B. In addition to all other rights and remedies provided herein, the
franchising authority shall have all rights and remedies afforded under
the franchise agreement.
C. Unless otherwise provided, any person convicted of violating any
provision of this article, including any order issued or any rule or
regulation promulgated hereunder, shall, upon conviction, be fined not
more than $300 and costs for each offense and, in default of payment

may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure after the

against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred
by the Township.
(3) Transferring of funds. When transferring the funds as required in
Subsection C of this section, an insurance company, association or
§ 122-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 122-5
1:287

of the named insured, whereupon the Township shall contact the

or secures the property, the Building Inspector shall inspect the
property prior to the Township releasing any escrow funds. If the
named insured properly repairs, demolishes or secures the
property, the Building Inspector shall notify the Manager of such
completion. If the named insured fails to properly repair, demolish
or secure the property, the Township may choose to do so, and the
funds escrowed shall be applied to the Township costs incurred.

fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal
or securing of the building or other structure have been completed
and the required proof received by the Manager, if the Township
has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing.
(6) Payment of costs to the Township from funds when Township has
incurred costs. If the Township has incurred costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs
shall be paid from the funds, and if excess funds remain, the
Township shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.
(7) Insufficient funds to pay Township costs. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to limit the ability of the Township to recover any
deficiency.

Subsection D shall be construed to prohibit the Township and the
named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the
transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
E. Discharge of insurance obligation. Proof of payment by the insurance
company, association or exchange of proceeds under a policy in
accordance with Subsection C of this section is conclusive evidence of
the discharge of its obligation to the insured under the policy to the
extent of the payment and of compliance by the company, association or
exchange with Subsection C of this section.
F. No additional obligations created. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to make an insurance company, association or exchange
liable for any amount in excess of proceeds payable under its insurance
policy or for any other act performed pursuant to this chapter or to
make the Township or public official an insured under a policy of
insurance or to create an obligation to pay delinquent property taxes or

C. Every such fireworks display within the limits of the Township shall be
handled, arranged, managed and directly supervised by a licensed and
certified operator. Every such fireworks use and display within the
Township shall be of such a character and so located, discharged or
fired as not to be hazardous to property or endanger any person or
persons. The Township Fire Marshal or other such officer as may be
designated by the Township shall inspect the site where the fireworks
are to be used and displayed prior to the issuance of a permit in
accordance with the International Fire Code and other applicable
regulations and ensure that the site and proposed fireworks display are
compliant with said regulations. No permit for the use of fireworks shall
be issued until the Township Fire Marshal or other such officer as may
be designated by the Township determines that the requested permit
may be granted after inspecting the location for the requested display.
A. An application for a permit shall be made in writing to the Township at
least 30 days in advance of the date of the proposed use and display and
shall set forth the proposed date, time and location of the use and
display, the character and duration thereof, the name and address of
the competent operator, and the name and address of the owner or
owners of the grounds on which the use and display is to be held,
together with the written consent of such owner or owners thereto, and
a copy of any permit application required by the International Fire
Code. The application for the permit shall also contain copies of any and
all state, federal and/or county permits and/or licenses needed for the
use and display of fireworks. All applicants shall pay the Township the
appropriate reasonable permit fee as set by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners from time to time before the issuance of a permit. The
Township Board of Commissioners may attach conditions and/or
§ 127-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-7

§ 127-8. Stopping fireworks for violations or public safety.
In the event of any violation of this chapter or of the terms, conditions or
limitations noted on a permit for the display of fireworks, or in the event of
any unsafe condition occurring before or during the course of a fireworks
display, or in the event of any unsafe condition occurring as a result of
restrictions on any permit for the use and display of fireworks as it may
in its sole discretion deem necessary.
B. If and after such permit is granted by the Township Board of
Commissioners or an authorized designee, the possession, use and
display of fireworks for the approved display shall be lawful for that
purpose, date and time only and will automatically expire at the
conclusion of the display for which the permit has been issued. No
permit granted hereunder shall be transferable.
C. No permit for the use and display of fireworks shall be issued to an
individual under the age of 18.
D. The Board of Commissioners of the Township of Shaler shall require
liability insurance deemed adequate by the Board from the applicant,
permittee or licensee in an amount deemed appropriate by the Board of
Commissioners. The liability insurance amount shall be no less than
$2,000,000 and shall list Shaler Township, the Board of Commissioners,
individually and collectively, as well as the Township employees, agents
and consultants, as additional insureds. The liability insurance shall be
in a form acceptable to the Township, and no permit for a fireworks
display shall be issued unless an acceptable certificate of insurance
evidencing the required coverage is received by the Township.
E. If by reason of unfavorable weather the fireworks display for which a
permit has been granted does not take place at the time so authorized,
the person to whom such permit was issued may, the following business
day, apply to the Township and set forth under oath the fact that such
use and display was not made, the reason the use and display did not
take place, and a request for a continuance of such permit for a day
designated therein. The continuance date shall be no later than one
week (seven days) after the day fixed originally in said permit. Upon
receiving such application for a continuance, the Township, if it believes
the facts stated therein are true, may extend the provisions of said
permit to the day fixed in said application, no later than one week
(seven days) after the original day designated in the permit, and such
extension of time shall be granted without the payment of any
additional fee and without requiring any insurance other than the
certificate of insurance given for the original permit, provided that the
provisions of the original certificate of insurance extend to and cover all
damages which may be caused by reason of said use and display taking
place at such extended date in the same manner and to the same extent
as if such use and display had taken place at the date originally fixed in
the permit.

ARTICLE II
General Provisions
§ 130-4. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,91 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Township of Shaler
does hereby order as follows.
§ 130-5. Intent.
The intent of this part is to:
§ 130-6. Applicability.
§ 130-7. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This part supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect
in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more
A. Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Township of Shaler unless a permit
has been obtained from the floodplain administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures.

restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this part,
the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 130-8. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this part is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This part does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This part shall not create liability on the part of the Township of Shaler
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this part or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
B. In the absence of a designated floodplain administrator, the floodplain
administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the Township Manager.
A. The floodplain administrator shall issue a permit only after it has been
determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in
conformance with the requirements of this and all other applicable
codes and ordinances.
B. Prior to the issuance of any permit, the floodplain administrator shall
review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been
obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities
Act (Act 1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended); the Pennsylvania
Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and the U.S. Clean
Water Act, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall be issued
until this determination has been made.
C. In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the floodplain administrator shall review the
history of repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss
concerns can be addressed before the permit is issued.
D. During the construction period, the floodplain administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work
§ 130-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-11
1:311
§ 130-12. Application procedures and requirements.

ordinances. He/she shall make as many inspections during and upon
completion of the work as are necessary.
E. In the discharge of his/her duties, the floodplain administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or
development in the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of
proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of
this part.
F. In the event the floodplain administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the floodplain administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the Board of Commissioners
for whatever action it considers necessary.
G. Whenever the Building Inspector or other authorized municipal
representative determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe
that a violation of this part or of any regulation adopted pursuant
thereto has occurred or is occurring, he shall notify the owner of the
property on which the violation has occurred or is occurring. Notice
shall be written, include a description of the violation and an outline of
the remedial action which will effect compliance with this part or any
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, and shall establish a reasonable
time period within which remedial action must be taken. Notice shall be
served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may require;
provided, however, that such notice shall be deemed to have been
properly served upon such owner or agent when a copy thereof has
been served by any method or in any manner authorized by law.
H. The floodplain administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all records
associated with the requirements of this part, including, but not limited
to, finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection and
enforcement.
I. The floodplain administrator is the official responsible for submitting a
biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
J. The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments
of the floodplain administrator can be delegated from the person
identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person
identified in this part as the floodplain administrator/manager.
K. The floodplain administrator shall consider the requirements of Title 34
Pennsylvania Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC, or latest
revisions thereof.

manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
C. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
floodplain administrator to approve such a request, and the original
permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the

municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this part,
or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the floodplain
administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(3) Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for the
performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state;
(5) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this part.
§ 130-16 SHALER CODE § 130-17
1:316
§ 130-18. Appeals.
§ 130-19. Hearings.
B. Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation or group of individuals who or
which fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or provisions of
this part or who fails or refuses to comply with any notice, order or
direction of the floodplain administrator or any other authorized
employee of the municipality shall pay a fine to the Township of Shaler
of not less than $25 nor more than $1,000, plus costs of prosecution,
and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration not exceeding 90
days in the Allegheny County Jail. In addition to the above penalties, all
other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity, for the
proper enforcement of this part. The imposition of a fine or penalty for
any violation of or noncompliance with this part shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or
any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in noncompliance with this part may be declared by the
Board of Commissioners to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
A. Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the floodplain
administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of this
part may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be
filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or
action of the floodplain administrator.
B. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the appeal in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code and
any other local ordinance.
C. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board may
seek relief therefrom by appeal to court, as provided by the laws of this
state, including the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act.
A. Any person aggrieved by any notice which has been issued in
connection with the enforcement of the provisions of this part or any
regulation adopted pursuant thereto may request and shall be granted
a hearing on the matter before the Zoning Hearing Board of Shaler
Township, provided that such person shall file with the Township
Zoning Officer a written petition requesting such a hearing and setting
forth a brief statement of the grounds thereof within 10 days after the
notice was served. The filing of the request for a hearing shall operate
as a stay of the notice and suspension unless, in the opinion of the
Zoning Officer, to permit the work to continue would jeopardize the
safety of persons or property. On receipt of such petition, the Zoning
Officer shall record the same and place the petition on the agenda of
the Zoning Hearing Board; such meeting shall be no later than 40 days
from date of receipt of the petition.
§ 130-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-19
1:317
B. After hearing such petition, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make
findings as to compliance with the provisions of this part and
regulations issued thereunder and shall issue an order, in writing,
sustaining, modifying or withdrawing the notice, which shall be served
as provided in Chapter 225, Zoning, of the Code of the Township of
Shaler for any matters coming before the Zoning Hearing Board. The
proceedings at the hearing, including the findings and decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board, together with a copy of every notice and order
related thereto, shall be entered as a matter of public record in the
Township files, but the transcript of the proceedings need not be
transcribed except upon request of a party, at his expense. Any person
aggrieved by a decision of the Township may seek relief therefrom in
any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 130-20. Identification.
§ 130-21. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be: any areas of Township of Shaler
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs),
dated September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Township of Shaler and
declared to be a part of the ordinance.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway
has been delineated.
§ 130-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-21
1:319
§ 130-22. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Commissioners where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community

of the start and completion of each continuous grading operation.
Notice shall be received by the administrator or at his office at least two
working days before the start of completion of grading operation.
B. Grading work at these stages or at any other time will be subject to spot
inspections, at the discretion of the administrator, to determine that the
work is being performed in compliance with these regulations.
C. In cases when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil, as
recognized by the soil survey or better, the administrator may require
special precautions from the grader, which precautions shall be in
accordance with sound engineering practice. The results of all soil tests
and core borings made relating to the site graded shall be submitted to
the administrator.
A. General. All grading operations for which a permit is required shall be
subject to inspection by the Township. When required by the Township,
special inspection of grading operations and special testing shall be
performed in accordance with the provisions of § 140-14C.
B. Grading designation. All grading in excess of 5,000 cubic yards shall be
performed in accordance with the approved grading plan prepared by a
civil engineer and shall be designated as "engineered grading." Grading
involving less than 5,000 cubic yards may also be designated as
"engineered grading" by the Township, if the grading will:
(1) Support a building or structure of a permanent nature;
(2) Support other engineering works, such as, but not limited to, tanks,
towers, machinery, retaining wall and paving;
(3) Be deemed a potential hazard under § 140-6. The permittee, with
the approval of the Township, may also choose to have the grading
performed as "engineered grading." Otherwise, the grading shall
be designated as "regular grading."
C. Engineered grading requirements.
(1) For engineered grading, it shall be the responsibility of the civil
engineer who prepares the approved grading plan to incorporate
all recommendations from the soil engineering and engineering
geology reports into the grading plan. He shall also be responsible
for the professional inspection and approval of the grading within
his area of technical specialty. This responsibility shall include, but
§ 140-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 140-14
1:359
need not be limited to, inspection and approval as to the
establishment of line, grade and drainage of the development area.
The civil engineer shall act as the coordinating agent in the event
that need arises for liaison between the other professionals, the
contractor and the Township. The civil engineer shall also be
responsible for the preparation of revised plans and the submission
of as-graded grading plans upon completion of the work. The
grading contractor shall submit in a form prescribed by the
Township a statement of compliance to said as-graded plan.
(2) Soil engineering and engineering geology reports shall be required
as specified in this chapter. During grading, all necessary reports,
compaction data, and soil engineering and engineering geology
recommendations shall be submitted to the civil engineer and the
Township by the soil engineer and the engineering geologist. The
soil engineer's area of responsibility shall include, but need not be
limited to, the professional inspection and approval concerning the
preparation of ground to receive fills, testing for required
compaction, stability of all finish slopes, and the design of buttress
fills, where required, incorporating data supplied by the
engineering geologist.
(3) The engineering geologist's area of responsibility shall include, but
need not be limited to, professional inspection and approval of the
adequacy of natural ground for receiving fills and the stability of
cut slopes with respect to geological matters, and the need for
subdrains or other groundwater drainage devices. He shall report
the findings to the soil engineer and the civil engineer for
engineering analysis.
(4) The Township shall inspect the project at the various stages of work
requiring approval and at more frequent intervals necessary to
determine that adequate control is being exercised by the
professional consultants.
D. Regular grading requirements. The Township may require inspection
and testing by an approved testing agency. The testing agency's
responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, approval
concerning the inspection of cleared areas and benches to receive fill
and the compaction of fills. When the Township has cause to believe
that geological factors may be involved, the grading operation will be
required to conform to engineered grading requirements.
E. Notification of noncompliance. If in the course of fulfilling its
responsibilities under this chapter the civil engineer, the soil engineer,
the engineering geologist, or the testing agency finds that the work is
not being done in conformity with this chapter or the approved grading
plans, the discrepancies shall be reported immediately in writing to the
person in charge of the grading work and to the Township.
Recommendations for corrective measures, if necessary, shall be
submitted.

engineer, the engineering geologist, or the testing agency of record are
changed during the course of the work, the work shall be stopped until
the replacement has agreed to accept the responsibility within the area
of its technical competence for approval upon completion of the work.
A. Final reports. Upon completion of the rough grading work and the final
completion of the work the Township may require, the following reports
and drawings and supplements thereto must be provided:
(1) An as-graded grading plan prepared by the civil engineer, including
original ground surface elevations, as-graded ground surface
elevations, lot drainage patterns, and locations and elevations of all
surface and subsurface drainage facilities. The civil engineer shall
provide approval that the work was done in accordance with the
final approved grading plan.
(2) A soil grading report prepared by the soil engineer, including
locations and elevations of field density tests, summaries of field
and laboratory tests, and other substantiating data and comments
on any changes made during grading, and their effect on the
recommendations made in the soil engineering investigation
report. He shall provide approval as to the adequacy of the site for
the intended use.
(3) A geological grading report prepared by the engineering geologist,
including a final description of the geology of the site, including any
new information disclosed during the grading and the effect of
same on recommendations incorporated in the approved grading
plan. The civil engineer shall provide approval as to the adequacy
of the site for the intended use as affected by geological factors.
B. Notification of completion. The permittee or his agent shall notify the
Township when the grading operation is ready for final inspection. Final
approval shall not be given until all work, including installation of all
drainage facilities and their protective devices and all erosion control
measures, has been completed in accordance with the final approved
grading plan, and the required reports have been submitted.
C. Maintenance.
(1) The owner of any property on which an excavation or fill has been
made shall maintain in good condition and repair the excavation or
fill permitted and also all retaining walls, cribbing, drainage
structures, fences, ground cover and any other protective devices
as may be a part of the permit requirements.

cut face or fill slope shall evidence signs of deterioration, erosion or
other evidence which might be detrimental to the properties above
§ 140-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 140-15
1:361
§ 140-16. Expiration of permit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within
one year or if it is not completed within the time indicated on the permit,
said completion date not to exceed one year from the date on which the
Township receives written notification that work has commenced, provided
that the governing body, acting upon the recommendation of the
administrator, may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that
unusual difficulties have prevented work from being started or completed
within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time; and
provided, further, that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit. Any physical changes in the site,
such as surface water drainage, soil and bedrock dislocations, alteration
of groundwater discharge or any other natural or man-made modification
which would cause a doubt to be cast upon the feasibility of the contents
of the original permit approval, must be reported to the administrator in
the intervening period between approval of permit and completion of the
project.
§ 140-17. Denial of permit; appeal.
and below the grading site, the administrator may direct the
property owner to take necessary remedial steps in accordance
with sound engineering practice to restore the grading to a safe
condition and to do so in a reasonable period of time.
A. When the requirements of this chapter for obtaining a permit have been
met, the administrator shall approve the proposed plan and grant a
grading permit to the applicant. Approved work may then start.
However, when, in the opinion of the administrator, work proposed by
the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person or any street
or alley or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall be
denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger
property or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the
administrator shall give due consideration to possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoffs, surface waters and subsurface
conditions, such as the stratification and faulting of rock, aquifers,
springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock. Any party aggrieved
by the decision of the administrator shall appeal the administrator's
decision to the governing body within 30 days of receipt of notice of
such decision.
B. The governing body shall, within 45 days of the filing of an appeal from
the decision of the administrator, consider the alternate methods,
standards or materials proposed by the developer when, in the
developer's opinion, strict compliance with the provisions of these
regulations is unnecessary. Any applicant or permit holder shall have
the right to appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction from any
decisions of the governing body.
§ 140-15 SHALER CODE § 140-18
1:362
§ 140-18. Liability.
Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this chapter nor the
compliance with the provisions hereto or with any condition imposed by the
administrator hereunder shall relieve any person from any responsibility for
damage to persons or property resulting therefrom or as otherwise imposed
by law, nor impose any liability upon the Township for damages to persons
or property.
§ 140-19. Schedule of fees.
A fee in the amount of $5 per acre or each portion thereof will be charged
for each grading permit.
§ 140-20. Notice to cease violation.
Upon written notice of any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter
being served by the administrator on any person, such violation shall be
discontinued in accordance with said notice. If violation is not discontinued,
the administrator shall revoke the grading permit, and the violator shall be
subject to fine.
§ 140-21. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 plus the costs
of proceedings for each offense, the same to be collected in the name of
the Township of Shaler by summary proceeding, and, in default of payment
of the fine and costs, such person shall be committed to the Allegheny
County Jail for a period not to exceed 90 days. The continuance of any
violation of this chapter for each period of 24 hours after notice of the same
by the administrator shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense for
each twenty-four-hour period. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
preclude the Township of Shaler to seek other relief or avail itself of any
remedy that may be at law or in equity to prevent continuing violation of the
terms of this chapter or to restrain or abate such violation.

The purpose of this chapter is to require the clear display of authorized
and assigned house or building numbers on every building fronting on
any street in the Township of Shaler in order to assist the general public
and emergency services, public and private, in identifying any building
in case of emergency or otherwise. It is also the purpose of this chapter
to eliminate duplicate, nonsequential and conflicting house and building
numbers so that emergency vehicles are not dispatched to an erroneous
address. Finally, it is the intent of this chapter to require that each
telephone physically located in Shaler Township, irrespective of the billing
address of the telephone, be assigned an identification and location number
for emergency purposes.
§ 143-4. Applicability.
All residential, commercial and industrial buildings erected or to be erected
within the Township of Shaler shall display identification numbers as
provided herein and in accordance with this chapter. Moreover, each
telephone physically located in Shaler Township, and irrespective of the
billing address of the telephone, shall be assigned an identification and
location number for emergency purposes.
§ 143-5. Determination and assignment of house and building
numbers.
House and building numbers shall be determined and assigned by the
Township of Shaler Building Inspector. If on the effective date of this
chapter a structure exists in Shaler Township which requires a house or
building number, and a number has not yet been assigned to such structure,
the Township Building Inspector shall notify the owner of the structure
when a house or building number is assigned to such structure. Moreover,
the Building Inspector shall assign an identification and location number
to each telephone physically located in Shaler Township. Identification and
location numbers assigned by the Building Inspector to telephones may be
identical to the house and building number assigned to the structure in
which the telephone is located.
§ 143-6. Duplicate, nonsequential or conflicting identification
numbers.
It shall also be the duty of the Township Building Inspector to ascertain
if any duplicate, nonsequential or conflicting street identification numbers
exist in the Township of Shaler. If the Township Building Inspector
determines that a duplicate, nonsequential or conflicting street
§ 143-2 SHALER CODE § 143-6
1:364
identification number exists, it shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to
assign or reassign a different street identification number to such structure;
to require that such new street identification number be used to identify
such property; and to promptly notify the owner of the affected structure
that a new house or building number has been assigned to such structure.
In assigning or reassigning a new house or building number pursuant to
this section, the Building Inspector shall make all new assignments and
reassignments of street identification numbers as shall be necessary to
promote public safety.
§ 143-7. Appeals of reassignment of street identification numbers.
Any person aggrieved by the reassignment of a street identification number
may appeal the determination of the Township Building Inspector to the
Township Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days after notice of the decision
by the Township Building Inspector and not thereafter.
§ 143-8. Placement of street identification numbers.
The owner, occupant or lessee of every house and building in Shaler
Township which now or hereafter fronts on any public or private street,
and who has been assigned or reassigned a house number either prior or
subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, shall, at his or her own
expense and within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter or notice
of such assignment or reassignment, cause the authorized and assigned or
reassigned number of such structure to be permanently and conspicuously
placed in accordance with the specifications set forth herein. Any owner
who has not been assigned a number prior to the effective date of this
chapter shall, within 30 days after notice of assignment of such number,
comply with all requirements of this chapter.
§ 143-9. Specifications.
House or building numbers shall be:
A. In Arabic numerals;
B. A minimum height of three inches for residential properties, a minimum
height of six inches for commercial and industrial properties, and a
minimum height of six inches for garden apartments and townhouse
condominium complexes;
C. Mounted in a secure fashion to the front wall or porch of the building so
as to be clearly visible from the street;
D. Sufficiently legible in contrasting background, arrangement, spacing

time period specified above, the application shall be deemed approved.
In each case, the Township shall review the application to determine

relates to the rights-of-way or would place an undue physical burden on
the rights-of-way.
C. In considering an application, the Township may use such outside
experts as it deems necessary. In the event that the Township deems it
necessary to employ an outside expert or experts to advise the

permit holder shall have 30 days to cure the violation, unless the
Township reasonably determines that the event is an emergency, in
which case the Township may impose a shorter time period to cure the
violation.
C. If the permit holder fails to cure the violation within the specified time
period, the Township shall be permitted to immediately suspend the
right-of-way permit. A suspension shall be brought to the attention of
the Board of Commissioners at its next meeting, at which time the
Board shall be permitted to uphold or withdraw the suspension. The
permit holder shall be provided an opportunity to be heard at such
meeting.

deny the construction permit within such time period, the permit shall
be deemed granted. In each such case, the Township shall review the
information provided herein to determine whether such construction
would have a detrimental impact on public safety as it relates to the

permit holder. Such costs in managing the rights-of-way include, but
are not limited to, inspection costs, administrative costs, costs of
maintaining the rights-of-way and costs of degradation of streets and
right-of-way property. This fee will not be refunded in the event that the
application is denied. If the application is granted, the application fee
will apply to the full term of the right-of-way permit of one year. If the
applicant applies for a construction permit concurrently with the
application for a right-of-way permit, then the application fee contained

costs of maintaining the rights-of-way and costs of degradation of
streets and right-of-way property.
C. Each applicant for a construction permit shall include with its
application an application fee in the amount of $200. This fee is directly
related to the Township's costs in reviewing the application and
determining time, place and manner restrictions on the construction
activity. If the application for a construction permit is denied, this fee
shall not be refunded. If the application is granted, then the applicant
shall pay, within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, the
Township's actual costs based on the hourly rate established by
resolution of the Board of Commissioners. Such actual costs include,

upon submission of the application or by the date due, the applicant or
permit holder shall pay a late payment penalty of simple interest at 10%
annual percentage rate of the total amount past due. Such penalty shall
be in lieu of any other monetary penalty. Acceptance of payment under

General Provisions
§ 190-1. Statement of findings.
The Board of Commissioners of the Township of Shaler finds that:
§ 190-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the Township as well as to protect, sustain and
enhance the surface water and groundwater resources of the Township.
Drainage and stormwater management practices shall be utilized as
directed herein to achieve the following goals and objectives:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to
the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the people of the
Township and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources, and
the environment.
A. Accommodate site development and redevelopment in a manner that
protects public safety and which is consistent with (or reestablishes)
the natural hydrologic characteristics of each watershed and sustains
groundwater recharge, stream base flows, stable stream channel
(geomorphology) conditions, the carrying capacity of streams and their
floodplains, groundwater and surface water quality, and aquatic living
resources and their habitats.
B. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated.
C. Protect natural infiltration and groundwater recharge rates in order to
sustain groundwater supplies and stream base flows.
D. Maintain runoff characteristics of the site after completion of
development that are consistent with the carrying capacity and stable
channel conditions of the receiving streams.
E. Protect water quality by removing and/or treating pollutants prior to
discharge to groundwaters and surface waters throughout the
Township and to protect, restore and maintain the chemical, physical
and biological quality of groundwaters and surface waters.
§ 190-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-2
1:509
§ 190-3. Statutory authority.
F. Protect in-stream channels and geomorphology conditions of the
receiving streams, protect their flood-carrying capacity and aquatic
habitats and to reduce in-stream erosion and sedimentation.
G. Reduce flooding impacts and prevent a significant increase in surface
runoff rates and volumes, predevelopment to post development, which
could worsen flooding downstream in the watershed, enlarge
floodplains, erode stream banks and create other flood-related, healthwelfare-
property losses; in general, to preserve and restore the natural
flood-carrying capacity of streams and their floodplains.
H. Protect adjacent lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater
discharges.
I. Ensure effective long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities.
J. Maintain natural drainage patterns and encourage the use of natural
drainage systems.
K. Treat and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as
possible using a minimum of structures and maximizing reliance on
natural processes.
L. Maintain the existing water balance in all watersheds, subwatersheds
and streams in the Township, and protect and/or restore natural
hydrologic characteristics and habitats wherever possible throughout
the watershed systems.
M. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
N. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed sites undergoing
redevelopment while encouraging development and redevelopment in
urban areas and areas designated for growth.
O. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
P. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code § 93.4a, to protect and maintain existing
uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
A. Primary authority. The Township is empowered to regulate these
activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act

be approved by the Township if enforcement will exact undue
hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions
peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications will
not be contrary or detrimental to the public interest and will
achieve the intended outcome and that the purpose of the chapter
is preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical
circumstances or conditions and not to circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of the Stormwater
Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden shall not be
considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property. A request for modifications shall be in writing
and accompany the stormwater management site plan submission.
(10)No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may
be granted by the Township. Townships are responsible for
reviewing proposed waivers/modifications. The waiver must come
from the landowner and be presented in writing along with a
stormwater management site plan. The designated plan reviewer
§ 190-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-6
1:515
§ 190-7. General requirements.
shall determine if the plan meets the requirement of the chapter.
If the proposed disturbance is one acre or greater, it must be
approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or
the delegated county conservation district.
A. The management of stormwater on site, both during and upon

under § 190-4, shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards
and criteria of this chapter. The design of any temporary or permanent
facilities and structures and the utilization of any natural drainage
systems shall be in full compliance with this chapter. The intent of these
design standards is to encourage environmentally sound stormwater
management practices that provide necessary drainage facilities while
protecting the hydrologic characteristics and water quality of the site
and watershed. Developments shall be required to incorporate
stormwater management controls. Stormwater management design
shall blend into the natural environment and be aesthetically integrated
into the site design.
B. Applicants shall refer to the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual, as amended; Pennsylvania Handbook of
Best Management Practices for Developing Areas (PACD, 1998); the
2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual (MDE, 2000); or other
appropriate references for guidance in the design of stormwater
management facilities most appropriate to individual site conditions.
Objectives for design are to reduce the volume of stormwater
generated, infiltrate runoff at its source to the maximum extent
possible, achieve water quality improvement at the source or during
conveyance, and provide for peak flow attenuation; applicants shall
examine design alternatives by viewing them in a series. In addition,
applicants are strongly encouraged to use structural and nonstructural
stormwater management practices that reduce or eliminate the need
for detention basins.

Zoning Ordinance) and Chapter 130 of the Township Code (relating to
floodplain management) and this chapter. All development shall be
designed to maintain the flood-carrying capacity of the floodway such
that the base flood elevations are not increased, either upstream or
downstream, unless an approval is received from PADEP. The natural
conveyance characteristics of the site and the receiving floodplain shall
§ 190-6 SHALER CODE § 190-7
1:516
be incorporated into the stormwater management practices proposed
for the site.
E. The stormwater management system shall not create an adverse impact
on stormwater quantity or quality in either upstream or downstream
areas. Off-site areas which discharge to or across a site proposed for
development shall be addressed in the stormwater management plan
prepared for the development. No stormwater management plan shall
be approved until it is demonstrated that the runoff from the project
shall not adversely impact downstream areas.
F. Wetlands shall not be used to meet the minimum design requirements
for stormwater management or stormwater runoff quality treatment,
except when used as part of a treatment train that incorporates a
portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the wetland's riparian buffer as
a stormwater outfall.
G. All proposed stormwater management systems shall be designed to
prevent the pollution of groundwater resources by stormwater, promote
safety, minimize health hazards, preserve natural features and provide
infiltration and groundwater recharge where appropriate. Neither
submission of a plan under the provisions herein nor compliance with
the provisions of these regulations shall relieve any person from
responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed
by law.
H. Where deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer or as addressed in
an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan, the applicant shall:
(1) Construct storm drains to handle on-site runoff;

Planning Code and Act 167, or any amendments thereto, provide
on-site/off-site drainage easements; and
(3) Provide for the conveyance of off-site runoff to an acceptable outlet
in the same watershed.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easements shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures, except as needed for roadways, driveways and walkways, or
any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within
any portions of the easement, and require the establishment and
protection of riparian buffers.
J. For all regulated activities, stormwater management BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under
Pennsylvania Code Title 25, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm
Water Management Act.
§ 190-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-7
1:517
K. Any regulated activity that may affect the stormwater flows toward or
onto a state or county highway right-of-way or facility shall be designed,
implemented, operated and maintained in accordance with the
regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) or Allegheny County, as the case may be.
L. At the time of application for a building permit for any approved lot
created by a subdivision and/or improved as a land development
project, issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon adherence to
the terms of this chapter.
M. Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g.,
special protection waters, cold-water fisheries, recharge areas, water
supply reservoirs, etc.) may be subject to additional performance
criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices.
N. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated and maintained
during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g., during
construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter
and to meet all requirements under the Pennsylvania Code Title 25 and
the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design standards are
listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual
(E&S Manual), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of

groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter, nonstructural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.

which converges and flows primarily through water conveyance features,
such as swales, gullies, waterways, channels or storm sewers and which
exceeds the maximum specified flow rates of filters or perimeter controls
intended to control sheet flow.
CONSERVATION DESIGN  A series of holistic land development design
practices that maximize protection of key land and environmental
resources, preserve significant concentrations of open space and
greenways, evaluate and maintain site hydrology, and ensure flexibility
in development design to meet community needs for complementary and
aesthetically pleasing development. Conservation design encompasses the
following objectives: conservation/enhancement of natural resources,
§ 190-12 SHALER CODE § 190-12
1:524

space); minimization of environmental impact resulting from a change in
land use (minimum disturbance, minimum maintenance); maintenance of a
balanced water budget by making use of site characteristics and infiltration;
incorporation of unique natural, scenic and historic site features into the
configuration of the development; preservation of the integral
characteristics of the site as viewed from adjoining roads; and reduction
in maintenance required for stormwater management practices. Such
objectives can be met on a site through an integrated development process
that respects natural site conditions and attempts, to the maximum extent
possible, to replicate or improve the natural hydrology of a site.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  A conservation district, as defined in Section
3(c) of the Conservation District Law [3 P.S. § 851(c)], which has the

evaluation of stormwater management systems.
DETENTION BASIN  An impoundment designed to collect and retard
stormwater runoff by temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at
a predetermined rate. Detention basins are designed to drain completely,
shortly after any given rainfall event, and are dry until the next rainfall
event.

DISCHARGE  To release water from a project, site, aquifer, drainage basin
or other point of interest (verb); the rate and volume of flow of water, such
as in a stream, generally expressed in cubic feet per second (volume per
unit of time) (noun).
DISTURBED AREA  An unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance
is occurring or has occurred.
DITCH  An artificial waterway for irrigation or stormwater conveyance.
DRAINAGE AREA  That land area contributing runoff to a single point and
that is enclosed by a ridgeline.

minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged
wetting. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United
States Department of Agriculture defines the four groups and provides a list
of most of the soils in the United States and their group classification. The
soils in the area of the development site may be identified from a soil survey
report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district
offices. Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D.

water. It includes semipervious surfaces, such as compacted clayey soils,
as well as most conventionally surfaced streets, roofs, sidewalks, parking
lots, and other similar surfaces. Net increase of impervious surface refers
to the difference between the existing impervious coverage and the total
impervious surface proposed.

the direction of slope and extending across the width of the slope for the
purpose of intercepting surface runoff and spreading it behind the berm
to enhance infiltration and reduce erosion and runoff from the slope. The
purpose of a level spreader is to prevent concentrated, erosive flows from
occurring and to spread out stormwater runoff uniformly over the ground
as sheet flow.
LOADING  The total amount (generally measured in pounds or kilograms
per acre per year) of material (sediment, nutrients, oxygen-demanding
material, or other chemicals or compounds) brought into a lake, stream or

over a specific period of time (often annually).
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and smallscale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural
systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can
be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects.
LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store
runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance
and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of
small, cost-effective landscape features located on site.
MAINTENANCE  The action taken to restore or preserve the as-built
functional design of any facility or system.

ARTICLE IV
Permanent Stormwater Management Design Standards
§ 190-14. Design goals, principles and standards.
A. Design goals. Applicants shall adhere to a holistic design process
incorporating the goals listed below. The objective is to achieve postdevelopment
hydrologic conditions that are consistent with the
predevelopment ground cover assumption for new development (refer
to § 190-15B) and improve the runoff conditions for redevelopment
[refer to § 190-14C(3)]. The design goals are:
(1) Minimize the volume of runoff that must be collected, conveyed,
treated and released by stormwater management facilities;
(2) Maintain the natural infiltration process and rate, and infiltrate
runoff at its source when appropriate;
(3) Remove and/or treat pollutants at the source or during conveyance;
(4) Provide for peak flow attenuation, as needed; and
(5) Attenuate runoff to protect the in-stream channel of the receiving
stream.
B. General principles. The following general principles shall apply to all
applicable activities pursuant to § 190-4:
(1) Incorporate conservation design practices to minimize the amount
of stormwater generated on a site, encourage the disconnection of
impervious land cover, and maximize the use of pervious areas for
stormwater treatment and on-site rainfall infiltration.
(2) Infiltration of surface water runoff at its source is to be a
mechanism for stormwater management based on hydrologic soil
group (or infiltration testing). Infiltration practices include, but are
not limited to, those referenced in § 190-16B(1) and as outlined in
the publications listed in § 190-16. Infiltration practices shall
adhere to the following criteria:
(a) In choosing methods of infiltration, preference shall be given to
a combination of surface and subsurface infiltration methods.
(b) Applicants shall first consider minimum disturbance/minimum
maintenance techniques combined with site grading that
distributes runoff to reduce concentration. Next, applicants
shall consider depression areas combined with subsurface
infiltration practices followed by other subsurface measures,
including, but not limited to, porous paving and perforated
pipe storage.
(c) The use of multiple infiltration features and facilities that
provide for the following is encouraged:
§ 190-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-14
1:539
[1] Discourage concentration of flows;
[2] Encourage disconnection of flows;
[3] Infiltrate as close to the source of runoff as possible; and
[4] Reduce visual impact.
(d) Where high-water tables, subsurface contamination, slope
stability concerns, or other site constraints preclude achieving
the required infiltration volume, additional conservation
design practices and alternative stormwater management
practices shall be implemented to reduce, to the maximum
extent practicable, the total volume of stormwater released to
streams. The applicant shall follow the stormwater runoff
hierarchy of § 190-16A(1).
(e) Infiltration areas shall be designed to maintain any broad and
even infiltration pattern which existed prior to development.
Such facilities shall use the natural topography and vegetation
in order to blend in with the site. Infiltration designs which do
not provide this may be used if the applicant demonstrates to
the Township's satisfaction that alternative approaches would
be more effective, more harmonious with their existing
environment and as easily maintained.
(f) Aboveground stormwater infiltration facilities shall be as
shallow as possible while still achieving the requirements of
this chapter.
(3) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with or
as part of infiltration practices. Water quality improvements shall
also be provided for drainage areas not otherwise addressed by
infiltration practices either at the source of runoff and/or during
conveyance away from the source of runoff.
(4) To reduce the need for large retention and/or detention basins
designed to satisfy the peak flow attenuation and extended
detention requirements, other innovative stormwater management
practices located close to the source of runoff generation shall be
considered, including a combination of practices (e.g., rooftop
storage, open vegetated channels, bioretention, pervious pavement
systems and infiltration trenches).
(5) When designing stormwater management facilities to satisfy the
peak flow attenuation and extended detention requirements [refer
to § 190-14C(2)(b)], the effect of structural and nonstructural
stormwater management practices implemented as part of the
overall site design may be taken into consideration when
calculating total storage volume and release rates.
§ 190-14 SHALER CODE § 190-14
1:540
(6) Site hydrology and natural infiltration patterns shall guide site
design, construction and vegetation decisions. All channels,
drainageways, swales, natural streams and other surface water
concentrations shall be considered and, where possible,
incorporated into design decisions.
(7) A justification, acceptable to the Township Official or Township
Engineer, must be included in the SWM site plan if BMPs other
than green infrastructure methods and LID practices are proposed
to achieve the volume, rate and water quality controls under this
chapter.
C. Minimum performance criteria.
(1) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable activities, whether they are new development or
redevelopment, pursuant to § 190-4A:
(a) Water quality treatment of stormwater runoff shall be provided
for all discharges prior to release to a receiving water body. If a
stormwater management practice does not provide water
quality treatment, then water quality best management
practices shall be utilized prior to the runoff entering the
stormwater management practice.
(b) Water quality management shall be provided through the use
of structural and/or nonstructural stormwater management
practices. Water quality stormwater management practices
shall be designed to reduce or eliminate solids, sediment,
nutrients, and other potential pollutants from the site. It is
presumed that a stormwater management practice complies
with this requirement if it is:
[1] Designed according to the specific performance criteria
outlined in § 190-7B;
[2] Constructed in accordance with all permits and approved
plans and specifications; and
[3] Maintained pursuant to an approved operation and
maintenance plan or agreement or, in lieu of that, in
accordance with customary practices.
(c) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential for pollutant loadings (hot spots) may require the use
of specific structural stormwater management practices and
pollution prevention practices. In addition, stormwater from a
hot spot land use shall be provided with proper pretreatment
prior to infiltration. For the purpose of this chapter, the sites/
facilities listed in § 190-14C(1)(d) below are considered hot
spots.
§ 190-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-14
1:541
(d) Certain industrial sites may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file
notice of intent as required under the provision of the EPA
industrial stormwater NPDES permit requirements. Other
industrial sites storing significant quantities of chemicals/
wastes shall also prepare a prevention plan. Sites that are
required by EPA to prepare a plan include, but are not limited
to:
[1] Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities;
[2] Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities;
[3] Fleet storage areas for buses, trucks etc.;
[4] Marinas (service and maintenance); or
[5] Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(e) Conveyance structures/channels shall be designed and
adequately sized so as to protect the properties receiving
runoff from impacts of flooding and erosion. Where necessary,
and to the maximum extent permitted under the Municipalities
Planning Code116 and Act 167, or any amendments thereto, a
drainage easement from adjoining properties shall be obtained
to ensure the integrity of the drainageway and the protection
of adjoining properties and shall also establish the operation
and maintenance requirements for the drainageway.
(f) All stormwater management practices shall have an operation
and maintenance plan, pursuant to § 190-21 of this chapter,
and if to be privately owned, an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement, pursuant to § 190-22 of this chapter,
to ensure the system functions as designed and to provide
remedies for system failure.
(g) Stormwater runoff generated from development and
discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of
the United States and their adjacent wetlands shall be treated
by an approved stormwater management practice prior to
release into a natural wetlands and shall not be used to meet
the minimum design requirements for stormwater
management or stormwater runoff quality treatment, except
when used as part of a treatment train that incorporates a
portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the wetland's riparian
buffer as a stormwater outfall. In such instances, the discharge
velocity from the terminal end of a pipe or associated energy
dissipation practice shall not exceed two feet per second for
the two-year-frequency storm event. Where such a
management strategy is used, all feasible methods shall be

§ 190-14 SHALER CODE § 190-14
1:542
used to convert concentrated flow to uniform, shallow sheet
flow before entering the outer zone of the wetland's riparian
buffer. In addition, it shall be demonstrated that such an
approach will not cause erosion.
(2) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable new development activities pursuant to § 190-4A.
(a) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction
with or as part of infiltration practices (if used). Water quality
improvements shall also be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff
generated by the one-inch rainfall event. Refer to § 190-16A(2)
for water quality volume design standards and assumptions.
Stormwater quality management practice selection, design
and implementation shall be based upon appropriate reference
materials, as provided in § 190-7B.
(b) The post-development peak discharge rate shall not exceed the
predevelopment peak discharge rate multiplied by the
subbasin release rate percentage (where determined in Act
167 watersheds) for the two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year
and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm events pursuant
to the predevelopment cover assumption described in
§ 190-15B. Refer to Appendix A for release rate percentages
information.117
(c) Facilities capable of attenuating rainfall runoff shall be
provided and be designed to attenuate the runoff volume from
the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event for at least 24
hours.
(d) Stormwater shall be infiltrated and/or discharged within the
same drainage area of the stream receiving the runoff from the
development site prior to development.
(e) Structural and nonstructural stormwater management
practices that make best possible use of infiltration on site
shall be considered in all site designs, when appropriate.
(3) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable redevelopment activities, pursuant to § 190-4B:
(a) One of the following minimum performance standards shall be
accomplished. Selection of the performance standard shall be
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions:

§ 190-15. Stormwater runoff calculation criteria.
In addition to the infiltration and water quality requirements of this chapter,
peak flow from those activities resulting in increases in impervious surface
and/or regrading and compaction shall be attenuated consistent with the
following stormwater calculation methods:
[1] Reduce the total impervious cover on the site (e.g., by
using pervious pavement, replacement of pavement with
pervious planting areas or green roof systems) by at least
25%, based on a comparison of existing impervious cover
to proposed impervious cover; or
[2] Provide facilities designed to attenuate the runoff volume
from the one-year twenty-four-hour post-development
storm event for at least 24 hours; or
[3] Provide facilities to ensure that the post-development peak
discharge rate shall not exceed the predevelopment peak
discharge rate multiplied by the subbasin release rate
percentage (where determined in Act 167 watersheds) for
the two-year and ten-year twenty-four-hour storm events.
A predevelopment cover CN of 71 shall be assumed.
(b) In addition to the minimum performance standards for
redevelopment areas in § 190-14C(3) above, water quality
improvements shall be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management facilities
shall be designed to capture and treat 0.25 inch of runoff from
all pavement areas (i.e., parking lots, pavements and
noncovered sidewalks). Roof area may be excluded from this
calculation.

NOTES: The precipitation values for each frequency storm listed above
were abstracted from the precipitation frequency estimates developed
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as set forth
in NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 (NOAA, June 2004). The NOAA data is
available from the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center of the
National Weather Service.
B. The following assumptions shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For new development sites, the ground cover used as the
predevelopment assumption for runoff calculations shall be as
follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of woodland in good
condition. Portions of a site having more than one viable tree of
a DBH (diameter at breast height; DBH is the diameter of the
tree stem 4 1/2 feet above the ground) of six inches or greater
per 1,500 square feet shall be considered wooded where such
trees existed within 10 years of application. If there is evidence
of logging within the ten-year period, the logged area shall be
considered as woodland in good condition.
(b) Agricultural sites shall use a ground cover of pasture in good
condition.
(c) All other portions of a site shall use a ground cover of meadow
in good condition.
(d) All watershed areas contributing to the point of interest,
including off-site area, shall be considered.
(e) For redevelopment sites, see § 190-14C(3).
(2) The runoff curve numbers listed in the table below shall be used in
developing the runoff calculations for the ground covers noted in
§ 190-15B(1). These values are referenced from the Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds Technical Release No. 55 (USDA,
1986). Coefficients for equivalent ground cover conditions shall be
used if a runoff method other than the Soil-Cover-Complex Method
is used.

TR-20).
(6) A Type II distribution storm (for the Soil-Cover-Complex Method
only, for example, TR-55, TR-20).
(7) For time of concentration calculations, sheet flow lengths shall not
exceed 100 feet and shallow concentrated flow lengths shall not
exceed 1,000 feet.
(8) The kinematic "n" value in the sheet flow equation shall be applied
as per the following table. (Values taken from TR-55.)

C. In all plans and designs for stormwater management systems and
facilities submitted to the Municipal Engineer for approval, stormwater
peak discharge and runoff shall be determined through the use of the
NRCS Soil-Cover-Complex Method, as set forth in Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (USDA, 1986), with
specific attention given to antecedent moisture conditions, flood
routing, time of concentration, and peak discharge specifications
included therein and in Hydrology National Engineering Handbook,
Section 4 (USDA, 1985), both by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Note that when
TR-55 is used for natural system-based approaches and practices
encouraged herein, calculations must be performed on a detailed small
subarea basis. Use of Technical Release No. 20 and other methods
listed in Table 1 is also acceptable. The design professional's selection
of a specific method shall be based on the suitability of the method for
the given project site conditions with due consideration to the
limitations of the method chosen. Table 1 herein summarizes the
computational methods available.

D. A modified Rational Method analysis may be used for drainage areas
smaller than two acres when permitted by the Municipal Engineer. The
term "modified Rational Method" used herein refers to a procedure for
manipulation of the basic Rational Method techniques to reflect the fact
that storms with a duration greater than the normal time of
concentration for a basin will result in a larger volume of runoff even
though the peak discharge is reduced. The methodology and model
chosen for use shall be well documented as being appropriate for use in
this region, and all relevant assumptions, methodologies, calculations
and data used shall be provided to the Municipal Engineer for review.
Information on the modified Rational Method is presented in the
Recommended Hydrologic Procedures for Computing Urban Runoff
from Small Watersheds in Pennsylvania (PADEP, 1982).
E. Rainfall intensities used for the modified Rational Method shall be
based on the precipitation frequency estimates developed by the
§ 190-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-15
1:547
§ 190-16. Standards for stormwater management practices.
The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual shall
serve as a guide for the design of stormwater management practices.
Additional design guidance may also be obtained from other related
sources, including the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual, Volumes
I and II (MDE, 2000), Design of Stormwater Filtering Systems (CWP, 1996),
and the American Society of Civil Engineers Manual and Report on
Engineering Practice, No. 87, Urban Runoff Quality Management (ASCE,
1998), for the design of stormwater runoff quality control features for site
development. The water quality volume design measures used herein are
based partially on the methodology expressed in the Maryland manual
referenced above. Pursuant to the design options recommended in the
above documents, the following standards shall be adhered to:
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as set forth in NOAA
Atlas 14.
F. The Rational Method (that is, Q = CIA) shall be used for calculations of
the peak rate of runoff for the design of storm sewers and drainage
swales but not for the design of stormwater management facilities
where a full hydrograph is needed. The equation representing the
Rational Method is comprised of the following (in English units):
Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (cfs).
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover.
I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour.
A = Drainage area, acres.
G. Runoff characteristics of off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development shall be considered and be based on the existing
conditions in the off-site area.
A. Extended detention, water quality volume, infiltration and
nonstructural BMP credits criteria. The following sizing criteria shall be
followed at all sites required to meet the standards of this chapter:
(1) Extended detention.
(a) The one-year twenty-four-hour design storm shall be detained
using the SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made so
that the one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain
from the facility from a point where the maximum volume of
water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of
water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the
water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design
of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of
clogging and sedimentation potential.
§ 190-15 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:548
(b) Detention ponds shall detain the one-year storm event and
allow it to naturally infiltrate and recharge the groundwater
table. All subsequent orifices for the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and
one-hundred-year storm events shall be placed above the
maximum water surface elevation of the one-year storm.
(c) Flow from off-site areas must be considered as pass-through
flow if it is conveyed through the BMP and shall be modeled as
"present condition" for the one-year storm event.
(d) Normally dry, open top, storage facilities should completely
drain both the volume control and rate control capacities over
a period of time not less than 24 and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the design storm.
(e) The length of overland flow used in time of concentration (tc)
calculations is limited to no more than 100 feet for postdevelopment
conditions.
(f) The models TR-55 and TR-20 (or approved equivalent) may be
used for determining peak discharge rates.
(2) Water quality volume.
(a) Treatment of the water quality volume (WQv) of stormwater
prior to its release to receiving waters or water bodies shall be
provided at all developments where stormwater management
is required. The WQv equals the storage volume needed to
capture and treat the runoff from storms of one inch or less.
Runoff from the first one inch of rainfall transports most of the
total pollutant load. The WQv is based on the following
equation:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12 (acre-feet)
Where
P = Rainfall depth in inches (set to 1 inch).
Rv = Volumetric runoff coefficient, 0.05 + 0.009(I),
where I is percent impervious cover.
A = Site area (acres).
(b) The formula assumes approximately 5% runoff from pervious
surfaces and 90% runoff from impervious surfaces. A minimum
of 0.2 inch per acre of runoff volume shall be met at sites or in
drainage areas that have less than 15% impervious cover.
(c) Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the
WQv calculations. However, designers are encouraged to
incorporate water quality treatment practices for these areas.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:549
(d) Stormwater quality treatment. The final WQv shall be treated
by an acceptable stormwater management practice from those
described in this section or as approved by the Township.
(e) For new developments and redevelopments, infiltration is
considered an acceptable method of satisfying part or all of the
water quality volume.
(f) For new developments, the WQv requirements of this section
shall be sized and designed in conjunction with the standards
under § 190-16A(1).
(g) As a basis for design, the following assumptions may be made:
[1] Multiple drainage areas. When a project contains or is
divided by multiple drainage areas, the WQv volume shall
be addressed for each drainage area.
[2] Off-site drainage areas. The WQv shall be based on the
impervious cover of the proposed site. Off-site existing
impervious areas may be excluded from the calculation of
the water quality volume requirements.
(3) Infiltration volume. Where possible, all of the water quality volume
shall be treated using infiltration BMPs. The following calculation
shall be used to determine the minimum recharge goal for the site:
Recharge volume (Rev), (acre-feet)
Fraction of WQv, depending on soil hydrologic group
Rev = (S)(A1)
Where
S = Soil-specific recharge factor in inches.
A1 = The measured impervious cover.
Hydrologic Soil Group
Soil-Specific Recharge Factor
(S)
(inches of runoff)
A 0.40
B 0.25
C 0.10
D 0.05
(a) Infiltrated volume may be subtracted from the total site WQv.
(b) Infiltration shall not be considered for sites or areas of sites
that have activities that may allow pollution to be infiltrated.
For example, the use of infiltration for the runoff of a service
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:550
station's paved lot would not be appropriate, although roof
water from the service station may be infiltrated.
(c) Infiltration shall only be used when, in the opinion of a
professional engineer, it will not contribute to slope instability
or cause seepage problems into basements or developed
downgradient areas.
(d) If more than one hydrologic soil group is present at a site, a
composite recharge volume shall be computed based upon the
proportion of total site area within each hydrologic soil group.
(e) All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 15 feet from
all structures with subgrade elements (e.g., basements,
foundation walls).
(4) Credits for use of nonstructural BMPs. The developer may obtain
credits for the use of nonstructural BMPs using the procedures
outlined below. Examples of nonstructural credit calculations are
provided in Appendix E.118
(a) Volume reduction method No. 1: natural area conservation. A
water quality volume reduction may be taken when
undisturbed natural areas are conserved on a site, thereby
retaining their predevelopment hydrologic and water quality
characteristics. Under this method, a designer would be able
to subtract the conservation areas from the total site area
when computing the water quality protection volume. An
added benefit is that the post-development peak discharges
will be smaller, and hence, water quantity control volumes will
be reduced due to lower post-development curve numbers or
rational formula "C" values.
[1] Rule: Subtract conservation areas from total site area
when computing water quality protection volume
requirements.
[2] Criteria.
[a] The conservation area cannot be disturbed during
project construction and must be protected from
sediment deposition. The conservation area shall be
protected with a safety fence until construction has
been completed. After construction, the area shall be
posted with signage indicating that it is a conservation
area.
[b] The conservation area shall be protected by limits of
disturbance clearly shown on all construction
drawings.
118. Editor's Note: Appendix E is on file in the Township offices.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:551
[c] The conservation area shall be located within an
acceptable conservation easement instrument that
ensures perpetual protection of the proposed area.
The easement must clearly specify how the natural
area vegetation shall be managed and boundaries will
be marked. [Note: Managed turf (e.g., playgrounds,
regularly maintained open areas) is not an acceptable
form of vegetation management.]
[d] The conservation area shall have a minimum
contiguous area requirement of 10,000 square feet.
[e] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
[f] The conservation area must be forested or have a
stable, natural ground cover.
(b) Volume reduction method No. 2: stream buffers. This reduction
may be taken when a stream buffer effectively treats
stormwater runoff. Effective treatment constitutes treating
runoff through overland flow in a naturally vegetated or
forested buffer. Under the proposed method, a designer would
be able to subtract areas draining via overland flow to the
buffer from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements. The design of the stream
buffer treatment system shall use appropriate methods for
conveying flows above the annual recurrence (one-year storm)
event.
[1] Rule: Subtract areas draining via overland flow to the
buffer from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements.
[2] Criteria.
[a] The minimum undisturbed buffer width shall be 50
feet from top of bank.
[b] The maximum contributing length shall be 150 feet for
pervious surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces.
[c] The average contributing slope shall be 3% maximum
unless a flow spreader is used. In no case shall the
average contributing slope be greater than 10%.
[d] Runoff shall enter the buffer as overland sheet flow. A
flow spreader may be installed to ensure this.
[e] Buffers shall remain as naturally vegetated or forested
areas and shall require only routine debris removal or
erosion repairs.
[f] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:552
[g] Not applicable if overland flow filtration/groundwater
recharge reduction is already being taken.
(c) Volume reduction method No. 3: enhanced swales. This
reduction may be taken when enhanced swales are used for
water quality protection. Under the proposed method, a
designer would be able to subtract the areas draining to an
enhanced swale from total site area when computing water
quality protection volume requirements. An enhanced swale
can fully meet the water quality protection volume
requirements for certain kinds of low-density residential
development (see volume reduction method No. 5). An added
benefit is the post-development peak discharges will likely be
lower due to a longer time of concentration for the site.
[1] Rule: Subtract the areas draining to an enhanced swale
from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements.
[2] Criteria.
[a] This method is typically only applicable to moderateor
low-density residential land uses (three dwelling
units per acre maximum).
[b] The maximum flow velocity for water quality design
storm shall be less than or equal to 1.0 foot per
second.
[c] The minimum residence time for the water quality
storm shall be five minutes.
[d] The bottom width shall be a maximum of six feet. If a
larger channel is needed, use of a compound cross
section is required.
[e] The side slopes shall be 3:1 (horizontal:vertical) or
flatter.
[f] The channel slope shall be 3% or less.
[g] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
(d) Volume reduction method No. 4: overland flow filtration/
groundwater recharge. This reduction may be taken when
overland flow filtration/infiltration zones are incorporated into
the site design to receive runoff from rooftops or other small
impervious areas (e.g., driveways, small parking lots, etc.).
This can be achieved by grading the site to promote overland
vegetative filtering or by providing infiltration or rain garden
areas. If impervious areas are adequately disconnected, they
can be deducted from total site area when computing the water
quality protection volume requirements. An added benefit will
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:553
be that the post-development peak discharges will likely be
lower due to a longer time of concentration for the site.
[1] Rule: If impervious areas are adequately disconnected,
they may be deducted from total site area when computing
the water quality protection volume requirements.
[2] Criteria.
[a] Relatively permeable soils (hydrologic soil groups A
and B) shall be present.
[b] Runoff shall not come from a designated hot spot.
[c] The maximum contributing impervious flow path
length shall be 75 feet.
[d] Downspouts shall be at least 10 feet away from the
nearest impervious surface to discourage
reconnections.
[e] The disconnection shall drain continuously through a
vegetated channel, swale or filter strip to the property
line or structural stormwater control.
[f] The length of the disconnection shall be equal to or
greater than the contributing length.
[g] The entire vegetative disconnection shall be on a slope
less than or equal to 3%.
[h] The surface impervious area tributary to any one
discharge location shall not exceed 5,000 square feet.
[i] For those areas draining directly to a buffer, reduction
can be obtained from either overland flow filtration or
stream buffers (see method No. 2).
[j] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
(e) Volume reduction method No. 5: environmentally sensitive
large-lot subdivisions. This reduction may be taken when a
group of environmental site design techniques are applied to
low- and very-low-density residential development [e.g., one
dwelling unit per two acres (du/ac) or lower]. The use of this
method can eliminate the need for structural stormwater
controls to treat water quality protection volume
requirements. This method is targeted towards large lot
subdivisions and will likely have limited application.
[1] Rule: targeted towards large-lot subdivisions (e.g., twoacre
lots and greater). The requirement for structural
facilities to treat the water quality protection volume may
be waived.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:554
[2] Criteria.
[a] For single-lot development:
[i] Total site impervious cover is less than 15%.
[ii] Lot size shall be at least two acres.
[iii] Rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with
the criteria in method No. 4.
[iv] Grass channels are used to convey runoff versus
curb and gutter.
[b] For multiple lots:
[i] Total impervious cover footprint shall be less than
15% of the area.
[ii] Lot areas shall be at least two acres, unless
clustering is implemented. Open space
developments shall have a minimum of 25% of the
site protected as natural conservation areas and
shall be at least a half-acre average individual lot
size.
[iii] Grass channels shall be used to convey runoff
versus curb and gutter (see method No. 3).
[iv] Overland flow filtration/infiltration zones shall be
established (see method No. 4).
B. Stormwater infiltration/practices.
(1) In selecting the appropriate infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall
consider the following:
(a) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(b) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(c) Seasonal high-water table.
(d) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(e) Erodibility of soils.
(f) Land availability and topography.
(g) Slope stability.
(h) Effects on nearby properties and structures.
(2) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of infiltration BMPs. The evaluation shall
be performed by a qualified professional and, at a minimum,
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:555
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock and slope stability. The
general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the watershed to determine general
areas of suitability for infiltration BMPs.
(b) Provide field testing data to determine appropriate percolation
rate and/or hydraulic connectivity.
(c) Design infiltration BMPs for required stormwater volume
based on field-determined capacity at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface.
(3) Soil characteristics are subject to the following specific
considerations:
(a) Infiltration BMPs are particularly appropriate in hydrologic soil
groups A and B, as described in the Natural Resources
Conservation Manual TR-55.
(b) Low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) are preferred for the
construction of basins.
(c) There shall be a minimum depth of 48 inches between the
bottom of any facility and the seasonal high-water table and/or
bedrock (limiting zones), except for infiltration BMPs receiving
only roof runoff, which shall be placed in soils having a
minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the facility
and the limiting zone.
(d) There shall be an infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient
to accept the additional stormwater load and to drain
completely as determined by field tests.
(e) The infiltration system shall have positive overflow controls to
prevent storage within one foot of the finished surface or
grade.
(f) Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the storage
volume of the infiltration system.
(g) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge
of sediment into the infiltration system.
(4) The recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to the
most permeable hydrologic soil group available, except where
other considerations apply, such as in limestone geology.
(5) Any infiltration BMP shall be capable of completely infiltrating the
impounded water within 48 hours. The forty-eight-hour period is to
be measured from the end of the twenty-four-hour design storm.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:556
(6) The Township may require additional analyses for stormwater
management facilities proposed for susceptible areas, such as:
(a) Strip mines.
(b) Storage areas for salt, chloride, other materials for winter
deicing.
(c) Unstable slopes.
(7) During the period of land disturbance, runoff shall be controlled
prior to entering any proposed infiltration area. Areas proposed for
infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and
compaction during the construction phase, so as to maintain their
maximum infiltration capacity.
(8) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
(9) Infiltration facilities shall be selected based on suitability of soils
and site conditions. Acceptable infiltration facilities include, but
are not limited to, filter strips or stormwater filtering systems (for
example bioretention facilities, sand filters); open vegetated
channels (that is, dry swales and wet swales); infiltration trenches;
dry wells; infiltration basins; porous paving systems; retention
basins; wet extended detention ponds; riparian corridor
management; riparian forested buffers; rooftop runoff management
systems; and sand filters (closed or open).
(10) Where sediment transport in the stormwater runoff is anticipated
to reach the infiltration system, appropriate permanent measures
to prevent or collect sediment shall be installed prior to discharge
to the infiltration system.
(11) All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 15 feet from all
structures with subgrade elements (e.g., basements, foundation
walls).
(12) All infiltration facilities that serve more than one lot and are
considered a common facility shall have a drainage easement. The
easement shall provide to the Township the right of access and
shall be recorded in the Department of Real Estate of Allegheny
County, Pennsylvania.
(13) If a detailed infiltration study is required, the following rules shall
be followed:
(a) Soil evaluations shall be performed to determine the feasibility
and extent to which infiltration systems can be used. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified, licensed
geologist, geotechnical/civil engineer or soil scientist and, at a
minimum, address soil types, soil permeability, depth to
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:557
bedrock, limitations of soils, presence/absence of carbonate
geology susceptibility to subsidence and/or sinkhole formation
and subgrade stability. The testing and evaluation shall be
completed at the preliminary design stage.
(b) Infiltration requirements shall be based on the portions of the
site that are permeable prior to disturbance and the degree to
which development will reduce the permeability of the site.
Permeability of the site shall be determined based on the
detailed evaluations described herein. Use of stormwater
management facilities to retain stormwater for infiltration
shall be applied to all areas where the soils evaluation
indicates favorable conditions. Areas generally not favorable
for infiltration shall still be provided with an appropriate water
quality practice.
(c) Soil infiltration tests shall be performed to an equivalent depth
or elevation of the bottom of the proposed infiltration areas.
These tests shall follow the procedures of percolation test
holes as established by the Allegheny County Health
Department (ACHD) for on-lot septic systems. The testing shall
include a test pit and percolation test holes. The test hole shall
be excavated to a depth so that the presence or absence of
bedrock and/or seasonal high-water table can be determined. A
soil log describing the soils present in each test pit shall be
performed. All test holes used for evaluating the percolation
rate shall be presoaked in accordance with the procedures
established by the ACHD. The location and number of test pits
and percolation holes shall be determined based on the type(s)
of stormwater management facilities being designed.
Acceptability of infiltration rates shall be based on sound
engineering judgment and recommended design
considerations described in the design manuals listed in the
references or other source material acceptable to the
Municipal Engineer.
(14) The following design and construction standards shall be followed
when planning and constructing infiltration BMPs:
(a) The lowest elevation of the infiltration area shall be at least two
feet above the seasonal high-water table and bedrock.
(b) Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration
facilities, they shall have appropriate measures to prevent
clogging by unwanted debris (for example, silt, leaves and
vegetation). Such measures shall include, but are not limited
to, leaf traps, gutter guards and cleanouts.
(c) All infiltration facilities shall have appropriate positive
overflow controls to prevent storage within one foot of the
finished surface or grade, unless a specific amount of surface
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:558
storage away from pedestrian and vehicular traffic is provided
and such areas infiltrate the stored volume within 48 hours
after the end of the twenty-four-hour design storm.
(d) All infiltration facilities shall be designed to infiltrate the
stored volume within 48 hours after the end of the twenty-fourhour
design storm.
(e) All surface inflows shall be treated to prevent the direct
discharge of sediment into the infiltration practice;
accumulated sediment reduces stormwater storage capacity
and ultimately clogs the infiltration mechanism. No sand, salt
or other particulate matter may be applied to a porous
(pervious) surface for winter ice conditions.
(f) During site construction, all infiltration practice components
shall be protected from compaction due to heavy equipment
operation or storage of fill or construction material. Infiltration
areas shall also be protected from sedimentation. Areas that
are accidentally compacted or graded shall be remediated to
restore soil composition and porosity. Adequate documentation
to this effect shall be submitted for review by the Municipal
Engineer. All areas designated for infiltration shall not receive
runoff until the contributory drainage area has achieved final
stabilization.
(g) The following procedures and materials shall be required
during the construction of all subsurface facilities:
[1] Excavation for the infiltration facility shall be performed
with equipment that will not compact the bottom of the
seepage bed/trench or like facility.
[2] The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified
prior to the placement of aggregate.
[3] Only clean aggregate with documented porosity, free of
fines, shall be allowed.
[4] The tops and sides of all seepage beds, trenches or like
facilities shall be covered with drainage fabric. Fabric shall
meet the specifications of PennDOT Publication 408,
Section 735, Construction Class 1.
[5] Perforated distribution pipes connected to centralized
catch basins and/or manholes with the provision for the
collection of debris shall be provided in all facilities. Where
perforated pipes are used to distribute stormwater to the
infiltration practice, stormwater shall be distributed
uniformly throughout the entire seepage bed/trench or like
facility.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:559
C. Open vegetated channels.
(1) Open vegetated channels are conveyance systems that are
engineered to also perform as water quality and infiltration
facilities. Such systems can be used for the conveyance, retention,
infiltration and filtration of stormwater runoff.
(2) Open vegetated channels primarily serve a water quality function
(WQv). They also have the potential to augment infiltration.
Examples of such systems include, but are not limited to, dry
swales, wet swales, grass channels and biofilters. Open vegetated
channels are primarily applicable for land uses such as roads,
highways, residential developments (dry swales only) and pervious
areas.
(3) Open vegetated channels shall be designed to meet the following
minimum standards:
(a) The channel shall be designed to safely convey the ten-yearfrequency
storm event with a freeboard of at least 12 inches.
"Freeboard" is the difference between the elevation of the
design flow in the channel and the top elevation of the channel.
(b) The peak velocity of the runoff from the ten-year storm shall be
nonerosive for the soil and ground cover provided in the
channel.
(c) The longitudinal slope shall be no greater than 4%.
(d) Channels shall be trapezoidal in cross section.
(e) Channels shall be designed with moderate side slopes of four
horizontal to one vertical. Flatter side slopes may be necessary
under certain circumstances.
(f) The maximum allowable ponding time in the channel shall be
less than 48 hours.
(g) Channels (for example, dry swales) may require an underdrain
in order to function and dewater.
(h) Channels shall be designed to temporarily store the WQv
within the system for a maximum period of 48 hours and a
minimum period of one hour.
(i) Landscape specifications shall address the grass species,
wetland plantings (if applicable), soil amendment and hydric
conditions present along the channel.
(j) Accumulated sediment within the channel bottom shall be
removed when 25% of the original WQv volume has been
exceeded. The channel shall be provided with a permanent
concrete cleanout marker that indicates the 25% loss level.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:560
(k) Check dams along the channel length may be warranted.
(l) The bottom of dry swales shall be situated at least two feet
above the seasonal high-water table.
(4) Additional design information for open vegetated channels is
available in Design of Roadside Channels with Flexible Linings,
HEC 15, FHWA, September 2005.
D. Retention basins.
(1) Retention basins shall be designed to create a healthy ecological
community with sufficient circulation of water to prevent the
growth of unwanted vegetation and mosquitoes or other vectors. If
circulation cannot be provided via natural means, then artificial
aeration and circulation shall be provided. Care shall be taken to
landscape retention basins in accordance with § 190-17.
(2) The retention basin shall be of sufficient size to allow the
appropriate aquatic community needed to maintain healthy pond
ecology and avoid mosquitoes capable of carrying West Nile Virus
and other diseases. The Allegheny County Health Department,
Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, the Pennsylvania Extension Service, or other
qualified professional consultant shall be consulted during the
design of these facilities in order to ensure the health of aquatic
communities and minimize the risk of creating mosquito breeding
areas.
(3) An outlet structure shall be designed to allow complete drainage of
the pond for maintenance.
(4) The design of a retention basin shall include the determination of
the proposed site's ability to support a viable permanent pool. The
design shall take into account such factors as the available and
required rate and quality of dry weather inflow, the stormwater
inflow, seasonal and longer-term variations in groundwater table,
and impacts of potential pollutant loadings.
(5) Sediment storage volume equal to at least 20% of the volume of the
permanent pool shall be provided.
(6) A sediment forebay with a hardened bottom shall be provided at
each inlet into the retention basin. The forebay storage capacity
shall at minimum be 10% of the permanent pool storage. The
forebay shall be designed to allow for access by maintenance
equipment for periodic cleaning. A permanent concrete cleanout
marker shall be installed in the forebay to indicate the level where
25% capacity for the forebay storage has been used.
(7) Emergency spillways shall be sized and located to permit the safe
passage of stormwater flows from an unattenuated one-hundred-
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:561
year post-development storm with one foot of freeboard. The
maximum velocities in vegetated spillways excavated in otherwise
undisturbed soil shall be analyzed based upon the velocity of peak
flow in the emergency spillway during an assumed clogged primary
outlet condition. Where maximum velocities exceed design
standards contained in the Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices (USDA SCS, July 1984), suitable lining shall
be provided. All emergency spillways placed on fill materials shall
be lined. Lining for emergency spillways shall incorporate native
colors and materials where possible, including monoslab
revetments, grass pavers, riprap and native stone.
(8) Basin and pond embankments shall be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
design shall include an investigation of the subsurface conditions at
the proposed embankment location to evaluate settlement
potential, groundwater impacts, and the need for seepage controls.
The submittal of a geotechnical report from a geotechnical
engineer for any embankment over 10 feet in effective height or
posing a significant hazard to downstream property or life is
required. The selection of fill materials shall be subject to approval
of the design engineer. Fill shall be free of frozen soil, rocks over six
inches, sod, brush, stumps, tree roots, wood or other perishable
materials. Embankment fills less than 10 feet in fill height shall be
compacted using compaction methods that would reasonably
guarantee that the fill density is at least 90% of the maximum
density as determined by standard proctor (ASTM-698). All
embankment fills more than 10 feet in fill height shall be
compacted to at least 90% of the maximum density as determined
by standard proctor (ASTM-698) and shall have their density
verified by field density testing. A PADEP dam permit is required
for embankments having a maximum depth of water, measured
from the upstream toe of the dam to the top of the dam at maximum
storage elevation, of greater than 15 feet; and/or for ponds having a
contributory drainage area of greater than 100 acres; and/or for
impoundments of greater than 50 acre-feet.
(9) The embankment's interior slope shall not be steeper than 3:1
(three horizontal to one vertical). The exterior slope of the
embankment may not exceed 2:1 (two horizontal to one vertical).
(10) The minimum embankment width shall be four feet for
embankments less than six feet in height, six feet if the
embankment is between 6.1 feet and 9.9 feet in height and eight
feet if the embankment is between 10 feet and 15 feet in height.
(11) Existing ponds or permanent pool basins may be used for
stormwater management, provided that it can be demonstrated
that the ponds are structurally sound and meet the design
requirements herein.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:562
(12) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path through
the retention basin.
(13) Retention basins shall be designed to provide a length-to-width
ratio of at least 3L:1W as measured in plan view (for example, a
ratio of 4L:1W is too narrow).
(14) The retention basin depth shall average three feet to six feet.
(15) Fencing of the facility is not required if the interior slope of the
pond is 4H:1V or flatter and the design also includes a five-footwide
bench around the pond perimeter at an elevation one foot
below the permanent water surface elevation.
(16) Any side slopes below the permanent water surface level shall not
exceed 3H:1V. Interior side slopes above the permanent water
surface level shall not exceed 3H:1V.
(17) Stabilization. Proper stabilization structures, including stilling
basins, energy dissipators and channel lining, shall be constructed
at the outlets of all retention basins and emergency spillways. The
stabilization structures shall control water to avoid erosion, reduce
velocities of released water, and direct water so that it does not
interfere with downstream activities.
(18) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed to
prevent erosion and/or initiate sheet flow at points where pipes or
drainageways discharge to or from basins. Level spreaders shall be
used only where the maximum slope between the discharge point
and the waterway does not exceed 5%. Energy dissipators shall
comply with criteria in Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipators for
Culverts and Channels, HEC 14, FHWA, July 2006. Such facilities
shall be both functional and harmonious with the surrounding
environment, for example, native rock shall be used in constructing
dissipators where practical.
(19) Discharge points. The minimum distance between a proposed basin
discharge point (including the energy dissipator, etc.) and a
downstream property boundary shall in no case be less than 15
feet. Where there is discharge onto or through adjacent properties
prior to release to a stream, designers shall demonstrate how
downstream properties are to be protected. The Municipal
Engineer may require that the setback distance be increased based
upon factors such as topography, soil conditions, the size of
structures, the location of structures, and discharge rates. A
drainage easement may also be required.
(20) Outlet structures. Outlet structures shall meet the following
specifications:
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:563
(a) To minimize clogging and to facilitate cleaning and inspecting,
outlet pipes shall have an internal diameter of at least 15
inches and a minimum grade of 1%.
(b) Bentonite plugs shall be provided on all outlet pipes within a
constructed berm.
(c) All principal outlet structures shall be built using reinforced
concrete with watertight construction joints.

functional and harmonious in design with the surrounding
environment.
(e) Outlet pipes shall be constructed of reinforced concrete with
rubber gaskets, in conformance with AASHTO M170, M198
and M207, or smooth interior HDPE pipe in conformance with
AASHTO M252 or M294.
(f) Basin outlet structures shall have childproof, nonclogging
trash racks over all design openings exceeding 12 inches in
diameter, except those openings designed to carry perennial
stream flows. Periodic cleaning of debris from trash racks shall
be included in the operation and maintenance plan.
(g) Antivortex devices, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to
the basin berm, shall be provided at the top of all circular
risers or standpipes.
E. Detention basins.
(1) The landscape standards of § 190-17 shall apply.
(2) The maximum inside side slopes shall not exceed three horizontal
to one vertical (3H:1V). The minimum required slope for the basin
bottom is 2%. A level bottom is acceptable, provided that the
designer demonstrates to the Township's satisfaction that the basin
bottom shall be landscaped with appropriate wetland vegetation
pursuant to § 190-17. In addition, detention basins of sufficient size
and slope may serve other functions as well, including recreational
uses which do not hinder or conflict with the function of the
detention basin.
(3) Inlet structures. The inlet pipe invert into a basin shall be six inches
above the basin floor or lining so that the pipe can adequately drain
after rainstorms. Inlets shall discharge into areas of the basin that
slope toward the outlet structure.
(4) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path through
the retention basin.
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:564
(5) Low-flow channels. Low-flow channels constructed of concrete or
asphalt are not permitted. Where low-flow channels are necessary,
they shall be composed of a natural or bioengineered material.
Low-flow channels shall be designed to promote water quality and
slow the rate of flow through the basin. Low-flow channels may also
be designed to infiltrate where practical.
(6) Outlet structures. Outlet structures shall meet the following
specifications:
(a) To minimize clogging and to facilitate cleaning and inspection,
outlet pipes shall have an internal diameter of at least 15
inches and a minimum grade of 1%.
(b) Bentonite plugs shall be provided on all outlet pipes within a
constructed berm.
(c) All principal outlet structures shall be built using reinforced
concrete with watertight construction joints.
(d) The use of architecturally treated concrete, stucco, painted
surface or stone facade treatment shall be considered for
enhancing the outlet structure. Such facilities shall be both
functional and harmonious in design with the surrounding
environment.
(e) Outlet pipes shall be constructed of reinforced concrete with
rubber gaskets, in conformance with AASHTO M170, M198
and M207, or smooth-interior HDPE pipe in conformance with
AASHTO M252 or M294.
(f) Energy-dissipation facilities that convert concentrated flow to
uniform shallow sheet flow shall be used where appropriate.
(g) Basin outlet structures shall have childproof, nonclogging

stream flows.
(h) Antivortex devices, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to
the basin berm, shall be provided at the top of all circular
risers or standpipes.
(7) Emergency spillways shall be sized and located to permit the safe
passage of stormwater flows from an unattenuated one-hundredyear
post-development storm with one foot of freeboard. The
maximum velocities in vegetated spillways excavated in otherwise
undisturbed soil shall be analyzed based upon the velocity of peak
flow in the emergency spillway during an assumed clogged primary
outlet condition. Where maximum velocities exceed design
standards contained in the Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices (USDA SCS, July 1984), suitable lining shall
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:565
be provided. In general, emergency spillways shall not be located
in fill areas; all such facilities placed on fill materials shall be lined.
Lining for emergency spillways shall incorporate native colors and
materials where possible, including monoslab revetments, grass
pavers, riprap and native stone.
(8) Basin and pond embankments shall be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
design shall include an investigation of the subsurface conditions at
the proposed embankment location to evaluate settlement
potential, groundwater impacts and the need for seepage controls.
The submittal of a geotechnical report from a geotechnical
engineer for any embankment over 10 feet in effective height or
posing a significant hazard to downstream property or life is
required. The selection of fill materials shall be subject to approval
of the design engineer. Fill shall be free of frozen soil, rocks over six
inches, sod, brush, stumps, tree roots, wood or other perishable
materials. Embankment fills less than 10 feet in fill height shall be
compacted using compaction methods that would reasonably
guarantee that the fill density is at least 90% of the maximum
density as determined by standard proctor (ASTM-698). All
embankment fills more than 10 feet in fill height shall be
compacted to at least 90% of the maximum density as determined
by standard proctor (ASTM-698) and shall have their density
verified by field density testing. A PADEP dam permit is required
for embankments having a maximum depth of water, measured
from the upstream toe of the dam to the top of the dam at maximum
storage elevation, of greater than 15 feet; and/or for ponds having
contributory drainage area of greater than 100 acres; and/or for
impoundments of greater than 50 acre-feet.
(9) The embankment's interior slope shall not be steeper than 3:1
(three horizontal to one vertical). The exterior slope of the
embankment shall not exceed 2:1 (two horizontal to one vertical).
(10) The minimum embankment width shall be four feet for
embankments less than six feet in height, six feet if the
embankment is between 6.1 feet and 9.9 feet in height, and eight
feet if the embankment is between 10 feet and 15 feet in height.
(11) Fencing of the facility is not required if the interior slope of the
pond is 4:1 or flatter.
(12) Freeboard. Freeboard is the difference between the elevation of
the design flow in the emergency spillway (usually the onehundred-
year peak elevation) and the top elevation of the settled
basin embankment (that is, top of berm). The minimum freeboard
shall be one foot.
(13) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed to
prevent erosion and/or initiate sheet flow at points where pipes or
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:566
drainageways discharge to or from basins. Level spreaders shall be
used only where the maximum slope between the discharge point
and the waterway does not exceed 5%. Energy dissipators shall
comply with criteria in Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipators for
Culverts and Channels, HEC 14, FHWA, July 2006. Such facilities
shall be both functional and attractive; for example, native rock
shall be used in constructing dissipators where practical.
(14) Stabilization. Proper stabilization structures, including stilling
basins, energy dissipators and channel lining, shall be constructed
at the outlets of all basins and emergency spillways. The
stabilization structures shall control water to avoid erosion, reduce
velocities of released water, and direct water so that it does not
interfere with downstream activities.
(15) Discharge points. The minimum distance between a proposed basin
discharge point (including the energy dissipator, etc.) and a
downstream property boundary shall in no case be less than 15
feet. Where there is discharge onto or through adjacent properties
prior to release to a stream, designers shall demonstrate how
downstream properties are to be protected. The Municipal
Engineer may require that the setback distance be increased based
upon factors such as topography, soil conditions, the size of
structures, the location of structures and discharge rates. A
drainage easement may also be required.
(16) A sediment forebay with a hardened bottom shall be provided at
each inlet into the detention basin. The forebay storage capacity
shall at minimum be 10% of the permanent pool storage. The
forebay shall be designed to allow for access by maintenance
equipment for periodic cleaning.
F. Conveyance systems (open channels, drainageways and storm sewers).
(1) Applicants are encouraged to design conveyance systems that
encourage infiltration and improve water quality wherever
practicable.
(2) Wherever conveyance channels are necessary, drainage shall be
maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks designed to
carry the ten-year, twenty-four-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. The Municipal Engineer may
increase the design storm as conditions require. All open channels
shall be designed with one foot of freeboard above the design water
surface elevation of the design runoff condition.
(3) Flood relief channels shall be provided and designed to convey the
runoff from the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm such
that a positive discharge of this runoff to an adequate receiving
stream or conveyance system occurs without allowing this runoff to
encroach upon other properties.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:567
(4) Manholes and/or inlets shall not be spaced more than 300 feet
apart for pipe sizes up to 24 inches in diameter and not more than
450 feet apart for larger pipe sizes.
(5) Where drainage swales are used in lieu of or in addition to storm
sewers, they shall be designed to carry the required runoff without
erosion and in a manner not detrimental to the properties they
cross. Drainage swales shall provide a minimum grade of 2% but
shall not exceed a grade of 9%. Drainage swales used strictly for
conveyance are not the same as open vegetated channels. Design
standards for open vegetated channels are provided under of this
chapter.
(6) Street curbing for the purpose of stormwater conveyance is
discouraged. On streets that must contain curbing, storm sewers
shall be placed in front of the curbing. To the greatest extent
possible, storm sewers shall not be placed directly under curbing.
At curbed street intersections, storm inlets shall be placed in the
tangent section of the road.
(7) Use of grassed swales or open vegetated swales, in lieu of curbing,
to convey, infiltrate and/or treat stormwater runoff from roadways
is encouraged. Inlets shall be placed at the center of the shoulder
swale draining the street and shall be located no closer than four
feet from the edge of the cartway.
(8) When requested by the Township, the applicant shall obtain or
grant a minimum twenty-foot-wide drainage easement over all
storm sewers, drainage swales, channels, etc., that are a
component of the stormwater management system when located
within undedicated land. All permanent detention basins and/or
other stormwater management facilities providing stormwater
control for other than a single residential lot shall be located within
a defined drainage easement that allows proper legal access and
maintenance vehicle access.
(9) No property owner or applicant shall obstruct or alter the flow,
location or carrying capacity of a stream, channel or drainage
swale to the detriment of any other property owner, whether
upstream or downstream. All subdivision and/or land development
plans containing streams, channels, drainage swales, storm sewers
or other conveyance systems that cross property boundaries,
existing or proposed, or whose discharge crosses such boundaries
shall contain a note stating the above.
(10)Water quality inlets. Storm drainage systems that collect runoff
from parking areas and/or loading areas exceeding 10,000 square
feet of impervious coverage and discharge to stormwater
management systems, including surface or subsurface infiltration
systems, shall have a minimum of one water quality inlet per each
acre of drainage area. The purpose of water quality inlets is to
§ 190-16 SHALER CODE § 190-16
1:568
§ 190-17. Landscaping of stormwater management facilities.
Stormwater management facilities shall be landscaped in accordance with
the following standards:
remove oil, grease and heavy particulates or total suspended solids,
hydrocarbons and other floating substances from stormwater
runoff. Methods other than water quality inlets may be permitted
if the applicant demonstrates to the Township's satisfaction that
any such alternative will be as effective and as easily maintained.
Periodic cleaning of these systems shall be addressed in the
operation and maintenance plan submitted to the Township.
A. Landscaping shall be required in and around all constructed
stormwater management facilities with a minimum surface area of
1,000 square feet for the purposes of:
(1) Assisting in the management of stormwater;
(2) Stabilizing the soil within such facilities to minimize and control
erosion;
(3) Enhancing the visual appearance of such facilities; and
(4) Mitigating maintenance problems commonly associated with the
creation of such facilities.
B. A planting plan and planting schedule shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
(1) Wet meadows, including floors of stormwater management
facilities.
(a) Wet meadows and floors of stormwater management facilities
shall be planted with noninvasive plants native to western
Pennsylvania, such as wildflowers and noninvasive grasses, the
intent being to create a mixed meadow of such plantings,
where appropriate. Selection of plantings shall be based on
whether the area in question is usually well drained or
permanently wet and whether the area will be used for
recreation purposes. No woody plants shall be planted within
the saturated zone (phreatic line) of a stormwater
management practice or on a berm constructed for impounded
water.
(b) Seeding by drills, corrugated rollers, cyclone or drop seeders
or hand seeding of such areas is preferred; however,
hydroseeding followed by hydromulching can be used on wet
ground and steep slopes.
(c) Fertilizers, as a nutrient supplement, shall not be used unless it
is documented that soil conditions warrant such use and
nutrient applied does not exceed plant uptake. Soil for planting
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-17
1:569
of wildflowers shall contain not less than 3% or more than 10%
organic matter, as determined by an agricultural chemist, with
certification of the test before planting.
(d) Seeding shall take place either between April 1 and May 15 or
between September 1 and October 15. Planting areas shall be
soaked to maintain a consistent level of moisture for at least
four to six weeks after planting. For seeding recommendations,
reference the DEP's E&S Pollution Control Program Manual.
(e) Once established, a single annual mowing when plants are
dormant should be sufficient to maintain a wet meadow and/or
floor of a stormwater management practice.
(2) Wet edges that remain wet all or most of the year shall be planted
with wildflowers, grasses and shrubs. Plants to be located on rims
or banks which remain dry most of the year shall be planted with
species tolerant of dry soil conditions.
(3) Wooded areas.
(a) Where stormwater management facilities adjoin wooded areas,
trees and shrubs shall be selected and planted outside the
practice so as to blend with existing surroundings.
(b) Plantings in such areas shall be of sufficient density to
eliminate the need for mowing.
(c) It is recommended that clusters of trees and shrubs be planted
around stormwater management facilities but well away from
outfalls and any constructed berms, where applicable, to
provide for wildlife habitat, wind control and buffering and
screening.
(d) Vegetation shall be planted during appropriate times of the
year, predominantly between late March and mid-May or from
early October until evidence of ground freezing, depending
upon the species selected. Most deciduous trees and shrubs
can be planted in either spring or fall. Evergreens are best
planted in late summer or early fall.
(4) Slopes.
(a) Where slopes are gentle, a mixture of meadow grasses and
wildflowers (for wet meadows) shall be planted.
(b) On steep slopes, as defined by the Township's Code, dense
spreading shrubs (shrubs tolerant of dry soils) shall be planted.
Heavy mat mulch shall be used during the period of
establishment.
(c) No woody plant materials or trees shall be located on a
constructed or natural berm acting as the impoundment
§ 190-17 SHALER CODE § 190-17
1:570
§ 190-18. Stream buffer requirements.
Stream buffers shall be provided for new development sites as per the
following requirements:
structure of a stormwater management practice. Trees shall
be located downstream of an impoundment berm a sufficient
distance from the toe of the constructed slope to assure that
the toe of the slope is outside the dripline of the species
planted at maturity but in no case less than 15 feet.
(5) In cases where stormwater management facilities are to be located
in proximity to wetlands or waterways, the applicant's planting
plan and schedule shall consider the sensitive conditions existing
therein and be modified accordingly to reflect existing flora.
(6) Stormwater management facilities shall be screened in a manner
which complements the existing landscape and provides sufficient
access for maintenance.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams, keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. Except as required by 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, the riparian buffer
easement shall be required for all streams (as defined in Article II) with
a contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The riparian
buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the
top of the stream bank (on each side).
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in § 190-18A.
(2) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(3) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
§ 190-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-18
1:571
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Township and
shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds office,
so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property
located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private
ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area required by
zoning, unless otherwise specified in the Township Zoning
Ordinance.119
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing onehundred-
year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical
distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not
permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
G. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the Township within riparian buffers:
(1) It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for
nonmotorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted,
provided that they have adequate drainage.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed, and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest
practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as
required.

A. Said application shall be made to the Township Secretary, who shall

individual or company shall be permitted to place with the Township a
cash bond in the amount of $500, which shall be held by the Township

make said repairs and deduct the cost thereof from the cash bond so on
deposit, and no further street openings will be granted to that
individual or company until the cash bond is brought back to the
original figure of $500. The individual or company having said cash
bond of $500 on deposit may have the same released at his or its

such a manner as will conform to the earth shoulder.

contractor, plumber or other person, and if the sum so deposited is not
sufficient to cover the cost to perform said work, said Township is hereby
authorized to take such steps as are necessary to collect the balance due
from either the owner, contractor, plumber or other person, or all of them,
by appropriate action.
§ 192-6. Refund of deposit.
In the event that the restorative costs do not consume the deposit, the
balance remaining shall be refunded to the depositor; and likewise, the
depositor is entitled to a refund of his deposit when the Township has
not incurred any costs by reason of said opening. Said refund shall be
returned only after the expiration of six months from date of application,
upon resolution of the Board of Commissioners.

or as soon as they become available. The location of the hydrants
shall be approximately every 1,000 feet and shall be subject to
approval by the Township on the final plat.
B. Sanitary sewage disposal.
(1) Each property shall connect with an approved public sewer system.
Where the sewer is not yet provided, the applicant shall install the
sewer line, including lateral connections as may be necessary to
provided adequate service to each lot when connection with the
sewer system is made. The sewer lines shall be suitably capped at
the limits of the subdivision or development, and the laterals shall
be capped at the street right-of-way line.
(2) All plats submitted for approval must show sanitary drains
separated from all other drains. No stormwater shall be permitted
in sanitary drains.
(3) All plats, designs, and data of any new sewage system or for
extension for tapping into any existing system shall be submitted to
the Township for approval and be subject to all its requirements.
(4) The subdivider shall contract the necessary and required sanitary
sewer lines which shall, when possible, be connected to the public
sewer system serving the Township or a portion thereof.
(5) If, in the opinion of the Allegheny County Health Officer, the
Township Engineer and/or the Township Board of Commissioners,
factors exist which would create a public health and sanitation
problem if a certain area is developed, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall not, in those cases, approve the subdivision and platting of
such area until such factors are corrected by an adequate sanitary
sewer system.
C. Propane. All propane installation shall be subject to prior approval of
the Township Engineer or other person designated by the Township and
the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.
A. Blocks.
(1) Layout. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined
with due regard to:

1,000 feet, special consideration shall be given to the
requirements of satisfactory fire protection. Where
practicable, blocks along arterial and collector streets shall not
be less than 1,000 feet long.
(3) Length in commercial and industrial districts. Blocks in commercial
and industrial areas may vary from the elements of design detailed
above, if required by the nature of the use. Any subdivision of land
or land development in the commercial or industrial districts shall
take into consideration the feasibility of creating roads on the lot
that minimize intersections with arterial, collector or local roads. In
all cases, however, adequate provisions shall be made for off-street
parking and loading areas as well as for traffic circulation and
parking for employees and customers.
(4) Depth. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except:
(a) Where through lots are required along a major traffic street.
(b) Where prevented by the size, topographical conditions or other
inherent conditions of property, in which case the Planning
Commission may approve a single tier of lots.
(5) Lot or parcel numbers. Lot numbers or lettered parcels shall be
assigned and approved prior to filing the final subdivision and/or
land development plat.

preliminary discussions are held and prior to filing a preliminary
plat.
A. Stakeout. In order to assure the Township staff and the Township
Engineer that the road is being paved in the center of the right-of-way
and in accordance with all grades that may have heretofore been
approved, the contractor, applicant and/or road builder must present an
affidavit, signed by a minimum-licensed Pennsylvania title surveyor,
that he has established the recorded and/or legal right-of-way on the
ground by a survey on the ground and has set construction stakes to the
desired construction offset distance at points along the road not
exceeding fifty-foot intervals and has established reference elevation on
said stakes to effect the construction of the road in accordance with all
plans that have been previously approved.
B. Grading.
(1) All streets shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and
the adjacent side slopes graded to blend with the natural lay of the
land, or in accordance with the cross section presented, to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer. The slope of the ground of
the entire right-of-way line must be graded toward the paving to
the satisfaction of the Township Engineer or other designated
Township officials. An alternate grading plan may be submitted to
the Planning Commission and approved by the Township Engineer.
When filling operations are required, all topsoil must be removed
and the surface roughed up or scarified in order to assure a good
§ 195-77 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-78
1:661
bond between the filled ground and virgin ground. (If the lateral
slope upon which the fill is to be made is deemed too steep for
scarifying to make bond, then the virgin ground must first be
benched and the fill placed upon the benches). Drainage for any
springs, wet areas, existing streams or wet weather gullies
encountered while preparing for filling operations must be
approved by Shaler Township before filling can be commenced.
Fills must be built up with six-inch layers of suitable rock-free,
nonfrozen material, each layer being well compacted with an
approved sheepsfoot ten-ton roller or equivalent approved by
Shaler Township, and well crowned and drained to prevent soaking
and spongy areas. Where fill materials are necessary to establish
uniform grades, compacting shall be required to 95% density and
shall be so certified by a qualified soils technician. No paving shall
be placed in any fill area until at least two months have elapsed
since the filling operation was completed. A slope of two horizontal
to one vertical foot beyond the right-of-way line in cut or fill shall be
required as the maximum slope, except for extraordinary situations
approved by Shaler Township.
(2) Street cross sections for all streets shall be in accordance with the
standards established by Shaler Township or elsewhere herein. All
details of the cross section, crowns, curb, pavement, subgrade and
roadside ditches shall conform to the designated cross section.
(State approval shall also be obtained where necessary.)
(3) The subgrade shall be well rolled with an approved three-wheel,
ten-ton-minimum roller, crowned in conformance with the finished
surface crown, and must be perfectly smooth and free of spongy
areas as well as drained with approved subgrade drains and/or
bleeders, the bleeders draining into approved dry wells
(constructed at a minimum distance of three feet from the edge of
paving), lateral drains, storm sewers or drop inlets. In all cases the
flow lines of the aforementioned dry wells, lateral drains, storm
sewers and drop inlets must be at least 18 inches to three feet
below the lowest part of the subgrade. All drainage must be
constructed and in operation before any fine grading, berm
construction or filling commences. The width of the subgrade shall
include the area to be paved, plus the area of any curbs, berms or
sidewalks.
C. Berms. Where required, built-up rolled berms shall be constructed
along each edge paving using suitable and approved material (which
shall not include red dog or ashes) with a minimum width of three feet
and sloping toward the paving at a minimum slope of two inches per
foot, using the top of the curb for the start of the upward slope. The
berm shall be constructed before the curb or base is constructed and
simultaneously with the fine grading of the subgrade.

installed. Generally, this will mean that subsurface drainage must
be installed in the high side of any cut unless approved otherwise.
(3) Where conditions warrant, a geotextile shall be installed for the
separation of subgrade and subbase aggregate. Geotextiles shall
meet the PennDOT Publication 408 specifications for "Furnishing
and Installing Geotextiles."
E. Base course. The applicant shall construct a base course in accordance
with either of the following alternatives, the Township reserving the
right to specify either alternative and/or to modify either alternative:
(1) A stone base, properly drained, at least eight inches thick, placed in
two layers each approximately four inches thick, the material to be
in accordance with the Specifications of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, Form 408. (This base must be used
under any concrete paving.)
(2) An ID-2 asphaltic concrete base course (black base), properly
placed and compacted to a minimum thickness of 5 1/2 inches, the
material and installation to be in accordance with the specifications
of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Form 408.
(3) The applicant shall install said base before any excavation or
construction of dwelling units or building units is undertaken.

A. Road construction such as filling, berming, subgrade, fine-grade
construction, base construction or surface construction cannot be
commenced before April 1 and must be completed before October 31 of
the same year, unless special permission is granted by the Township
Board of Commissioners otherwise. (It is assumed that the weather
conditions between these dates will be ideal for road construction;
however, if adverse weather conditions occur between these dates, the
contractor or builder must abide by the judgment of the Township
Board of Commissioners, its agents, or assigns, in regard to permissible
construction weather conditions.)
B. Testing and repair.
(1) Prior to acceptance by the Township, all roads shall be core bored
at locations to be determined by the Township Engineer, by a
reputable firm certified to do such work. All cores shall be tested
for compliance with all applicable paving regulations and shall

A. In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the
degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan
has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic
to the site shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject
to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
existing natural features such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded
areas and watercourses.
B. Open space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish, a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work,"
which will confine excavation, earthmoving procedures and other
changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure preservation and
prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space.
§ 195-80 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-83
1:667
§ 195-84. Erosion and sediment control.
C. Tree preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within
the proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
D. Topsoil preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills
have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes
10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater.
E. Landscaping. For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall
be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open
space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and
natural barriers.
F. Buffer planting requirements. Buffer yard requirements should be as
specified in the Township Zoning Ordinance.154
G. Preserved landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to preserve
the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such
preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable to
required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer screening,
the plan may be approved in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
H. Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not
be permitted without the consent of the Township. The planting of any
trees within the private property of each residential lot shall be at the
discretion of the landowner and/or developer.
I. Watercourse protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural
drainage.
A. General purpose.
(1) The Township Board of Commissioners finds that the minimization
of erosion and control of sedimentation in connection with land
development and subdivision are in the public interest, affecting
public health, safety and welfare, and therefore those regulations
governing erosion control and sedimentation control are necessary
for the Township.
154. Editor's Note: See Ch. 225, Zoning.
§ 195-83 SHALER CODE § 195-84
1:668
(2) No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, and no
grading, excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or
other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced, until such
time that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Township Engineer and/or the
Allegheny County Conservation District, or there has been a
determination by the above entities that such plans are not
necessary.
(3) No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
i) there has been an erosion and sedimentation control plan
approved by the Township Board of Commissioners that provides
for minimizing erosion and sedimentation, and an improvement
bond or other acceptable securities are deposited with the
Township in the form of an escrow guaranty which will ensure
installation and completion of the required improvements; or ii)
there has been a determination by the Township Board of
Commissioners that a plan for minimizing erosion and
sedimentation is not necessary.
(4) Where not specified, measures used to control erosion and reduce
sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the standards and
specifications of the Allegheny County Conservation District and
the State Clean Streams Act,155 and shall comply with applicable
regulations of the Department of Environmental Protection. The
Township Engineer, or other officials as designated, shall ensure
compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies of which are
available from the Soil and Water Conservation District.
B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected,
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
155. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 195-84 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-84
1:669
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
(8) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps, or similar measures.
C. Grading for erosion and other environmental controls. In order to
provide a suitable site for building and other uses, improve surface
drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
(1) Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition as one of the first items of work done on a
subdivision or development. The wearing surface shall be installed
as approved in the final plan.
(2) Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavation, or the sloping surfaces of fills, by
installation of temporary or permanent drainage across or above
these areas.
(3) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(4) Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable protection
against erosion during periods of flooding.
(5) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
(6) Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams, unless permitted by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
D. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective
responsibility of the applicant, and of the contractor, person,
corporation and other entity causing such sedimentation, to
remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses and to repair any damage at their expense as quickly
as possible.
(2) Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the
responsibility of the applicant.
§ 195-84 SHALER CODE § 195-84
1:670
§ 195-85. Floodplain area regulations.
See Chapter 130, Flood Damage Prevention.
(3) It is the responsibility of any applicant, and any person,
corporation, or other entity doing any act on or across a communal
stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-ofway,
to maintain as nearly as possible in its present state the
stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during the
pendency of the activity to return it to its original or equal
condition after such activity is completed.
(4) The applicant shall provide and install, at his expense, in
accordance with Township requirements, all drainage and erosion
control improvements (temporary and permanent) shown on the
erosion and sediment control plan.
E. Compliance with regulations and procedures.
(1) The Township Board of Commissioners, in its consideration of all
preliminary plans of subdivision and land development, shall
condition its approval upon the execution of erosion and sediment
control measures.
(2) The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with standards and
specifications of the Allegheny County Soil Conservation District
and EPA Clean Water Act.156
(3) Stream channel construction. Stream channel construction on
watersheds with drainage areas in excess of 1/2 square mile, or in
those cases where downstream hazards exist, will conform to
criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.

expenses as reported to or determined by the Department of Revenue

amount of unpaid tax and an additional penalty of 1/2 of 1% of the amount
of unpaid tax, for each month or fraction of month during which the tax
remains unpaid, shall be added and collected. Whenever suit is brought
for the recovery of unpaid tax, the taxpayer shall, in addition, be liable for
the costs of collection as well as for interest and penalties. The Collector
may accept payment under protest of the tax claimed by the Township in
any case where any person disputes the Township's claim for the tax. If
a court of competent jurisdiction thereafter decides that there has been
overpayment to the Collector, the Collector shall refund the amount of the
overpayment to the person who paid under protest.

entitled to the refund. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax to the
Collector for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest imposed under 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426 (relating to
interest on overpayment). A refund shall be provided only for an amount
overpaid in a calendar year that exceeds $1. The Collector shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment of the tax upon request by the taxpayer.

§ 201-37. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,

exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
Shaler Township; provided, however, that Shaler Township and any
other political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by § 201-36 shall not be imposed upon:

the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,

transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent

spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all

acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.

conversion, energy production, pollution control, warehousing or
agriculture, and the agency or authority has the full ownership
interest in the real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in

persons holding title for a religious organization, if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

Value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change

with prior changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or

§ 201-56. Short title.
This article shall be known as the Township of Shaler "Earned Income Tax
Registration Ordinance."
§ 201-57. Purpose and intent.
This article is adopted to promote the efficient and systematic collection of
earned income taxes by the Shaler Township Earned Income Tax Collector,
to set forth a uniform time within which all employed residents must

to avoid payment of the earned income tax by failing to register employment
with the Earned Income Tax Collector.
§ 201-58. Rules of construction.

As used in this article, the following terms will have the meanings indicated:
DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his permanent home and
to which he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent. Actual
residence is not necessarily domicile, for domicile is the fixed place of
abode which, in the intention of the taxpayer, is permanent rather than
transitory. Domicile is the voluntarily fixed place of habitation of a person,
not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of
making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt
some other permanent home. In the case of businesses or associations, the
domicile is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the
place where its functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME TAX COLLECTOR  The person, public employee or
private agency designated by the Board of Commissioners of the Township
of Shaler to collect and administer the tax on earned income and net profits.
A. Words used in the singular shall include the plural, and the plural the
singular.

1:723
RESIDENT  A person, partnership, association or other entity domiciled
in the Township of Shaler.

required hereunder to file a return of earned income or net profits or
income tax thereon.
§ 201-60. Registration required.
All employed residents of the Township of Shaler shall register with the
Earned Income Tax Collector within 30 days of residency or, if already a
resident, within 30 days of employment, whichever first occurs.
§ 201-61. Failure to register.
It is a violation of this article for any employed Township resident or
taxpayer to not register with the Earned Income Tax Collector within 30
days of residency or, if already a resident, within 30 days of employment,
whichever first occurs.
§ 201-62. Violations and penalties.
Any person, partnership or corporation who violates any of the provisions
of this article shall, upon conviction in a summary proceeding, be fined not
less than $500 and, in default of the payment of fines and costs, shall be
committed to the Allegheny County Jail for a period not to exceed 30 days.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to preclude the Township to seek
other relief or avail itself of any remedy that may be available at law or in
equity to prevent continuing violations of the terms of this article.
§ 201-63. Filing of copies.
The Township Manager shall file an exact copy of this article with the
Department of Community and Economic Development as well as with the

article.

for that proportionate part of the fiscal year of the Township remaining after
the issuance of an occupancy permit or a building is otherwise occupied

of the Board of Commissioners. If the person desires that the special
hauling permit be renewed for an extension of time, which shall not
exceed 90 days, such person shall reapply to the Township Engineer
and shall pay a renewal fee as defined by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners and post the appropriate bond.

shall be open to inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of
the Township of Shaler or any person having any accident involving
such vehicle.

department personnel, flagmen and/or directional personnel.
H. The Township Engineer or his appointee, as the case may be, may,
within his sole and absolute discretion, revoke the special hauling
permit at any time for cause. Permits may be conditioned by limiting the
number of trips or by establishing seasonal or other time limitations,
geographical limitations or limitations as to prescribed roads and
streets or by otherwise prescribing conditions of operation under the
permit as the Township Engineer may deem necessary.

I. No person, individual, partnership, association, firm or corporation or
other legal entity shall drive, operate, move or be in actual physical
control of a motor vehicle, semitrailer, trailer or equipment upon the
roadways, streets or trafficways of the Township in such a manner as to
cause damage to the roadway, street or trafficway when the roads are
soft because of weather conditions.
J. No person shall drive, move, operate or be in actual physical control of
any motor vehicle, semitrailer, trailer or equipment within the Township
of Shaler unless such motor vehicle is so constructed and loaded so as
to prevent any load, contents or litter from being blown or deposited
upon any street, roadway or trafficway in the Township.
K. No person shall drive, move or operate any motor vehicle, semitrailer,
trailer or equipment within the Township, the wheels of which carry
onto or deposit on any street, roadway or trafficway in the Township
any mud, dirt, sticky substances, litter or foreign matter of any kind.
L. If in the course of excavation, building, construction or development of
any property any mud or dirt or any other foreign substance is
unavoidably carried or washed onto any street, roadway or trafficway in
the Township, it shall be the duty of the property owner and/or
contractor having supervision over the job to remove the same no later
than 5:00 p.m., prevailing time, of each day so as to make the street,
roadway or trafficway clean and safe for the passage of normal
vehicular traffic.
M. The Township shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained weight
restrictions signs designating the restriction at each end of a bridge or
portion of road or street restricted. In the case of a restriction on a
bridge or a road or street which does not begin or end at an intersection
with an unrestricted highway, the Township shall also place an advance
informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted
bridge or portion of road or street. No person shall be convicted of
violating Subsection B, C, D, E, F or G of this section unless the
restriction sign designating the restricted bridge, road or street to
traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as
required by this section. However, failure to post the restriction sign
designating the restricted bridge, road or street to traffic moving in the
opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign
shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section.
N. Penalties.
(1) Whoever violates any provisions of Subsection B, C, D, E, F, G or H
is guilty of an offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to
pay a fine of not less than $300 plus costs, and any person
exceeding the maximum allowable gross weight by more than
3,000 pounds shall pay an additional fine of $75 for each 500
pounds or part thereof in excess of 3,000 pounds over the
§ 212-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-17
1:737
maximum allowable gross limit. Each day of operation shall
constitute a separate offense.
(2) Whoever violates Subsection I, J, K or L or whoever drives, moves,
operates or is in the actual physical control of a motor vehicle in
violation of any restriction of the special hauling permit is guilty of
a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay
a fine of not more than $300 plus costs. Each day a violation is
committed or is permitted to continue shall constitute a separate
violation.
(3) Upon imposition of any fine and costs of prosecution imposed, the
driver shall be allowed 48 hours to obtain the funds and pay the
fine and costs of prosecution, during which time the vehicle,
equipment or combination shall be rendered temporarily
inoperative by such police officer as the issuing authority shall
designate. On default of payment within said forty-eight-hour
period, the issuing authority shall impound the vehicle, equipment
or combination and order a police officer to seize it. Upon
impoundment, the issuing authority shall forthwith notify the
appropriate law enforcement officer of the county in which the
violation occurred, who shall store the impounded vehicle,
equipment or combination. The officer shall give immediate notice
by the most expeditious means and by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of the impoundment and location of the vehicle,
equipment or combination to the owner of the vehicle, equipment
or combination and to the owner of the load, if the names and
addresses of the owner are known or can be ascertained. The
police officer's costs, reasonable storage costs and all other
reasonable costs incident to seizure and impounding shall be
recoverable in addition to costs of prosecution.
(4) The title to the load of an impounded vehicle, equipment or
combination remains in the owner, who may repossess the load at
any time upon presentation of proof of ownership to the Sheriff. If
the load spoils during impoundment, the loss shall be on the owner,
subject to any right of recovery of damages that the owner may
have against the owner of the vehicle, equipment or combination or
against any other party, and the costs of disposition of the load shall
be recoverable in addition to the costs of prosecution. In case any
impounded vehicle, equipment or combination is unredeemed or
the load is unclaimed for a period of 60 days after notice of
impoundment is given, it shall be sold at a public sale by the Sheriff
upon order of the issuing authority and after 10 days' notice of sale
to the owners, lienholders or secured parties of the vehicle or load,
except that, if the Sheriff determines it to be necessary to preserve
their value, goods which may spoil may be sold in any commercially
reasonable manner prior to expiration of the sixty-day period and, if
impractical to do so, without giving notice to the owners,
lienholders or secured parties. The proceeds of sale shall first be

Removal and Impounding of Certain Vehicles
§ 212-28. Applicability and scope.
This article is enacted under authority of Section 6109(a)(22) of the Vehicle
Code and gives authority to the Township to remove and impound vehicles
that are parked overtime on any street in the Township in violation of any
provision of Article I, Article II or Article III of this chapter.
§ 212-29. Authority to remove and impound.
The Township shall have authority to remove and impound, or to order
the removal and impounding, of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise
illegally, provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the
conditions stated in § 212-28 of this article, and provided that no such
vehicle shall be removed or impounded except in strict adherence to the
provisions of this article.
§ 212-30. Designation of approved storage garages; bonding;
storage.
Impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only by approved
storage garages that shall be designated from time to time by the Board
of Commissioners. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the Board
of Commissioners that it is bonded or has acquired liability insurance in
an amount satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners as sufficient to
indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those
vehicles while in the custody of the garage keeper for the purpose of
towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to the Board
of Commissioners its schedule of charges under this article, and when the
schedule is approved by the Board of Commissioners, those charges shall
be adhered to by the approved storage garage. No different schedule of
charges shall be adopted without approval of the Board of Commissioners,
and no different charges shall be demanded of or collected from any person

for its removal and impounding, and the garage in which it was impounded.

1:743
§ 212-32. Effect of payment of towing and storage fees.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a Magisterial District Court.
Payment of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver
of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the
provision of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 212-33. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The Township shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded

Dumpsters and Portable Storage Units
§ 212-35. Prohibition.
On and after the effective date of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for
any person or entity to construct or place a dumpster or a PODS® upon
any Township street, avenue, highway, lane, alley or public place in the
Township except as authorized by this chapter and without first having
obtained a permit to do so from the Township. Cleaning dumpsters on a
street or a sidewalk is not permitted.
§ 212-36. Hazardous materials.
The use of dumpsters or portable storage units for the storage of hazardous
materials is prohibited. Upon reasonable suspicion and reasonable notice
to the applicant or resident, the Township Code Enforcement Officer may
inspect a dumpster or a portable storage unit to ensure no such materials
are being stored therein.
§ 212-37. Permit required for streets or other public places.
A permit is required from the Township to construct or place a dumpster or
a PODS® upon any Township street, avenue, highway, lane, alley, a public
sidewalk or other public right-of-way or public place in the Township.
§ 212-38. Requirements for issuance of a permit.
A. The Township Code Enforcement Officer may issue a permit to
construct or place a dumpster or a PODS® on a Township street,
avenue, highway, lane, alley or public place in the Township but only if
the dumpster or portable storage unit will not create a danger to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic or public safety and only if the
applicant establishes a hardship by satisfying one or more of the
following criteria:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to
the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions and to the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, making the placement of
the dumpster or portable storage unit elsewhere on said private
property or on a public area difficult, if not impossible.
(2) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
§ 212-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-38
1:745
(3) That the requested permit, if granted, will not substantially impair
the appropriate use of any other property and will not be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(4) That the permit if issued will be issued only after the Code
Enforcement Officer has inspected the specific requested location
where the dumpster or PODS® is to be constructed or placed.
B. Before placing a dumpster or a portable storage unit on a Township
street, avenue, highway, lane, alley or public place in the Township, the
applicant shall submit an application, together with a permit fee in the
amount of $75 or such other fee as the Board of Commissioners may set
from time to time by resolution, and receive a permit from the
Township. A liability insurance certificate in the amount of $100,000
and naming the Township of Shaler as an additional insured party shall
be provided by the company supplying the dumpster or PODS® and
must accompany the application. However, a liability insurance
certificate is not required to be submitted by the applicant if the
Township already has on file an insurance certificate submitted by the
same company within the past calendar year and the insurance
certificate remains current. At time of application, the applicant shall
also deposit with the Township the sum of $500 guaranteeing that the
applicant shall repair any street or highway damaged by the permitted
dumpster or portable storage unit, which sum shall be returned to the
applicant but only if, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, no
damage to the street or highway occurs.
C. The Code Enforcement Officer may attach such reasonable safeguards
as deemed necessary so that the dumpster or a PODS® will not create a
danger to vehicular and pedestrian traffic or public safety, including but
not limited to:
(1) Flashers and reflectors on the outside corners facing traffic at all
times. Where traffic may approach from either direction, the
dumpster must have flashers and reflectors on the outside corners
on both sides.
(2) Type I and Type II barricades may be used as an alternative to
flashers and reflectors if authorized by the Code Enforcement
Officer and the Township Police Department.
(3) Dumpsters and portable storage units may not restrict the sight
lines of intersections as determined by the Code Enforcement
Officer.
D. A permit issued under this section by the Code Enforcement Officer to
construct or place a dumpster or a PODS® on a Township street,
avenue, highway, lane, alley or public place in the Township shall be for
a maximum period of 30 days. Permits to construct or place a dumpster
or a PODS® on a Township street, avenue, highway, lane, alley or public
place in the Township for a period in excess of 30 days shall require the
approval of the Township Board of Commissioners.
§ 212-38 SHALER CODE § 212-38
1:746
§ 212-39. Removal.
Any dumpster or PODS® which is not removed at the end of the time
for which it may lawfully remain on any street or other public place or
immediately upon the direction of the Township Code Enforcement Officer
for removal of such dumpster or POD for safety reasons may be removed
by the Township immediately, without notice, and the cost of such removal,
together with the cost of administration of its removal, may be assessed
against the property on which the dumpster or PODS® was located and may
be filed as a lien against such property.
§ 212-40. Violations and penalties.
Any person, persons, firm, partnership or corporation violating any of the
provisions of this article shall, upon conviction thereof before any
Magisterial District Judge, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more $600 plus
costs of prosecution and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration not
exceeding 90 days, or both. Each and every day that the offense continues
shall be considered as a separate offense and shall be subject to separate
and distinct penalties.
§ 212-41. Additional penalties; abatement.
In addition to the penalties provided in § 212-40 above, the Board of
Commissioners shall have the power, in default of the abatement of the
violation by the person, firm or corporation involved after proper notice,
to cause the necessary work to be done to accomplish said abatement and
collect the cost, together with a penalty of 10% of said cost therefor, from
the person, firm or corporation responsible therefor.
§ 212-42. (Reserved)168
E. Any permit may be revoked by the Code Enforcement Officer if it is
determined that the location of the dumpster or portable storage unit is
affecting traffic flow or public safety.

system from a source other than its intended source.
BACKFLOW PREVENTER  A device or other means which will prevent the
backflow of water or liquids of questionable quality into the public water
supply system.
BACKSIPHONAGE  The backflow of water or mixture of water and other

entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply in
the event of backflow from the customer's facility.
CONTAMINATION  The degradation of the quality of the drinking water to
a quality less than accepted drinking water quality. The degradation would
be to a degree which would create an actual hazard to the public health

quality of the water in the public water supply system.
CROSS-CONNECTION  An arrangement allowing either a direct or
indirect connection through which backflow, including backsiphonage, can
occur between the drinking water in a public water system and a system
containing a source or potential source of contamination.
DEGREE OF HAZARD  An evaluation of the potential risk to health and
the adverse effect upon the public water supply system.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY  An assembly composed of two

testing the watertightness of each check valve.
HEALTH HAZARD  Any condition, device or practice in a water system or
its operation that creates or may create a danger to the health and wellbeing
of its users. The word "severe" as used to qualify "health hazard"
means a hazard to the health of the user that could reasonably be expected
to result in significant morbidity or death.
INTERCHANGEABLE CONNECTION  An arrangement or device that will
allow alternative, but not simultaneous, use of two sources of water.
§ 218-11 SHALER CODE § 218-11

REDUCED PRESSURE ZONE (RPZ) DEVICE  A minimum of two
independently acting check valves, together with an automatically operated
pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves.
During normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow, the pressure
between the two checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of
leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to
the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks
at less than the supply pressure. The unit must include tightly closing
shutoff valves located at each end of the device, and each device shall be
fitted with properly located test cocks.

(7) General riverfront development criteria. A riverfront development
plan for a riverfront development shall be approved if, and only if, it
is found to meet the following criteria:
(a) Comprehensive Plan. The proposed riverfront development
preserves the community development objectives of this article
and is consistent with the Township Comprehensive Plan and
"Allegheny Places," the Allegheny County Comprehensive Plan.
(b) Compatibility. The proposed riverfront development physically
integrates with the larger community of which it is a part in the
following ways:
[1] Physical access is provided throughout the development in
order to connect the community with the riverfront.
(c) Riverfront. The proposed riverfront development incorporates
plans and means for improving public access to, use of, and
enjoyment of the scenic and other assets of the Allegheny River
and furthers the goals of the Township relative to the use and
preservation of riverfront property.
(d) Comparable departure. Where the proposed riverfront
development departs from zoning and subdivision and land
development regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property, such departures must be shown to be in the public
interest and promote the health, safety and general welfare of
the public.
(e) Common open space. The proposals for the maintenance and
conservation of any proposed common open space are reliable,
and the amount and extent of improvements of such common
open space are adequate with respect to the purpose, use and
type of development proposed.
(f) Infrastructure. The physical design of the proposed riverfront
development adequately provides for public services,
pedestrian and vehicle traffic facilities and parking, light, air,
recreation and visual enjoyment.
(g) Safety. No use or design feature in the proposed riverfront
development shall involve any element or cause any condition
§ 225-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-10
1:809
or traffic hazard that may be dangerous, injurious or noxious
to any other property or persons. Consideration of potential
traffic hazards shall include, but not be limited to, the effect of
the riverfront development on traffic congestion on the roads,
streets, and highways affected by the riverfront development.
(h) Timing. In the case of a riverfront development plan which
proposes development over a period of years, the riverfront
development will provide at each stage of development a
proportion of open space, planned facilities and amenities, and
other improvements equal to the stage's proportion of the
entire development. Conditions as required in this article and
as intended to protect the interests of the public and of the
residents of the riverfront development and the integrity of the
riverfront development plan shall also be met.
(8) Riverfront infill development.
(a) Procedure. Riverfront infill developments are authorized in the
Township Riverfront Overlay. All riverfront infill developments
shall follow the procedure for conditional use in this chapter.
(b) Authorized uses. The following uses, and only the following
uses, are authorized in a riverfront infill development, provided
their design, arrangement, landscaping, relationship to
adjacent properties and uses, and construction form a
compatible and harmonious group of uses, afford reasonable
protection to adjacent development, and otherwise meet all
requirements set forth in this article:
[1] Parks, open space, trails and fishing access.
[2] Development associated with the municipal wells and
other public infrastructure.
(c) Required improvements. The following improvements shall be
completed in connection with every riverfront infill

Chapter 195, Subdivision of Land, or other Township, county or
state law.
[1] Off-street parking spaces and off-street loading spaces
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The Commissioners may approve alternate design
standards for off-street parking in response to specific site
conditions, such as attendant parking, indoor parking,
interaction between abutting uses, accessibility to mass
transit, bike and pedestrian systems, river transportation,
or a clearly documented difference between expected
parking load and required parking spaces.
§ 225-10 SHALER CODE § 225-10
1:810
[2] Parking lots having an area of 4,000 square feet or more
shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs and other plantings

landscaped border not less than five feet in width, and
the lot shall be screened from every adjacent
residential use.
[b] A landscaped island of not less than 100 square feet
shall be installed to separate long rows of parking
stalls into groups of 10 or less stalls. Each island shall
contain at least two three-and-one-half-inch-caliper
trees and shall be planted in grass or other ground
cover.

space may be required to provide a landscaped
hedgerow, low wall or similar landscaping device to
adequately screen parked cars from view of the street
or adjacent use.
[3] Streetlights shall be provided by the developer throughout
the riverfront infill development. Lighting standards for
pedestrian areas and walkways shall not be higher than 12
feet above ground level; lighting standards for parking
areas and streets shall not be higher than 18 feet above
ground level; all lighting shall conform to § 225-50.
Streetlights shall be located to ensure adequate
illumination in order to protect the safety of the visitors
and residents of the riverfront development.
[4] Streets shall be related to street plans or parts thereof as
have been officially adopted by the Township. Proposed
streets shall conform to the requirements herein as well as
to any other plans, statute, ordinance, law or regulation
applicable thereto. Streets shall be logically related to the
topography in order that usable sites and reasonable
grades shall be produced. Provisions will be required to
accommodate traffic from adjacent areas, but minor
streets should be laid out so as to discourage through
traffic.
[5] Where a riverfront development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed major street, the Commissioners may
require marginal access streets, rear service alleys,
reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will
provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in
the number of intersections with major streets, and
separation of local and through traffic.
§ 225-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-10
1:811
[6] Drainage structures, culverts, storm sewers, ditches and

any structure located beside the river or in a convenient
and attractive location. Walkways shall have a paved width
of not less than four feet and be so improved as to assure
accessibility to handicapped persons.

riverfront. This trail shall connect with adjacent trails and
form a continuous trail along the riverfront.
[10] Bikeways, where provided, shall meet the requirements of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Highway
Design Manual (Publication 13M) Chapter 16.
[11] Erosion and sedimentation control. When topsoil has been
removed from the surface on a slope where erosion may
cause a displacement of loose material, the area shall be
seeded or otherwise treated as soon as possible to prevent
damage to adjacent property or streets.
[12] Utilities located within a riverfront development shall all
be located underground.
D. The provisions for the overlay districts shall supplement the
requirements for the underlying zoning districts contained in this
chapter.

associated structures, may be located on Township property and on
Township facilities in any zoning district if authorized by the Board and
shall be permitted as a conditional use in C Cemetery Districts, GC General
Commercial Districts and I Industrial Districts of Shaler Township, provided
the applicant demonstrates by competent evidence that the
communications tower or communications facility cannot be reasonably colocated
on another communications tower in a C Cemetery, GC General
Commercial, I Industrial or other zoning district inside or outside the
Township.
§ 225-72. Co-location and sharing requirements and procedures.
Communications towers and communications facilities shall be permitted
as a conditional use in the Township, provided the Board finds that no
existing or planned communications tower can reasonably accommodate
the applicant's proposed antenna or other equipment as described herein.
As a prerequisite to such finding, the applicant shall comply with the
following co-location and sharing requirements and procedures:
A. Prior to submitting a conditional use application, the applicant shall
contact the owners of all existing or planned communications towers, as
well as suitable building-mounted sites in the Township of a height
approximately equal to or greater than the height of the
communications tower proposed by the applicant located in a C
Cemetery, GC General Commercial, I Industrial or other zoning district.
A list shall be provided by the applicant to the Township of all such
owners contacted, the date of such contact, as well as the form and
content of such contact in order to obtain tower sharing.

approval so as to allow for inclusion of the responses into the
application when filed. Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be
relevant to the filing of an application if a timely, good faith effort was
made to obtain co-location or tower sharing. However, where an
existing or planned communications tower is known to have capacity
for additional antennas of the type proposed, based upon a prior
decision regarding such communications tower, a response concerning
co-location is required as a condition for approval of the conditional
use. The Township shall maintain and provide, on request, records of
responses from each owner.
C. The applicant shall request the following information for co-location
from each owner contacted:
(1) Identification of the site by location, existing uses and
communications tower height.
(2) Whether the existing or planned communications tower can
structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant
without requiring that structural changes be made to the existing
or planned communications tower.

structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural
changes are made, not including totally rebuilding the existing or
planned communications tower. If so, the owner shall specify in
general terms what structural changes would be required.
(4) If structurally able, would shared-use by such existing or planned
communications tower be precluded for reasons related to RFI. If
so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in
either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to
accommodate the proposed communications tower, if at all.
(5) If shared-use is possible, based on Subsection C(3) and (4) above,
the fee an owner of any existing or planned communications tower
would charge for such shared-use.
D. Shared-use or co-location shall not be precluded simply because a
reasonable fee for shared-use is charged or because of reasonable cost
necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared
communications tower. Expert testimony may be considered to
determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding
new communications tower construction and the cost of ground rental
or acquisition are presumed unreasonable.

Zoning Hearing Board
§ 225-179. Appointment; organization.
The Zoning Hearing Board as now constituted is hereby continued. Each
member shall serve until the expiration of his or her present term. Said
Board shall consist of three residents of the Township of Shaler appointed
by resolution by the Board of Commissioners. Members of the Hearing
Board shall hold no other elected or appointed office in the Township
nor shall any member be an employee of the Township. The members

and their terms shall be so fixed that the term of office of one member
shall expire each year. The Board shall promptly notify the Commissioners
of any vacancy which may occur. Any vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term only. The members of the Hearing Board may be removed
for malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in office by a majority vote
of the Board of Commissioners, taken after the member has received 15
days' advance notice of the intention to take such a vote. A hearing shall
be held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in
writing. The Board shall elect its officers from its own membership, who
shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves. For the
conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum shall be
not less than a majority of all members of the Board, but the Board may
appoint a hearing officer from its own membership to conduct any hearing
on its behalf. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its
procedure, consistent with ordinances of the municipality, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, and laws of the commonwealth. The Board
shall keep full public records of its business and shall submit a report of its
activities to the governing body once a year.
§ 225-180. Powers, duties and jurisdiction.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
render final adjudications in the following matters:
(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance,
except those brought before the Board of Commissioners pursuant
to Sections 609.1 and 916.1(a)(2) of the Municipalities Planning
Code.220
(2) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but
not limited to the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act
on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist
order, or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming
use, structure or lot.
220. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1 and 10916.1(a)(2), respectively.

floodplain or flood hazard ordinance221 or such provisions within a
land use ordinance.
(4) Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter, flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance
pursuant to Section 910.2 of the Municipalities Planning Code.222
In considering requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant, the Board may grant a variance, provided that the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and to the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the requested variance, if authorized, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue. In granting any
variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of the Municipalities Planning Code and this chapter.
(5) Applications for special exceptions under this chapter, floodplain or
flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance pursuant to Section 912.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code.223 In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board

may from time to time refer appeals and requests for special exceptions
and variances to the Planning Commission for recommendations and
advice.

right to proceed directly to court, where appropriate, pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 1091 (relating to action in
mandamus).
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,

and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe
that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to
his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge
of his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the
landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan
pursuant to Section 709 of the Municipalities Planning Code226 or from
an adverse decision by a Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity
of an ordinance or map pursuant to Section 916.2 of the Municipalities

is issued.

of said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of
land at least one week prior to the hearing. In the case of a request for a
special exception or variance, such notice shall also be sent by certified
mail to the registered owner of each property located within 200 feet of
the boundaries of the property which is the subject of the requested
special exception or variance.
B. The Board of Commissioners may prescribe reasonable fees with
respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said
hearings may include compensation for the secretary and members of

however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning Hearing Board,
expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical consultants

an equal number of additional hearings. Persons opposed to the
application may, upon written consent or consent on the record by the
applicant and municipality, be granted additional hearings to complete
their opposition to the application, provided the applicant is granted an
equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal.
D. The hearings shall be conducted by the Board or the Board may appoint
any member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer. The
decision or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be made
by the Board; however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may
be, in addition to the Township, may, prior to the decision of the
hearing, waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the
decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
E. The parties to the hearing shall be the municipality, any person affected

the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove
provided, the Board shall give public notice of said decision within 10
days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same
manner as provided in Subsection A of this section. If the Board shall

day following its date. To all other persons who have filed their names
and addresses with the Board, no later than the last day of the hearing
the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise a brief notice of decision
or findings and a statement of the place at which the full decision or
findings may be examined.
M. The Planning Commission, at the request of the Zoning Hearing Board,
shall furnish all pertinent narrative material, maps, charts and other
data relative to the proceedings involved for reference by all
concerned. The Zoning Hearing Board may adjourn any hearing for the
purpose of reviewing such data as may be pertinent to the problem
involved and to request interpretations of said data by a representative
of the Planning Commission.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 913.3 in the
Municipalities Planning Code230 and during its pendency before the
Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance,
order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body and all
official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition,
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.
When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant,
the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.

C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond,
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys'
fees incurred by the petitioner.

validity of this chapter or map or any provision hereof which prohibits
or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest
shall submit the challenge either:
(1) To the Zoning Hearing Board under Section 909.1(a) of the
Municipalities Planning Code243; or

another by this chapter or map or any provision hereof, who desires to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds, shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon under
Section 909.1(a)(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code.245

contain, in addition to the requirements of the written request
hereof, the plans and explanatory materials describing the use or
development proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use or
development permitted by the challenged ordinance or map. Such
plans or other explanatory materials shall not be required to meet
the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval
or for the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for
evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof.

Municipalities Planning Code.248 If a challenge heard by the Zoning
Hearing Board is found to have merit, the decision of the Zoning
Hearing Board shall include recommended amendments to the

the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;

woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features; the degree to which these are protected or

and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(6) The Board of Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the
case may be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
(7) If the Board of Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the
case may be, fails to act on the landowner's request within the time
limits referred to in Subsection C(6), a denial of the request is
deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board or Board of Commissioners, as the case may
be, shall commence its hearings within 60 days after the request is filed
unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory
material or proposed amendments, may be examined by the public.
F. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board or Board of Commissioners, as the case
may be, fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set
forth in Subsection D;
(2) The Board of Commissioners notifies the landowner that it will not
adopt the curative amendment;
(3) The Board of Commissioners adopts another curative amendment
which is unacceptable to the landowner; or

§ 225-206. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion.
In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that the ordinance or map under which he proposed to build
is free from challenge and recognizing that the procedure for preliminary
approval of his development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable,
the landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge to
the ordinance or map will run under Section 914.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code252 by the following procedure:
shall have two years from the date of such approval to file an
application for preliminary or tentative approval pursuant to Article V
or VII of the Municipalities Planning Code. Within the two-year period,
no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the
curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing
of the preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of Section 508(4)
of the Municipalities Planning Code251 shall apply. Where the proposal
appended to the curative amendment application or the validity
challenge is approved but does not require further application under
any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer shall
have one year within which to file for a building permit. Within the
one-year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in
any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicants granted
in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for
the purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
A. The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion as to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and
maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be required to meet the
standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for
the issuance of a building permit so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall
be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Township. Such notice shall include a
general description of the proposed use or development and its
location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under Section 914.1 of the

§ 225-207. Mediation option.
Municipalities Planning Code253 and the time therein specified for
commencing a proceeding with the Board shall run from the time when
the second notice thereof has been published.
A. Parties to proceedings authorized in Articles IX and X-A of the
Municipalities Planning Code may utilize mediation as an aid in
completing such proceedings. In proceedings before the Zoning
Hearing Board, in no case shall the Zoning Hearing Board initiate
mediation or participate as a mediating party. Mediation shall
supplement not replace those procedures in Articles IX and X-A once
they have been formally initiated. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as expanding or limiting municipal police powers or as
modifying any principles of substantive law.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the particulars of
each case and the willingness of the parties to negotiate. The Township
shall assure that, in each case, the mediating parties, assisted by the
mediator as appropriate, develop terms and conditions for:
(1) Funding mediation.
(2) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a working
knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision procedures and
demonstrated skills in mediation.
(3) Completing mediation, including time limits for such completion.
(4) Suspending time limits otherwise authorized in the Municipalities
Planning Code, provided that there is written consent by the
mediating parties and by an applicant or municipal decisionmaking
body if either is not a party to the mediation.
(5) Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity to
participate.
(6) Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or all of the
mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.
(7) Assuring that mediated solutions are in writing and signed by the
parties and become subject to review and approval by the
appropriate decisionmaking body pursuant to the authorized
procedures set forth in the Municipalities Planning Code.
C. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding the
final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as evidence in
any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.

ARTICLE XX
Planned Residential Development
§ 225-208. Purpose.
The purposes of this article are to:
§ 225-209. Eligibility.
No application for tentative approval of a planned residential development
shall be considered or approved unless the following conditions are met:
A. Ensure that the provisions of the Shaler Township Zoning Chapter
which are concerned with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk,
density and open space within each zoning district shall not be applied
to the improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development in a
manner which would distort the objectives of this chapter.
B. Encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that
the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type,
design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more
efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings.
C. Provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for all
who are or will be residents of the Township.
D. Encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to reflect
changes in the technology of land development so that the economies so
secured may enure to the benefit of those who need homes.
E. Encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources, such as streams, lakes, floodplains,
groundwater, wooded areas, steeply sloped areas and areas of unusual
beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem.
F. Encourage innovations in residential developments that are designed to
minimize energy consumption and maximize recycling of materials in
their layout, transportation, climate control, energy sources and solid
and liquid waste treatment systems.
G. In aid of these purposes, provide a procedure which can relate the type,
design and layout of residential development to the particular site and
the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development
in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values
within existing residential areas and to assure that the increased
flexibility of regulations over land development established hereby is
carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious and fair administrative
standards and procedures.
A. The tract proposed for a planned residential development consists of a
contiguous area of at least five acres.
§ 225-208 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-209
1:957
§ 225-210. Permitted uses.
A planned residential development may include the following uses:
§ 225-211. Development standards.
B. The development will be served by all utilities, including sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, waterlines, gas, electricity and stormwater
management, which shall be in place and capable of functioning prior to
the construction of any principal buildings within the planned
residential development or any stage thereof.
C. The proposed development is found to be generally consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan for Shaler Township.
D. The planned residential development shall be permitted as a
conditional use in all zoning districts of the Township meeting the
requirements of this article.
E. The tract of land to be developed shall be in one ownership or, if in
multiple ownership, shall be developed according to a single plan with
common authority and responsibility.
A. Residential uses, including detached, semidetached, attached (e.g.,
townhouse, multifamily) or multistoried (e.g., garden apartment,
apartment) structures or any combination thereof.
B. Commercial and institutional uses, to the extent that they are designed
and intended primarily to serve the residents of the planned residential
development.
C. Recreational uses deemed appropriate by the Board of Commissioners
for incorporation into the design of the development.
D. No-impact home-based businesses as an accessory use, subject to the
use restrictions and requirements of an R-1 Limited One-Family
District.
A. General site design and natural features analysis. A well-designed
planned residential development, integrated with existing social and
natural processes and making efficient use of common services, should
be an asset to the community. The site designer and architect, working
together, must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township Planning
Commission and Board of Commissioners that they have considered
both the opportunities provided and the constraints imposed by the
existing natural and social features, both on and off the site of the
proposed development, in determining site layout (including the
selection of areas for open space) and design of structures. In order to
determine which specific areas of the total planned residential
development site are best suited for high-density development, which
areas are best suited for lower-density development and which areas
should be preserved in their natural state or utilized as active open
§ 225-209 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:958
space areas, a thorough analysis of the natural features of the site will
be required.
(1) The following subject categories must be included in this analysis:
(a) Hydrology. Analysis of natural drainage patterns and water
resources, including an analysis of streams, natural drainage
swales, ponds or lakes, marsh areas, floodplain areas,
wetlands, permanent high-water table areas and seasonal
high-water table areas throughout the site.
(b) Geology. Analysis of characteristics of rock formations
underlying the site, including delineation of aquifers
(particularly those locally subject to pollution), shallow
bedrock areas and areas in which rock formations are
unstable.
(c) Soils. Analysis of types of soils present in the site area,
including delineation of prime agricultural soil areas, aquifer
recharge soil areas, unstable soils, soils most susceptible to
erosion and soils suitable for urban development. The analysis
of soils will be based on the Allegheny County Soil Survey
(United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service).
(d) Topography. Analysis of the site's terrain, including mapping of
contours and delineation of slope areas greater than 25%,
between 15% and 25%, between 8% and 15%, and less than
8%.
(e) Vegetation and wildlife. Analysis of tree and plant cover and
wildlife habitats of the site, emphasizing the location of
woodland and meadowland areas. Dominant tree, plant and
animal species should be identified and the characteristics of
each recognized.
(f) Microclimate. Analysis of seasonal temperatures, seasonal
precipitation, seasonal prevailing winds and daily hours of
sunlight in specific areas of the planned residential
development site.
(2) The Board of Commissioners shall require site planning to be in
accord with the results of such analysis and may require
modifications where, in its opinion, site planning has been
insufficiently attentive thereto.
B. Density and amount of open space.
(1) The maximum allowable average gross residential density for
planned residential developments shall be equal to the same
number of dwelling units per acre of land as allowed in the most
permissive zoning district in the Township, except that higher
§ 225-211 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-211
1:959
densities may be allowed in accordance with the bonus provisions
contained in this section. In no event shall the average gross
residential density exceed 1.25 times the dwelling units per acre as
allowed above.
(2) Supplemental facilities for commercial services to serve the
residents of the planned residential development and for
recreational purposes may be provided within a planned residential
development, based upon the following requirements:
(a) Recreational facilities may be located within required open
space areas; provided, however, that no building shall be
constructed within a floodplain area or within an area having a
slope greater than 25%. Ownership and maintenance shall be
in accordance with Subsection F(2) and (5) hereof.
(b) No convenience commercial facilities may be provided unless
the planned residential development shall contain a minimum
of 300 dwelling units, in which case a maximum of 3,600
square feet of gross leasable floor space may be provided. The
total of such floor space may be increased by an additional 15
square feet for each dwelling unit in excess of 300 within the
planned residential development.
(3) Not less than 25% of the gross acreage of the tract proposed for
planned residential development shall be designated and devoted
to common open space.
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance to permit that not
less than 15% of the gross acreage of the tract proposed for the
development shall be designated as and devoted to common open
space, provided that unnecessary hardship upon the applicant is
proven, and provided, further, that all other applicable
requirements of this chapter are met.
C. Density bonus. Permissible average gross residential density may be
increased, up to the maximum set forth in Subsection B(1) hereof, by
incorporation of the following features, either alone or in combination,
into the planned residential development:
(1) Additional open space. For each additional percentage point of land
in common open space above 25%, the average gross residential
density may be increased by 0.25%.
(2) Achievement of other purposes. The Board may grant a density
bonus to achieve other purposes, such as historic preservation,
outstanding site planning and design, unusual measures for
environmental enhancement, etc.
D. Design, bulk and location standards.
(1) Site design.
§ 225-211 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:960
(a) All housing shall be designed with regard to topography and
natural features of the site. The effects of prevailing winds,
seasonal temperatures and hours of sunlight on the physical
layout and form of the proposed buildings shall be taken into
account.
(b) Housing and other facilities near the periphery of the planned
residential development shall be designed so as to be
harmonious with neighboring areas.
(c) Development in environmentally sensitive areas is subject to
the following limitations:
Type of Land Limitation
Floodplain area No units permitted
Wetlands No units permitted
Slope of 25% or
more
No units permitted
Slope of 15% to
25%
Maximum total disturbance of soil by
methods, including, but not limited to,
cutting, grading, filling, bulldozing,
plowing, regrading, digging or defoliation,
shall not exceed 5% of the total area
within a 15% to 25% slope
(2) Conservation of trees and natural features.
(a) The development shall be designed and programmed so as to
minimize earthmoving, erosion, tree clearance and the
destruction of natural amenities.
(b) No portions of tree masses or trees with eight inches or
greater diameter at breast height (dbh) shall be removed
unless clearly necessary for effectuation of the proposed
development. Developers shall make all reasonable efforts to
harmonize their plans with the preservation of existing trees.
(c) When effectuation of a proposed planned residential
development necessitates the clearing of trees or portions of
tree masses, the developer shall be guided by the following
criteria in selecting trees and ornamentals of retention or
clearing:
[1] Aesthetic values (autumn coloration, types of flower and
fruit, bark and crown characteristics and amount of
dieback present).
[2] Susceptibility of tree to insect and disease attack and to
air pollution.
[3] Species longevity.
§ 225-211 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-211
1:961
[4] Wind firmness and capability of soil to hold trees.
[5] Wildlife values (e.g., oak, hickory, pine, walnut and
dogwood have high food value).
[6] Comfort to surroundings (e.g., hardwoods reduce summer
temperatures to surroundings more effectively than pines
or cedars).
[7] Existence of disease, rot or other damage to the tree.
(Trees in poor physical condition should be removed.)
[8] Protection of buildings (e.g., dead and large limbs hanging
over buildings should be removed).
[9] The size of the tree at maturity.
(d) Developers shall exercise care to protect remaining trees from
damage during construction. The following procedures shall be
utilized in order to protect remaining trees:
[1] Where existing ground levels are raised, drainage tiles
shall be placed vertically at the old soil level and tops
brought up to the surface of the ground and filled with
coarse, crushed stone or gravel. The tiles should be placed
to the perimeter of the dripline of the tree and at a
maximum of four feet apart.
[2] Trees within 25 feet of a building or bordering entrances
or exits to building sites shall be protected by a temporary
barrier.
[3] No boards or other material shall be nailed to trees during
construction.
[4] Heavy equipment operators shall be warned to avoid
damaging existing tree trunks and roots. Roots shall not be
cut closer than the tree's dripline.
[5] Tree trunks and exposed roots damaged during
construction shall be protected from further damage by
being treated immediately with professional procedures.
[6] Tree limbs damaged during construction shall be sawed
flush to tree trunks and treated immediately with tree
paint.
[7] The operation of heavy equipment over root systems of
such trees shall be minimized in order to prevent soil
compaction.
[8] Nondormant trees shall be given a heavy application of
fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible damage
caused by construction operations.
§ 225-211 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:962
[9] Construction debris shall not be disposed of around or
near the bases of such trees except for mulched vegetative
matter used to prevent soil compaction.
(e) Trees with a minimum diameter at breast height of two inches
shall be provided by the developer where deemed necessary by
the Board to mitigate the loss of existing trees. Unless clearly
unfeasible, native species shall be utilized.
(3) Area spacing and yard requirements. The front yard depth; rear
yard depth; side yard width, each side; and side yard width
abutting street of all dwelling units and other structures in a
planned residential development shall not exceed the requirements
of the R-5 Zoning District.
(4) Height regulations. No structure shall exceed the maximum height
requirements of the R-5 Zoning District.
(5) Street and walkways.
(a) The design, dimensions and construction of all streets shall
comply with applicable standards in the Shaler Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.254 Where the
Board finds that the purposes of this chapter will be better
served, however, it may modify the terms of the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance, provided that a comparable
level of performance will be achieved.
(b) The street and walkway systems shall be designed so as to
relate harmoniously with land uses and adjacent streets and to
minimize through traffic in residential areas. All residential
parking and recreational areas shall be connected by
pedestrian walkways. Walkways that connect residential areas
and parking areas shall be of a durable, all-weather surface
satisfactory to the Board.
(c) Separation of vehicular from pedestrian and bicycle traffic is
encouraged. Where pedestrian walkways are not within a
street right-of-way, a walkway easement at least 10 feet in
width shall be designated. Where a walkway crosses over open
space land, however, the easement shall not be subtracted
from the open space land for purposes of calculating the area
thereof.
(d) Where dwelling units front on a perimeter collector street, no
direct vehicular access from the lot or tract to the collector
street shall be permitted.
254. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision of Land.
§ 225-211 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-211
1:963
(6) Parking. All planned residential developments shall have the
minimum number of off-street parking spaces for each dwelling
unit and structure as set forth in this chapter.
(7) Lighting.
(a) All common parking areas, steps, ramps, walkways of high
pedestrian use and directional signs shall be adequately
lighted.
(b) The Board may require lighting in other areas for reasons of
public safety.
(c) All above-required lighting and all external lighting fixtures
appurtenant to a structure shall be shielded from all
residential properties and from all rights-of-way so as to
eliminate light glare beyond an angle of 35° from a vertical
plane. No such lighting shall violate the applicable standards
set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
(8) Stormwater management. All requirements of the Shaler Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance,255 if any exists, shall be
applicable to a planned residential development.
(9) Landscaping and buffers.
(a) All common parking areas shall be landscaped with trees and
shrubs of varying species. At least one shade tree of minimum
diameter at breast height of two inches and height of six feet
on each side of the street shall be provided within the interior
of each parking area for every five parking spaces.
(b) Shade trees of varying species shall be planted along all streets
outside the street right-of-way. At least one tree of minimum
diameter at breast height of two inches and height of six feet
on each side of the street shall be provided for each 25 feet of
street length or fraction thereof.
(c) The Board shall require that, along the entire perimeter of the
tract proposed for a planned residential development or
identified segments thereof, a planting strip be installed that
adequately meets the following criteria:
[1] All existing trees two inches or more in diameter at breast
height and/or six feet or more in height shall be preserved,
except when cutting thereof is specifically approved by the
Board or is necessary for ensuring adequate sight
distance.
[2] The amount, density and types of planting shall be based
upon physiographic features, feasibility of using native
255. Editor's Note: See Ch. 190, Stormwater Management.
§ 225-211 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:964
species, proximity to existing dwellings, compatibility of
adjacent uses and natural views. Where adjacent property
has been developed in such a manner that privacy from the
planned residential development is desirable, the planting
strip adjacent thereto shall be of sufficient density and
contain sufficient evergreen material to effectively screen
the portions of the planned residential development from
which privacy is desired. In other areas, particularly where
the physiographic features and existing vegetation provide
an attractive setting, the planting strip may be left in its
natural state or enhanced with additional plant material of
lesser density than a full screen.
[3] No planting shall be placed with its center closer than five
feet from a property line of the tract.
[4] Plantings shall be permanently maintained and, if
necessary to maintain an effective screen, replaced in the
event that they become diseased or dead.
[5] Planting species shall be mixed; generally, a minimum of
25% shall be evergreen and 10% flowering material.
(d) In addition to perimeter planting strips, the following
landscaping requirements shall be met:
[1] Disturbed topsoil shall be stockpiled, protected from
erosion and replaced after construction.
[2] Planting and protection of landscape material shall be in
accordance with a plan and schedule prepared by a
registered landscape architect and shall be completed
within six months of initial occupancy of each stage of
development. Maintenance precautions for all plant
materials shall be submitted with the final plan.
(10) Signs. All outdoor signs shall be in conformity with the provisions
of Article VIII, Signs, of this chapter, and with the most restrictive
zoning district in which the planned residential development is
located.
(11) Supplemental nonresidential facilities. All convenience commercial
facilities shall comply with the following standards:
(a) Locations shall be such as not to interfere with the adjacent
residential uses. Architectural compatibility with residential
structures to be erected within the planned residential
development shall be maximized.
(b) Freestanding or lighted signs are prohibited. All such signs
shall be attached to an exterior wall (not roof) of the structure
§ 225-211 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-211
1:965
and may be mounted either flush thereto or at right angles
thereto.
(c) Any parcel on which such facilities are located shall be
bounded by a buffer strip on all property lines abutting
residential uses. Such buffer strips shall be so designed that a
vegetative screen of installed and/or existing plant materials
provides, to the satisfaction of the Board, a barrier to visibility,
airborne particles, glare and noise.
(d) Refuse stations must be designed and screened, be in locations
convenient for collection and removal, and not be offensive or
visible to the occupants of adjacent residential uses.
(e) Buildings designed or intended to be used, in part or in whole,
for commercial purposes shall not be occupied or used as such
prior to the completion of and the issuance of occupancy
permits for at least 50% of the dwelling units proposed in the
plan.
(12) Sanitary sewers. All planned residential developments shall be
connected to a public sanitary sewer system.
(13)Water supply. All planned residential developments shall be
provided with a complete public water distribution system. The
design and installation of such public system shall be subject to the
approval of the Township.
(14) Other utilities.
(a) All other utility lines, including, but not limited to, electric, gas,
streetlight supply, cable television and telephone, shall be
placed underground. Installation of all utilities shall be in strict
accordance with the construction standards and specifications
of the Township, Municipal Authority or other public utility
concerned. All such underground utilities shall be put in place,
connected and approved before the streets are constructed,
where such utilities lie under the proposed cartway, and before
any person is permitted to occupy any building to be served by
such utilities.
(b) In accordance with the provisions of Act 170 of 1988,256 the
developer will contact all applicable utilities and accurately
determine the locations and depths of all underground utilities
within the boundaries of the tract proposed for development
prior to excavation. A list of the applicable utilities and their
phone numbers shall appear on the plans submitted for review,
and proof of contact shall be presented to the Township prior
to final plan approval.

§ 225-211 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:966
E. Development in stages. A developer may construct a planned
residential development in stages if the following criteria are met:
(1) The application for tentative approval covers the entire planned
residential development and shows the location and approximate
time of construction for each stage, in addition to other information
required by this chapter.
(2) At least 25% of the dwelling units in the plan given tentative
approval shall be included in all but the final stage.
(3) The second and subsequent stages are completed consistent with
the tentatively approved plan and are of such size and location,
including a sufficient degree of completion of the road network and
other infrastructure, that they constitute economically sound units
of development.
(4) Each phase shall include common open space in amounts and at
locations deemed acceptable by the Board to meet, at minimum,
the open space needs generated by that phase and to assure
protection of the sensitive features of the tract.
(5) Gross residential density may be varied from stage to stage,
provided that final approval shall not be given to any stage if the
gross residential density of the area which includes stages already
finally approved and the stage for which final approval is being
sought exceeds by more than 20% the gross residential density
allowed for the entire planned residential development in the
tentatively approved plan.
F. Standards for common open space.
(1) Amount. Not less than 25% of the total tract proposed for planned
residential development shall be designated as and used
exclusively for common open space.
(2) Ownership. Any of the following methods may be used, either
individually or together, to preserve, own and maintain common
open space: condominium, homeowners' association, dedication in
fee simple, dedication of easements and transfer of fee simple title

(5) Maintenance.
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space or any successor organization
shall at any time after establishment of the planned residential
development fail to maintain the common open space in
§ 225-211 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-211
1:971
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the
planned residential development, setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon, which shall be held within 14 days of the notice.
At such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof
shall not be corrected within said 30 days or any extension
thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the taxable values
of the properties within the planned residential development
and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not constitute a taking of said common open
space and shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space except when the same is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the residents and owners and such
dedication is acceptable to the Township. Before the expiration
of said year, the Township shall, upon its initiative or upon
the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing
upon notice to such organization or the residents and owners
of the planned residential development, to be held by the
Township, at which hearing such organization or the residents
and owners of the planned residential development shall show
cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the
election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If
the Township shall determine that such organization is ready
and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease to maintain said common
open space at the end of said year. If the Township shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the
Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said
common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township in any case shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial
review.
(b) The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by
the Township shall be assessed ratably against the properties
within the planned residential development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a lien
§ 225-211 SHALER CODE § 225-211
1:972
§ 225-212. Contents of application.
on said properties. Said assessments or charges shall be
subordinate in lien to the lien of any prior mortgage or
mortgages on the property which is subject to such
assessments or charges. The Township, at the time of entering
upon such said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of
the Prothonotary of the County upon the properties affected by
such lien within the planned residential development.
G. Enforcement of plan provisions. In accordance with Section 706 of Act
170,258 the provisions of the development plan relating to the use, bulk
and location of buildings and structures; the quantity and location of
common open space; and the intensity of use or the density of
residential units shall run in favor of the Township and shall be
enforceable in law or in equity by the Township, without limitation on
any powers of regulation otherwise granted the Township by law. The
development plan shall specify those of its provisions which shall run in
favor of and be enforceable by residents of the planned residential
development and, in addition, the manner in which such residents may
modify or release such rights.
