§ 43-13. Administration.
The Police Pension Fund shall be administered by the Supervisors of the
Township of Brighton or such person or persons as the Supervisors may
designate from time to time.
A. The Police Pension Fund established by § 43-9 hereof shall be
maintained as follows:
(1) By a monthly charge on or against the salaries of each member of
the Township police force of an amount equal to not less than 5%
nor more than 8%, which charge is hereby made, beginning with all
salaries for the month of September 1968.
(2) By gifts, grants, devises or bequests granted to the Police Pension

§ 43-14. Retirement age. [Added 4-13-2020 by Res. No. 2020-1111]
§ 43-15. Credit for military service.
Any member of the police force employed by the Township of Brighton,
who has been a regularly appointed employee of the Township of Brighton
for a period of at least six months and who thereafter shall enter into the
military service of the United States, shall have credited to his employment
record for pension or retirement benefits all of the time spent by him in such
military service, if such person returns to his employment within six months
after his separation from the service.
A. Normal retirement. The Township of Brighton hereby prescribes
normal retirement age to be a minimum of total service in the
aggregate of 25 years in the Township of Brighton and a minimum age
of 55 years after which members of the police force of the Township of
Brighton may retire from active duty. Such members who are retired
shall be subject to service, from time to time, as a police reserve, in case
of riot, tumult or preservation of the public peace until unfit for such
service, when they may be finally discharged by reason of age or
disability.
B. Early retirement. The Township of Brighton hereby prescribes early
retirement age to be a minimum of total service in the aggregate of 20
years in the Township of Brighton, after which members of the police
force of the Township of Brighton may retire and receive an early
retirement benefit in an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the
accrued benefits as of the date the employment terminates. The
actuarial equivalent shall be a reduction in benefits to reflect early
commencement prior to normal retirement. Selection of an early
retirement benefit must be made on or before July 31, 2020. Thereafter,
the early retirement benefit is not available.
C. Vesting without normal or early retirement. Should any member of the
police force, before completing superannuation retirement age and
service requirements but after having completed 12 years of total
service, for any reason, cease to be employed as a full-time police
officer by the Township of Brighton, he shall be entitled to vest his
retirement benefits by filing with the Township of Brighton within 90
days of the date he ceases to be a full-time police officer a written notice
of his intention to vest. Upon reaching the date which would have been
his superannuation retirement date, if he had continued to be employed
as a full-time police officer, he shall be paid a partial superannuation
retirement allowance determined by applying the percentage his years
of service bears to the years of service which he would have rendered
had he continued to work until his superannuation retirement date to
the gross pension, using, however, the monthly average salary during
the appropriate thirty-six-month period prior to his termination of
employment.

§ 43-16. Payment of pensions.
Payments to be made by the Police Pension Fund herein established shall
not be a charge on any other fund in the Treasury of the Township of
Brighton or under its control, save the Police Pension Fund herein provided
for. The basis for determining any pension payable hereunder following
retirement of any member of the force meeting the service and age
qualifications of this article shall be as follows:
A. Monthly pension or retirement benefits shall be 1/2 the monthly
average salary (which for the purpose of this calculation shall include
only base salary, overtime pay and longevity pay) of such member
during the last 36 months of employment. Such pension or retirement
benefits for any month shall be computed as the sum of any pension
benefits from pension plans or association for the members of the police
force, but only to the extent that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or
the Township of Brighton shall have contributed to such pension plan
moneys raised by taxation, and benefits from the Police Pension Fund
established pursuant to resolution of the Township of Brighton to the
extent necessary to bring the total benefits in any month up to 1/2 the
aforesaid monthly average salary. [Amended 6-14-2004 by Res. No.
04-14]
B. All full-time police officers in the employ of the Township of Brighton as
of December 31, 1992, shall, following receipt of retirement benefits, be
entitled to a cost of living increase; provided, however, that such cost of
living increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price Index from the year in which the police member last
worked, and provided, further, that in no case shall the total police
pension benefits exceed 65% of the salary for computing retirement
benefits, and provided, further, that the total cost of living increase
shall not exceed 30%. No cost of living increase shall be granted which
would impair the actuarial soundness of the pension fund.
C. Maximum benefit. [Added 12-11-1995]
(1) In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the Police
Pension Fund, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Police Pension Fund to the contrary, for years beginning on or after
January 1, 1994, the annual compensation of each employee taken
into account under the Police Pension Fund shall not exceed the
OBRA '93 annual compensation limit. The OBRA '93 compensation
limit is $150,000, as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in
the cost-of-living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a
calendar year applied to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over
which compensation is determined (determination period)
beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists
of fewer than 12 months, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit
will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

§ 43-17. Permanently disabled officers. [Amended 6-14-2004 by Res.
No. 04-14]
If prior to retirement a police officer becomes totally and permanently
disabled while engaged in the performance of his duties as a police officer
so as to render him incapable of continuing his usual and customary
employment with the Township, and such condition continues for a period
of six consecutive months, and by reason thereof such police officer's
employment ceases, then such disabled police officer shall be entitled to
receive disability benefits equal to 50% of his average monthly salary at
the time of his disability, offset by any benefits payable under the Social
Security Act because of the same injuries. Such benefits shall continue
until the cessation of the disability or the death of the police officer. Such
disability benefit payments shall be reduced by any statutory benefits that
are awarded to the disabled police officer and by any benefits that are paid
pursuant to any disability insurance and any other compensation provided
by the Township.

denominator of which is 12.
(2) For years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, any reference in
this Police Pension Fund to the limitation under Section 401(1)(17)
of the Code shall mean the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit set
forth in this provision.
(3) If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into
account in determining an employee's benefits accruing in the
current year, the compensation for that prior determination period
is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit in effect for
that prior determination period. For this purpose, for
determination periods beginning before the first day of the first
year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual
compensation limit is $150,000.
(4) Effective January 1, 1989, no police officer's annual benefit under
the Police Pension Fund and all other defined benefit plans
sponsored by the Township of Brighton may be greater than the
maximum amount calculated under Section 415 of the Internal
Revenue Code and the provisions of Section 415(b)(2)(F) of the
Internal Revenue Code that are specifically applicable to plans
maintained by governments and tax exempt organizations.
A. The surviving spouse of a police officer who has met the age and service
requirements for normal retirement as provided in § 43-14 of this
article, and who dies while still employed by the Township as an active
full-time police officer, shall receive 50% of the monthly accrued
pension benefit the police officer would have received had the officer

article shall be entitled to receive monthly benefits at the rate of 50% of

receiving at the time of his death. Upon the death of the surviving
spouse, or in the absence of a surviving spouse, any surviving child or
children of the deceased police officer under the age of 18 shall be

§ 79-1. Legislative intent.
The County of Beaver, Pennsylvania, of which the Township of Brighton is
a municipal subdivision, has implemented an emergency telephone system
whereby an individual can dial a 911 telephone number in the event of
an emergency. A Township-wide uniform numbering system of all buildings
will assist emergency personnel in responding efficiently and quickly to an
emergency. It is, therefore, in the best interests of the public health, safety
and welfare of the residents of Brighton Township to establish a uniform
numbering system.
§ 79-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
HOUSE NUMBER  The number which has been legally assigned to a
residence, apartment building or business by the Township of Brighton for
the purpose of identification and for use by the United States Postal Service
for the delivery of mail.[Amended 11-9-2009 by Ord. No. 165]

shall be in standard Arabic numerals, not less than three inches in
height, and shall be reflective for greater nighttime visibility.
C. If, for any reason, the house number of a particular building is not

been numbered in accordance with these regulations of the violation
and need to comply.

regulations despite notices to do so, the Supervisors may issue a
written order directing the owners, occupants or others in possession of
the buildings or property which is in violation of this chapter to comply

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 100-17. Identification.
§ 100-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Brighton Township classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated August
17, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Brighton Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless the appropriate permit is obtained from
the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
(2) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
§ 100-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 100-18
1:89
§ 100-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, soon as practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify
FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
(a) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(b) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined.
[1] No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use, or activity within any AE Area/District
without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE at any point.
[2] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
B. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
§ 100-18 BRIGHTON CODE § 100-19
1:90
technical or scientific data. See § 100-22B for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 100-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by Brighton Township, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board of
Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 100-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

days after the date of the permit and shall be completed within 12 months
after the date of issuance of the permit, unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the floodplain administrator. The "actual start" means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such
as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
SUBDIVISION  The division or redivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of
land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions
of land, including changes in existing lot lines, for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs
or devisees, transfer of ownership, or building or lot development, provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a

condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start
of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.

adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the Code adopted the International
Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
reference, as the construction standards applicable with the state floodplain
construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VARIANCE  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A

professional shall provide a statement and certification that it is his
professional opinion that the proposed slope will have sufficient
stability and that the construction will not result in injury to persons,
adjacent property, utilities, streets, alleys, or structures or, when
complete and stabilized, be subject to accelerated erosion. The report
shall include specific findings and recommendations including, but not
limited to, core boring methods of construction, benching, minimum
compaction rates, surface and subsurface drainage and erosion control
measures. During construction, the geotechnical engineer shall be
required to conduct site inspections, conduct or observe compaction
tests, and otherwise attempt to ensure that the construction is
proceeding in accordance with his/her recommendations and good
engineering and construction practices. At the conclusion of
construction, and prior to release of the bond or financial security
provided in connection with the permit, the geotechnical engineer shall
provide a written report including compaction test results and a signed
and sealed certification stating that he has inspected the construction
of the fill slope(s) and that it is his professional opinion that the slope(s)
was/were constructed in accordance with his recommendations and
sound engineering and construction practices.

§ 104-9. Expiration of permit; extension.
§ 104-10. Permit and fees.
Before issuing a grading permit, the grading administrator shall collect a
permit fee from the applicant in accordance with the following provisions:
A. Where due to special circumstances and conditions, compliance with
the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship, the
grading administrator may make reasonable exceptions thereto, upon
recommendation from the Township Engineer, as will not be contrary to
the public interest, and may impose such conditions as it deems
necessary to adequately protect the public interest.
A. Unless otherwise provided by Pennsylvania law, every grading permit
shall automatically expire and become null and void if the work
authorized by such permit has not been commenced with six months or
is not completed within one year from the date of issue, provided that
the grading administrator may, if the permit holder presents
satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work
being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a
reasonable extension of time. The applicant must file an application for
an extension of time before the date of expiration of the grading permit.
B. Any physical changes from the original plan uncovered on the site
during construction, such as surface water drainage, soil and bedrock
dislocations, alteration of groundwater discharge, or any other natural
or man-made modification which would tend to adversely affect the
basis upon which the permit was issued, must be immediately reported
to the grading administrator by the permit holder. If the circumstances
dictate, the grading administrator shall revoke the permit or otherwise
modify the conditions upon which the permit was initially issued.
C. Where, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the work as proposed
by the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person or any
street or alley or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall
be denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to
endanger properties or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions,
the Township Engineer shall give due consideration to: possible
saturation by rains; earth movements; runoff surface waters; and
subsurface conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock
aquifers, springs, and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
A. Application fees and deposits. The Board of Supervisors shall establish
from time to time, by resolution, fees and deposits to be paid by the
applicant at the time of filing the relevant application under this
chapter.
B. Posting of security. Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant
shall post all necessary security in accordance with the requirements
set forth in § 104-11 of this chapter.

C. Review fees and expenses. The applicant shall reimburse the Township
for all fees and expenses incurred by the Township related to an
application and/or grading permit under this chapter, including, but not
limited to, the reasonable and necessary charges of the Township's
professional consultants, the Township Engineer, and the Township
Solicitor for review and report on an application and/or grading permit
under this chapter and the inspection of improvements and/or work
related thereto.
D. Upon filing an application, the applicant must agree, in writing, to pay
costs actually incurred by the Township, regardless of whether the
work related thereto is ever initiated or completed.
E. An administrative fee of 5% on all services provided to the Township by
professional consultants shall be deducted from the deposit as invoices
are received. Any professional consultants' fees shall be deducted from
the deposit as invoices are received.
A. As a condition of grading permit approval for projects having an
estimated cost of $25,000 or more, the applicant shall post security
acceptable to the Township in the amount of 110% of the estimated cost
to perform the grading and remedial work. The cost estimate shall
include the complete scope of work needed to be performed by the
applicant to comply with this chapter and shall be determined by the
Township Engineer.
B. As a condition of grading permit approval for projects having an
estimated cost to perform the work of less than $25,000, security in the
amount of 50% of the cost estimate as determined by the Township
Engineer shall be provided.
C. No security shall be required if security is posted for construction and/
or site improvements which already covers the cost of grading and
other control facilities.
A. The grading administrator may attach conditions to a grading permit as
reasonably necessary to prevent danger to property, including any
sewer, street, storm drain, or watercourse, or to prevent work from
being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property, or in a
manner likely to create a nuisance. No grading permit shall be issued
until all necessary plans and a cost estimate are approved by the
Township Engineer and the applicant certifies that all work shall be
performed pursuant to the approved plans, specifications, and
schedule.

§ 104-13. Inspections.
B. If the application conforms substantially to the requirements of this
chapter, the grading administrator shall approve the application and
issue a grading permit to the applicant without unreasonable delay.
C. After the actual work begins, the grading administrator or the Township
Engineer may require additional or revised controls from time to time
in the event the grading administrator and/or Township Engineer
determines that the originally approved controls are inadequate.
D. Permits issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility of securing any and all necessary permits and
approvals as required by any other applicable code, ordinance, or
regulatory agency.
A. The grading administrator and/or Township Engineer shall make the
inspections required under this chapter. Following inspection, the
grading administrator shall approve any portion of the work that has
been completed and notify the permit holder of any portion of the work
that fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. Where it is found
by inspection that the soil or other conditions are not stated or shown in
the application, the grading administrator may refuse to approve
further work and stop work on the site immediately until the Township
approves a revised grading plan conforming to existing conditions.
B. All plans for grading work bearing the approval of the Township
Engineer shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the
grading work and until the work has been approved.
C. The permit holder shall notify the grading administrator in order to
obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at
least 48 hours before the inspection is to be made. Before calling for
any inspection, the owner shall have the property line stakes set and
sufficient grade stakes set by a professional engineer or surveyor to
enable the grading administrator to verify the grading operation.
(1) Initial inspection: when work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.
(2) Rough grading: when all rough grading has been completed.
(3) Drainage facilities: when drainage facilities that connect to or shall
become public facilities are to be installed and inspected before
such facilities are backfilled.
(4) Special structures: when excavations are complete for retaining
and other structural supporting walls (e.g., crib walls) and when
reinforcing steel is in place and before concrete is poured.
(5) Final inspection: when all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures, has been completed.

The following general working conditions will apply to all grading sites.
A. Whenever the grading administrator determines that any existing
excavation, retaining wall, embankment, or fill has become a hazard,
the owner of the property upon which the excavation, retaining wall,
embankment, or fill is located, or another person or agent in control of
said property shall, upon receipt of notice, in writing, from the grading
administrator and within the reasonable period specified therein,
repair, reconstruct, or remove such excavation, retaining wall,
embankment, or fill so as to eliminate the hazard. In addition, the
Township may require as a condition of allowing the work to be done
that reasonable safety precautions be taken as the grading
administrator considers advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger.
Safety precautions may include but shall not be limited to specifying a
flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, temporary safety fencing, terracing, compaction, or cribbing.
B. If, after such notification, the property owner or other person has not
made the necessary repairs within the time requested, then the
Township may make the required repairs and the cost thereof shall be
borne by the property owner by a lien or judgment obtained as provided
by law.
A. Dust control. During grading operations, excavating, stockpiling, filling
and at dump sites, waste areas and off-site spoil areas and off-site
borrow areas, necessary measures for dust control shall be exercised,
which shall include spraying of water, both temporary and permanent,
seeding, mulching, and fertilizing of areas, or the application of other
dust-control agents.
B. Maintenance. During any grading operations, excavating, stockpiling,
filling and at dump sites, waste areas, and off-site spoil areas and offsite
borrow areas, should none of the above-mentioned work be
performed within any six-month period of time, the permittee shall be
responsible to seed, mulch, and fertilize all disturbed areas so as to
establish venation and prevent problems with dust control and to
reduce erosion and sedimentation from occurring.
C. Cleanup. All soil washed or carried onto public streets during grading
operation shall be cleaned up each day. Temporary driveway or road
surfaces shall be provided as soon as possible. The owner of the
property being graded shall be responsible to protect and clean up
lower properties of silt and debris which have washed down onto the
lower properties as a result of the grading work on the higher property
and to restore the property to original condition.
§ 104-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 104-15
1:125
§ 104-16. Standards for excavations.
Standards for excavations shall be as follows:
D. Permit hours. The operation of heavy construction or excavation
machinery, including but not limited to bulldozers, high lifts, backhoes,
trucks, power shovels, pump and jackhammers, and the operation of
equipment, such as saws and drills or any other type of machinery used
outside of a structure, in conjunction with work requiring a building
permit, which causes a noise sufficient to disturb the peace and general
tranquility of the general public or any portion thereof, shall be
prohibited in the entire Township between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m., Monday through Saturday, and all day Sunday and on
holidays.
E. PA One Call. The permittee shall place and keep current a Pennsylvania
One Call telephone number for the work being performed at any time
during the permittee work. The One Call serial number shall be kept at
the work site so that it may be verified by the grading administrator.
F. Burning. The burning of grass areas, brush piles or any other
vegetation or material for the purpose of clearing land shall be
prohibited.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be three horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazards. However, upon a
determination by a governmental review agency or a registered
professional engineer that the properties of the types of soil on the site
to be graded, as identified by the soil survey, other standard surveys,
geological surveys, or core borings, require special consideration, then
maximum slopes may then be determined as follows:
(1) Landslide-prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing
slopes are less than 25% shall have proposed cut slopes no steeper
than that are recommended by a registered professional engineer.
A document signed and sealed by said engineer shall be forwarded
to the Township prior to approval of the grading permit. Soil survey
map symbols for landslide-prone soils are:
(a) UGD Urban Land. Guernsey Complex, gently sloping 0% - 8%
slope.
(b) UGD Urban Land. Guernsey Complex, moderately sloping 8% -
25% slope.
B. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a grading permit, provided one or both of the following is
satisfied:
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for
recognized soils conditions on the site. A written statement
§ 104-15 BRIGHTON CODE § 104-16
1:126
§ 104-17. Standards for fills.
Standards for fills shall be as follows:
supported by a geotechnical investigation report, signed and
sealed by a registered professional engineer, stating that the
steeper slope will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating
a hazard will be slight, must be submitted to the grading
administrator.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support designed, signed, and
sealed by a professional engineer and approved by the grading
administrator is provided to support the face of excavation.
C. The bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back a minimum of six feet
from adjacent property lines, except for side property lines and street
right-of-way lines, in which case the distance shall be a minimum of
three feet, in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for location
of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
D. Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making the
excavation shall notify, in writing, the owners of the adjacent property
or buildings not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made
that the proposed excavation is to be started. Copies of all such notices
shall be supplied to the grading administrator.
E. The grading administrator may require an excavation to be made with a
cut slope flatter than those specified above if he finds the material in
which the excavation is to be made is unusually subject to erosion, or if
other conditions exist which, under applicable engineering practice,
make such flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation, or structure shall not
extend below the minimum angle of repose or natural slope of the soil
under the nearest point of same unless such footing, foundations, or
structure is first properly underpinned or otherwise protected against
settlement.
F. All excavations shall have a ten-foot-wide bench every 20 feet in
elevation. This bench shall be placed in order to prevent loose rock and
soil from moving down the cut slope and to control rainfall runoff. The
bench shall be sloped so that rainfall runoff is collected and conveyed
safely off the slope so that there is no rainfall runoff being conveyed
down the slope from one bench to another. At the top of the slope a
drainage swale shall be graded so as to prevent the flow of rainfall
runoff from being conveyed down the cut slope.
A. No fill shall be made in the Township which creates a slope steeper than
three horizontal to one vertical. However, the grading administrator, on
the advice and recommendation of a registered professional engineer,
§ 104-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 104-17
1:127
may impose conditions requiring that a fill be constructed with an
exposed surface flatter than three horizontal to one vertical if the
professional engineer states that under the particular circumstances
involved, such flatter surface is necessary for stability and for the safety
of persons and property.
B. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time as
determined by the Township Engineer and specified on the grading
permit.
(2) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill, including all embankments, planting areas, and
seeding areas, to a minimum depth of six inches, to effectively
conceal all materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth.
Prior to spreading topsoil, the subgrade shall be scarified to a
depth of two inches to facilitate the bonding of the subsoil with the
topsoil. If the filing operation is intermittent, the Township
Engineer may require that the top and exposed surfaces of the fill
be so covered at the completion of each lift.
(3) No fill of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps, or
other material that would create a nuisance, potential fire hazard,
or sanitary problem such as decomposition that would attract
rodents, termites, or other pests.
(4) Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material determined by the
grading administrator that could prevent proper compaction and
stability.
C. Where fills are located so that earth movement may result in personal
injury or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys, or buildings, the
bearing value and stability of the material under proposed fills and
embankments shall be determined by subsurface investigation
performed by a professional engineer.
D. Rock may be incorporated into fills and embankments but only in
maximum layers 24 inches thick, as per the latest edition of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Specifications
Publication 408, with voids filled and a blanket of compacted fill
separating one layer of rock from the next. Rock fill shall not be placed
near the bottom of foundations, building caissons, or subsurface utility
installations. Suitable earth shall be reserved or provided to cover rock
fill under proposed seeded or planted areas.
E. No unsuitable material (including but not limited to the following: coal,
bony, red-dog, expansive shale cinders, wood, or soil waste
decomposable material) shall be placed in fill areas.
§ 104-17 BRIGHTON CODE § 104-17
1:128
F. On major fills or embankments, a toe bench shall be located and
constructed below the mantle and under the toe of the embankment. A
porous drain and a discharge pipe shall be installed on the bottom and
the back wall of the toe bench.
G. All fills and embankments shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the latest edition of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Specifications Publication 408 and any
special provisions as specified by a registered professional engineer.
H. The bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back a minimum of six feet
from adjacent property lines, except for side property lines and street
right-of-way lines, in which case the distance shall be a minimum of
three feet, in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for location
of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
I. Pursuant to a determination by the grading administrator, if the nature
of a fill or embankment so warrants, a compaction test shall be required
at the end of each eight-inch lift, prior to the start of the next lift of
material. The grading administrator may require the applicant to
provide certifications of compliance with the recommendations of the
geotechnical report for placement of fill by the applicant's third-party
geotechnical consultants prior to release of performance security.
J. All fills shall have a ten-foot-wide bench every 20 feet in elevation. This
bench shall be placed in order to prevent loose rock and soil from
moving down the cut slope to control rainfall runoff. The bench shall be
sloped so that rainfall runoff is collected and conveyed safely off the
slope so that there is no rainfall being conveyed down the slope from
one bench to another. At the top of the slope a drainage swale shall be
graded so as to prevent the flow rainfall runoff from being conveyed
down the cut slope;
K. Within any identified floodplain area, fill, if used, shall:
(1) Extend laterally at least 15 feet beyond the building line from all
points.
(2) Consist of soil or small rock materials only. Sanitary landfills shall
not be permitted.
(3) Be compacted to provide the necessary permeability and resistance
to erosion, scouring, or settling.
(4) Be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, unless
substantiated data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to and
approved by the Township Engineer.
(5) Be used only to the extent that it does not adversely affect adjacent
properties.

1:129
§ 104-18. Standards for retaining walls.
Standards for retaining walls shall be as follows:
A. When the topography and natural condition of the property is such that
a ground slope of three horizontal to one vertical is not feasible, the
grading administrator may consider the submission of a grading plan
showing a retaining wall and ground slope combination that would be
aesthetically acceptable, provided the following conditions are met.
(1) If the plan incorporates terracing, the gradient of the slope
between retaining walls shall not exceed three horizontal to one
vertical, and the horizontal distance between walls shall be at least
equal to the height of the retaining wall.
(2) Where a stable natural rock ledge is existing, as established by a
written statement from a registered professional engineer, a
similar design of rock ledge and ground slope combination may be
considered by the grading administrator.
B. When a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy the requirements of this
chapter and all other applicable codes (including, but not limited to, the
Township Zoning and Building Codes29), a building permit will not be
required in addition to the grading permit.
C. Retaining walls must be designed and constructed in accordance with
sound engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall
include a description of proposed backfilling and subterranean
drainage facilities and bear the seal of a professional engineer.
D. Specifically, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical
face of the wall shall be set back a minimum of six feet from adjacent
property lines, except for side property lines and street right-of-way
lines, in which case the distance shall be a minimum of three feet. An
exception to this requirement may be granted by the grading
administrator upon an application satisfactory demonstrating that such
an exception is necessary to permit normal use of the property, that is,
for a sideline driveway, or other reasonable consideration.
E. Guide rails or protective fencing that meets the requirements of the
Township Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 195, are required to be installed
where retaining wall heights are four feet and higher.
F. High walls. A high-wall condition shall be defined to any side of an
excavation in which the temporary or permanent slope of the
excavation exceeds the slope of 1:1. Should a high wall be present
exceeding five feet measured from the bottom of the excavation to the
top of the excavation, the permittee shall be required to place a
protective fence of at least four feet in height at the top of the high wall
at a distance of no less than five feet measured horizontally from the top

furnished with a certificate pursuant to Subsection B of this section and
unless there is compliance with the procedures set forth in Subsections
C and D of this section.
B. Certificate.
(1) The Township Treasurer shall, upon the written request of the
named insured specifying the tax description of the property, name
and address of the insurance company, association or exchange,
and the date agreed upon by the insurance company, association or
exchange and the named insured as the date of the receipt of a loss
report of the claim, furnish the insurance company, association or
exchange either of the following within 14 working days of the
request:
(a) A certificate or, at the discretion of the municipality, a verbal
notification which shall be confirmed in writing by the insured,
to the effect that, as of the date specified in the request, there
are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property and that, as of the date of the
Treasurer's certificate or verbal notification, the Township has
not certified any amount as total costs incurred by the
Township for the removal, repair or securing of a building or
other structure on the property; or
(b) A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property

subsection, the Township shall certify to the Treasurer the total
§ 142-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-1
1:165
amount, if any, of such costs. A tax, assessment, penalty or user
charge becomes delinquent at the time and on the date a lien
could otherwise have been filed against the property by the
municipality under applicable law.
(2) Upon receipt of certificate.
(a) Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to Subsection B(1)(a)
of this section, the insurance company, association or exchange
shall pay the claim of the named insured in accordance with
the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the named
insured and the company, association or exchange equals or
exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
policies covering the building or other structure. In the case of
such a loss, the insurance company, association or exchange,
the insured property owner and the Township shall follow the
procedures set forth in Subsections C and D of this section.
(b) Upon the receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to
Subsection B(1)(b) of this section, the insurance company,

association or exchange equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits
of liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure,
the insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds to the Township Manager in the aggregate $2,000
for each $15,000 and each fraction of that amount of a claim, or, if at
the time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount
calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurance
company, association or exchange shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. The transfer of proceeds
shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the Township shall be disbursed in accordance with
the policy terms. The named insured may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer shall
return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named
insured if the Township has not commenced to remove, repair or secure
the building or other structure. The municipal duties of this chapter
shall be carried out by the Township Manager on behalf of Brighton
Township.
§ 147-1 BRIGHTON CODE § 147-1
1:166
D. Upon receipt of proceeds by the Township as authorized by this chapter,
the Township Manager shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the Township. When transferring the funds as
required in Subsection C of this section, an insurance company,
association or exchange shall provide the Township with the name and
address of the named insured, whereupon the Township shall contact
the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the
Township and notify the named insured that the procedures under this
subsection shall be followed. The fund shall be returned to the named
insured when repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed and the required proof received by the
Township Manager if the Township has not incurred any costs for
repairs, removal or securing. If the Township has incurred costs for
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs
shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess funds remain, the Township
shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to limit the ability of the Township to recover
any deficiency. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prohibit the Township and the named insured from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if
some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
E. Proof of payment by the insurance company, association or exchange of
proceeds under a policy in accordance with Subsection C of this section
is conclusive evidence of the discharge of its obligation to the insured
under the policy to the extent of the payment and of compliance by the
company, association or exchange with Subsection C of this section.
F. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to make an insurance
company, association or exchange liable for any amount in excess of
proceeds payable under its insurance policy or for any other act
performed pursuant to this chapter or to make the Township of
Brighton an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an
obligation to pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal liens or
expenses other than as provided in this chapter.
G. An insurance company, association or exchange making payments of
policy proceeds under this chapter for delinquent taxes or structure
removal liens or removal expenses incurred by a municipality shall have
a full benefit of such payment, including all rights of subrogation and of
assignment.
H. This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose to
deter the commission of arson and related crimes, to discourage the
abandonment of property and to prevent urban blight and
deterioration.

or estimates or measurements made by the water utility, the township or
the Authority, as the case may be.
WATER UTILITY  The water company or any other utility, public or quasipublic
corporation or utility supplying water within the territorial limits of
the Ohio River watershed of the township and its successors and assigns.
§ 160-30. Admission of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage to
sewer system.
A. The economy and desirability of the combined collection, transportation
and treatment of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage is recognized.
Any and all industrial wastes and sanitary sewage may be discharged
into the sewer system except those which are deemed harmful to the
sewer system or the sewage treatment works or the operation thereof
or are specifically prohibited by this article, the Authority or under the
provisions of the Agreement. However, it is also recognized that the
collection, transportation and treatment of any wastes and sewage from
time to time determined to be acceptable but which are abnormal
industrial wastes and abnormal sanitary sewage may add to the cost of
operating and maintaining the sewer system and the sewage treatment
§ 160-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-30
1:189
works. Such additional cost should be borne by the person receiving the
benefit of such collection, transportation and treatment.
B. The Board reserves the right to refuse connection to the sewer system
for discharge of deleterious industrial wastes or to compel users of the
sewer system to discontinue the use of the sewer system for such
wastes or to require pretreatment thereof in order to prevent harmful
or adverse effect upon the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment
works. The design, construction and operation of such pretreatment
facilities shall be subject to the approval of the Board. The standards to
be used by the Board in the enforcement of this article, and particularly
this Subsection B and § 160-31A, C and D, shall be at least comparable
to those used by the Borough Authority in connection with its sewer
system and sewage treatment plant.
C. The Board reserves the right to require industries having large
variations in the rate of discharge of industrial waste to install suitable
regulating devices, approved by the Board, for equalizing industrial
waste flows and as may be required by the Authority.
D. Industrial waste and sanitary sewage will be considered harmful to the
sewer system and the sewage treatment works if it may cause any of the
following damaging effects:
(1) Chemical reaction either directly or indirectly with the materials of
construction of the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment
works in such a manner as to impair the strength or durability of
such structures;
(2) Mechanical action that will destroy such sewer structures;
(3) Restriction of the hydraulic capacity of such sewer structures;
(4) Restriction of the normal inspection or maintenance of such sewer
structures;
(5) Danger to public health and safety; or
(6) Obnoxious condition inimical to public interest.
E. The Board may, at its discretion, require any person discharging
industrial wastes or combined industrial wastes and sanitary sewage
into the sewer system to install a suitable manhole or manholes on his
connecting sewer or sewers to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the flow of wastes from the premises. Such manhole or
manholes shall be installed by such person at his expense, maintained
by such person so as to be safe and accessible to the Board at all times
and constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Board.
F. The Board shall have the right of access at all reasonable times to
dwelling units, residences, business and other buildings, institutions,
schools, churches and industrial or commercial establishments and to
any meters used for establishing, analyzing or determining water

treatment works and sewage and/or industrial wastes discharged into
the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works.
A. The discharge of excessive amounts of unpolluted water or waste into
the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works is expressly
prohibited. The Board reserves the right to define the amount it deems
excessive in each particular instance and to determine the adequacy of
a sewer's capacity.
B. The discharge of garbage to the sewer system is expressly prohibited
except from single-family dwelling units, and in such cases, the garbage
must be first properly shredded by a mechanical garbage grinder or
disposer of a type approved by the Board.
C. No person shall discharge or permit the discharge or infiltration into
the sewer system or the sewage treatment works of any of the following
substances:
(1) Wastes containing ashes, cinders, sand, mud, greases, lime or
acetylene sludges, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, sawdust, paunch manure, cotton, chemical or paint

spent mash and grain, pulp from food processing, water or wastes
containing grease, fat or oil in excess of 100 ppm or any other
liquids, gases, solids or viscous substances which by reason of their
quality, quantity or characteristics may cause fire, explosion,
obstruction to the flow in the sewer system and/or the sewage
treatment works or in any other way interfere with or be
deleterious to persons, the structure, the persons, the structures or
the proper operation of the sewer system and/or the sewage
treatment works.

and regulations, in addition to those set forth in this article, as the
Board, with the advice of its consulting engineer, shall deem necessary
or appropriate for the efficient operation, maintenance and
preservation of the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works or
the sewer business operation. The construction, meaning and
application of the prohibited wastes and sanitary sewage regulations
set forth in Subsection C above shall be made by the Board and shall be
binding and conclusive with respect to users of the sewer system and/or
the sewage treatment works, as the case may be, and shall be
consistent with any such construction, meaning and application made
§ 160-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-31
1:193
§ 160-32. Sewer service charge; schedule of rates.
by the Authority of any similar prohibited wastes and sanitary sewage
regulations.
A. There is hereby imposed upon the owners of or the users of water in or
on all properties situate within the geographical limits of the township
and served by the sewer system a sewer service charge for the
collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of industrial wastes
and sanitary sewage, payable as hereinafter provided in the amounts
hereinafter provided. Said owners and users shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of the sewer service charge and the
penalty herein prescribed for delinquent payment thereof. The sewer
service charge for the collection, transportation, treatment and
disposal of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage shall begin to accrue
with respect to any owners and users connecting, directly or indirectly,
to the new sanitary sewer lines to be constructed by the Authority or
any extensions or capital additions thereto, from and after the earlier of
when the owners and users connect to the sewer system or on a date 60
days after notice to connect to the sewer system is given as provided in
the ordinances of the township.
B. The sewer service charge for the collection, transportation, treatment
and disposal of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage in every case
shall be based on the volume of water used in or on said properties as
follows:
(1) The sewer service charge of township users, which includes the
sewage charge required under the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, shall be:
(a) Metered water users. The following schedule of rates shall be
applicable to each township user of metered water, and the
sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water
used as measured by the most recent available water meter
reading; and the sewer service charge shall consist of the
following two component parts:
[1] For operation and maintenance of the sewer system and
the treatment plant, the quarterly charge shall be $0.95
per 1,000 gallons of water used per quarter; and
[2] For debt service, the quarterly charge shall be:
Water used per Quarter
Year
Sewer Service Charge
For the first 12,000 gallons or
any part thereof
$25.80 per quarter
(minimum)
For excess over 12,000 gallons $2.15 per 1,000 gallons
feet
§ 160-31 BRIGHTON CODE § 160-32
1:194
(b) Nonmetered water users. All owners of or users of water in or
on all properties having an unmetered private water supply
and/or supplied with unmetered water service by any water
utility shall pay a flat rate sewer service charge equal to 12,000
gallons per quarter per dwelling unit or its adjusted equivalent
for sewer service periods of less than 1/4 of one year. These
charges will be billed at the same rate per 1,000 gallons as
metered water users. [Amended 7-12-1979 by Ord. No. 71]
C. Owners and users shall be billed monthly. The first two monthly billings
shall be based upon the minimum applicable service charge or upon
estimated water uses as the Board may determine and the third
monthly billing being based on actual water usage shown by the water
utility's most recent available water meter reading or upon the
appropriate minimum sewer service charge, whichever is greater. All
bills for sewer service charges shall be due when rendered and, if not
paid within 30 days from the date the bill is rendered, shall be subject
to a penalty of 10%; and if the bill is not paid within 45 days, the billing
shall include interest of 1/2 of 1% per month or part thereof upon 110%
of the sewer charge until paid. [Amended 7-12-1979 by Ord. No. 71]
D. The measurement by two or more meters of the quantity of water used
in or on one property by one owner or user may be combined and the
sewer service charge billed to said owner or user as though the quantity
of water was measured by one meter, if the Board so elects.
E. Where two or more families or dwelling units receive water through one
water meter, multiple minimum sewer service charges shall be billed.
F. In the event that the owner of or the user of water in or on any
industrial or commercial property served by the sewer system and/or
the sewage treatment works obtains part or all of the water used in or
on such property from sources other than the water utility, such owner
or user shall, upon demand of the Board and at no expense to the
township, install and maintain a water meter or meters satisfactory to
the Board for measuring all water used other than that obtained from
the water utility, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer
service charge shall be the quantity of water measured by all such
meters plus the quantity of water obtained from the water utility.
G. In the event that it is established to the satisfaction of the Board that a
portion of the water used in or on any property served by the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works does not and cannot enter
the sewer system and/or sewage treatment works, the Board may
require or permit the installation of additional meters in such manner
as to determine either the quantity of water excluded from the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works or the quantity of water,
sewage and industrial wastes actually entering the sewer system and/or
the sewage treatment works, exclusive of stormwater runoff, surface
water and groundwater. The sewer service charge shall be based upon
the quantity of water measured or computed by the Board to be actually
§ 160-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-32
1:195
§ 160-33. Surcharge for certain industrial wastes.
entering the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works,
exclusive of stormwater runoff, surface water and groundwater, subject
to the minimum charge set forth in Subsection B hereof. [Amended
7-12-1979 by Ord. No. 71]
H. Any person requesting a reduction of the amount of the sewer service
charge because of water purchased which does not enter the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works shall make written
application to the Board, giving the name of such person, his address
and setting forth supporting data fully describing other sources of
water, if any, as well as the disposition of water alleged not to be
entering the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works. The
application shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale
showing the plan of the property, the water distribution system, sewer
layout, existing meters and proposed meters in the scheme to
determine the quantity of flow entering or not entering, the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works. The cost of furnishing,
installing and maintaining any meters other than those utilized to
measure water purchased from the water utility shall be borne by the
applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of
such meters shall be subject to the approval of the Board and the water
utility.
I. The Board may require the exclusion from the sewer system and/or the
sewage treatment works of noncontaminated waste waters and waters
used for cooling purposes.
A. There is hereby imposed a surcharge upon the owners of and the users
of water in or on all properties discharging or permitting to be
discharged or infiltrated into the sewer system and/or the sewage
treatment works abnormal industrial wastes, which surcharge is
intended to cover the additional cost to the sewer system and/or the
sewage treatment works resulting from the treatment and disposal of
such abnormal industrial waste. Such surcharges shall be in addition to
the regular sewer service charge set forth in § 160-32 of this article and
shall be payable as hereinafter provided in the amount hereinafter
provided.
B. The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is subject
to surcharge, shall be determined monthly or more frequently from
samples taken either at the manhole referred to in § 160-30E hereof or
at any other sampling point mutually agreed upon by the Board and the
producer of such wastes. The frequency and duration of the sampling
period shall be such as, in the opinion of the Board, will permit a
reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of such
wastes, exclusive of stormwater runoff, surface water and groundwater.
Samples shall be collected by the Board in proportion to the flow of
wastes, exclusive of stormwater runoff, surface water and groundwater,
and composited for analysis in accordance with the latest edition of
§ 160-32 BRIGHTON CODE § 160-33
1:196
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage as
published by the American Public Health Association. Except as
hereinafter provided, the strength of such wastes so found by analysis
shall be used for establishing the surcharge or surcharges. The Board
may, if it so elects, accept the results of routine sampling and analyses
by the producer of such wastes in lieu of making its own samplings and
analyses.
C. In the event that any industrial waste is found by the Board to have a
BOD in excess of 300 ppm, the owners of and the users of water in or on
the property from which such wastes are discharged shall be
surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of
wastes in thousand gallons per billing period, exclusive of stormwater
runoff, surface water and groundwater, discharged to the sewer system
and/or the sewage treatment works; and the BOD surcharge rate. The
BOD surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula:
Rc = 0.00834 P (C-300)
Where:
Rc = the BOD surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of waste
discharged
P = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost
of treatment processes per pound of BOD received at the
sewage treatment works including chlorination. (Prior to
completion of the first year of operation, the value of P shall
be deemed to be $0.04.)
C = the average BOD of the industrial waste expressed in ppm
as determined in accordance with Subsection B hereof.
The figure "300" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum BOD permissible without surcharge. The figure "0.00834"
is the factor to convert parts per million to pounds per 1,000 gallons.
No discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having a
BOD less than 300 ppm.
D. In the event that any industrial waste is found, by the Board, to have an
average suspended solid concentration in excess of 275 ppm, the
owners of and the users of water in or on the property from which such
wastes are discharged shall be surcharged an amount equal to the
product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand gallons per billing
period, exclusive of stormwater runoff, surface water and groundwater,
discharged to the sewer system and/or the sewage treatment works,
and the suspended solids surcharge rate. The suspended solids
surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula:
Rs = 0.00834 x B (S - 275)
Where:
Rs = the suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1,000
gallons of waste discharged
§ 160-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-33
1:197
§ 160-34. Billing and collection.
B = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost
of the sludge digestion, sludge drying and sludge disposal
operations per pound of suspended solids received at the
sewage treatment works. (Prior to completion of the first
year of operation, the value of B shall be deemed to be
$0.04.)
S = the average suspended solids concentration of the
abnormal industrial wastes expressed in ppm, as
determined in accordance with Subsection B hereof.
The figure "275" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum suspended solids concentration permissible without
surcharge. The figure "0.00834" is the factor to convert parts per
million to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted for
sewage or industrial wastes having a suspended solids concentration
less than 275 ppm.
E. The surcharges provided for in this article will be added to the service
charges set forth in § 160-32. They will be billed monthly and shall be
due at the same time and shall be subject to the same penalty as set
forth in § 160-32C hereof.
A. The sewer service charge and the surcharges, where applicable,
provided for in this article shall be payable in monthly payments each
year as provided in § 160-32C hereof.
B. The Board, either directly or through any person whom it may by
resolution appoint or with whom it may contract, including the
Authority or its agent, will render such bills for the sewer service
charges and surcharges imposed by this article and will make
collections thereof in accordance with this article and the Agreement.
C. Bills and notices relating to the sewer service charges and surcharges
will be mailed or delivered to the property owner's and/or the water
user's last address as shown on the books of the Board and/or the water
utility, and the Board shall not be otherwise responsible for delivery of
such bills and notices. No change of address will be honored unless and
until such change shall have been furnished in writing to the Board and
the water utility.
D. The Board shall have access at all reasonable times to residences,
business and other buildings, institutions, schools, churches and
industrial and commercial establishments connected to the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works and to any water meters
measuring water used in such places and establishments to inspect
such meters, the connection with the sewer system and/or the sewage
treatment works and/or the discharge of sanitary sewage, water of any
kind and industrial waste into the sewer system and/or the sewage
treatment works.
§ 160-33 BRIGHTON CODE § 160-34
1:198
§ 160-35. Delinquencies; violations and penalties; remedies.
E. The Board shall have the power and authority at any time and from time
to time to make such other rules and regulations or to change the
foregoing provisions with respect to the manner and procedure of
billing and collections as said Board, in its sole discretion, may
determine, consistent with the Agreement.
A. Each sewer service charge, surcharge, penalty and interest imposed by
this article shall be a debt due the township and shall be a lien on the
property served and if not paid within 30 days after the date rendered
shall be deemed delinquent. In such event, the township may proceed
to file a lien in the office of the Prothonotary of Beaver County,
Pennsylvania, and collect the same in the manner provided by law for
the filing and collection of municipal claims; or the township may
proceed to collect such delinquent sewer service charge, surcharge,
penalty and interest by an action in assumpsit or by distress of personal
property on the premises or by any other legal or equitable remedy then
available to the township. In the event of failure to pay the sewer
service charge, surcharge, penalty and interest after they become
delinquent as herein provided, the township shall be authorized, in
addition to any other remedies authorized by law and to the extent
authorized by law, to shut off or cause to be shut off the water to be
delivered to such property and/or to remove or close the sanitary sewer
connection and shall have the right to enter upon the property served
for such purposes and to take such steps as may be necessary to
accomplish the same; and any expenses with respect thereto, as well as
the expense of restoring any such water and/or sewer service or
connection, shall likewise be a debt due the township and a lien on the
property served and may be filed and collected as hereinabove
provided, and such water and/or sanitary sewer connection may not
again be turned on or restored for the same owner or user until all
sewer service charges, surcharges, penalties and interest, including the
expense of removal, closing and restoration, shall have been paid.
B. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall, upon
conviction thereof before any District Justice, be sentenced to pay a fine
of not more than $300 for each and every offense and costs and, in
default of payment of said fine and costs, be imprisoned in the Beaver
County Jail for a period not exceeding 30 days until such fine and costs
are paid. Whenever such person shall have been notified in writing by
the Board that that he is violating this article, each three-day-period
that he shall continue such violation after receipt of such notification
shall constitute a separate offense punishable by a like fine hereunder
upon conviction thereof.
C. Change of ownership or occupancy of any property served by the sewer
system and/or the sewage treatment works as to which the service
charge, surcharge, penalty or interest imposed by this article is
delinquent, as provided in Subsection A hereof, shall not be a cause for

Part 1
Stormwater Management
ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 173-1. Statement of findings.
§ 173-2. Purpose.
This chapter is adopted and implemented to achieve the following general
purposes and objectives:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater
and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying
capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, and greatly increases
the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
B. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
C. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
D. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood-control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases pollution of water
resources.
E. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated
small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s).
A. To manage stormwater runoff resulting from land alterations and
disturbance activities in accordance with the Pennsylvania Stormwater
Management Act (Act 167 of 1978, as amended);43
B. To utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems
and to preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams;
43.Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 173-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-2
1:227
§ 173-3. Statutory authority.
The Township also is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.44
§ 173-4. Applicability.
Stormwater management facilities shall be provided for subdivisions, land
developments, and all activities which change the slope of the land or
the land cover and shall be designed to ensure that the maximum rate of
stormwater runoff from the site shall be no greater after development than
is the rate of runoff from the site prior to development.
§ 173-5. Repealer.
This Part 1 shall repeal all other Code provisions, or parts thereof, which
are contrary to or conflict with the provisions of this Part to the extent
necessary to give this Part full force and effect.
§ 173-6. Severability.
Should any part of this Part 1 be declared invalid, such decision shall not
affect the validity of any other part, nor the Part as a whole.
§ 173-7. Compatibility.
Actions taken under this Part 1 do not affect any responsibility, permit or
approval for any activity regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or
ordinance.
§ 173-8. Definitions.
For the purposes of this Part 1, the terms used herein shall have the
following definitions. The words "shall" and "must" shall be mandatory;
single and plural, and feminine and masculine, are equivalent.
C. To encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater
supplies and stream flows;
D. To provide for adequate maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities in the Township;
E. To provide review procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning and management;
F. To manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes; and
G. To maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.

by Ord. No. 201]
existing storm sewer, existing drainage ditch or existing stormwater
storage facility.
E. Techniques described in Appendix 3 (Low-Impact Development)47 of
this Part are encouraged, because they reduce the costs of complying
with the requirements of this Part and the state water quality
requirements.
A. At the time of application, the Township shall determine if the
development qualifies as a small development and, therefore, is eligible
for a simplified stormwater plan submission. For the purposes of this
chapter, a "small development" is:
(1) Any development which results (or will result when fully
constructed) in the creation of 5,000 or less square feet of
impervious surface area, including roofs, patios, driveways, and
sidewalks.
B. The small project stormwater management plan application, available
upon request at the Township office, may be used for projects under
5,000 square feet of proposed impervious surface. The small project
stormwater management plan application documents new impervious
surface at the project site and assists in sizing of stormwater controls
for a small development.
C. Should the applicant choose not to use the small project stormwater
management plan application, a plan, prepared and sealed by a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Pennsylvania,
demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this chapter and
which describes, narratively and graphically, the type and location of
proposed on-site stormwater management techniques or the proposed
connection to an existing storm sewer system must be submitted.
Depending upon actual site conditions, the number of lots proposed and
similar considerations, the Township Engineer shall determine if the
plan must be prepared by a Pennsylvania registered professional
engineer licensed in the State of Pennsylvania.
D. The Township Engineer shall review the proposed provisions for
stormwater management for small developments. Where the applicant
is proposing to connect to an existing storm sewer, the applicant's
engineer shall determine that sufficient capacity exists in the storm
sewer from the point of connection to the point of outlet in the natural
drainage system. The Township Engineer shall also determine if the
proposed development site is part of a larger parcel or tract which was
subject to any specific stormwater management controls contained in a
prior plan.

§ 173-11. Additional requirements.
§ 173-12. Stormwater management plan required; exemptions;
contents.
E. For a parcel or tract of land held in single ownership, only one
application for a small development, as defined above, shall be
permitted before requiring a stormwater management plan for the
entire parcel. A project cannot be phased to circumvent the stormwater
requirements by using the exemption for small developments. When
calculating new impervious area for determining whether a
development qualifies as a small development, the cumulative total of
all impervious areas constructed within five years of the application
date shall be considered.
A. In conjunction with meeting the requirements of this Part 1, the
applicant shall refer to and meet all conditions and requirements set
forth in Brighton Township's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System
(MS4) Prohibited Discharge Ordinance.48
A. No final subdivision or land development plan shall be approved, no
permit authorizing construction issued, nor any earthmoving or land
disturbance activity initiated until the final stormwater management
plan for the development site is approved in accordance with the
provisions of this Part 1.
B. A letter from the Beaver County Conservation District (BCCD)
approving the erosion and sedimentation control plan must also be
received prior to the initiation of any grading. In the event that
submission to the BCCD is not required by the Township, an erosion and
sedimentation control plan prepared in accordance with the mostrecent
version of PADEP Chapter 102, Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Program Manual, must be approved by the Township.
C. Exemptions. The following activities are specifically exempt from this
Part:
(1) Use of land for gardening primarily for home consumption.
(2) Use of land for construction of landscaping improvements,
provided such improvements do not significantly alter the runoff
characteristics for the land.
(3) Agricultural use of lands when operated in accordance with a farm
conservation plan approved by the BCCD, or when it is determined
by the BCCD that such use will not cause excessive erosion and
sedimentation.

49.Editor's Note: Appendix 1 is included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 173-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13
1:241
(1) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent injury to health, safety and other property.
Such measures shall include, but not be limited to, such actions as
are required for the following:
(a) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities.
(b) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which will not adversely impact
the health on, or value of, any affected properties.
(c) No discharge of toxic materials into any stormwater
management system will be permitted.
(d) Where applicable, stormwater management facilities shall
comply with the requirements of Chapter 105 (Dam Safety and
Waterway Management) of Title 25, Environmental Protection,
of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as authorized by
the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
(e) Stormwater management facilities that involve a state highway
shall be subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation.
(f) Stormwater runoff from a project site shall flow directly into a
natural watercourse or into an existing storm sewer system, or
onto adjacent properties in a manner similar to the runoff
characteristics of the predevelopment flow.
(g) Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed
to another unless the watersheds are subareas of a larger
watershed that are tributary to a common point of interest
within or near the perimeter of the property. Transfer of runoff
from one watershed to another under any other circumstances
shall only be approved at the discretion of the Township.
Documentation shall be provided that peak flow rates are not
increased following development and there will be no
detrimental impact in downstream areas.
(h) All stormwater runoff flowing over the project site shall be
considered in the design of the stormwater management
facilities.
(i) For any stormwater management facility requiring a permit to
be issued by PADEP, said permit, along with the supporting
report and plans used to secure the permit, shall also be
submitted.
§ 173-13 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-13
1:242
(2) Fees and expenses.
(a) The Township may charge a reasonable fee for review of BMP
operations and maintenance plans to defray review costs
incurred by the Township. The applicant shall pay all such fees.
(b) The fees required by this Part may cover:
[1] Administrative/clerical costs of 5%.
[2] The review of the BMP operations and maintenance plan
by the Township Engineer.
[3] The site inspections, including, but not limited to,
preconstruction meetings, inspections during construction
of stormwater BMPs, and final inspection upon completion
of the stormwater BMPs.
[4] Any additional work required to monitor and enforce any
provisions of this Part, correct violations, and assure
proper completion of stipulated remedial actions.
(3) Design storms.
(a) Design storms. Stormwater management facilities on all
development sites shall control the peak stormwater discharge
for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and onehundred-
year design storms. For developments larger than
three acres, the SCS twenty-four-hour, Type II rainfall
distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff in
pre- and post-development conditions, as well as for designing
runoff control facilities (except storm runoff collection and
conveyance facilities). For development sites less than three
acres, the Rational Method may be utilized to determine peak
flows and the Modified Rational Method used for design and
routing of runoff control facilities.
(b) All stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be designed
with emergency overflow facilities for the one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour duration storm, unless positive measures are
installed to control the inflow so as not to exceed the safe
capacity of the retention/detention facility.
(c) The stormwater volume required for all stormwater retention/
detention facilities shall be that volume necessary to handle
runoff of a one-hundred-year storm in any development, less
that volume discharged during the same storm period used to
calculate the volume of rainfall, at the approved release rate.
(d) The SCS Type II rainfall distribution shall be used for all
analyses. The design storm frequencies for the watershed are:
§ 173-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13
1:243
Design Storm
(years)
Rainfall Depth 24 Hours
(inches)
1 1.97
2 2.46
5 3.3
10 3.8
25 3.9
50 4.4
100 5.0
(For additional information or data on other return periods,
consult the "Rainfall Duration Frequency Tables for
Pennsylvania", produced by PADEP, Office of Resource
Management, Bureau of Dams and Waterways Management,
Division of Stormwater Management, Harrisburg.)
(4) The stormwater management plan shall consider all of the
stormwater runoff flowing over the project site. Runoff calculations
shall be made to ensure that runoff from the upstream watershed
area can be accommodated by the pipes, drainage easements and
watercourses, etc., on the site.
(5) Predevelopment conditions. The cover type for all sites will be
considered to be woods with light underbrush in good hydrologic
conditions at the time of proposed development. All hydrologic
parameters used to calculate peak flow rates shall use the
appropriate coefficients pertaining to these conditions, as
recommended in the hydrologic methodologies noted in
§ 173-13A(9).
(6) Post-development conditions. The hydrologic parameters used to
develop peak flow rates shall be reflective of anticipated soil runoff
characteristics following grading and development of the site.
(7) Normally dry, open-top storage BMPs should drain in 24 to 72
hours from the end of the storm.
(8) Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems
may be planned and constructed in coordination with two or more
developments, provided they are in compliance with the applicable
provisions of this Part.
(9) Method of computation.
(a) All computations used in conjunction with the analysis and
design of stormwater management facilities shall be based on
one or more of the following methods:
§ 173-13 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-13
1:244
[1] TR-55, Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No.
55.
[2] TR-20, Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No.
20.
[3] Modified Rational Method.
[4] Penn State Runoff Model.
[5] Virginia Tech/Penn State Runoff Model.
(b) These methods for determining peak discharge shall be used
to:
[1] Determine predevelopment runoff conditions;
[2] Analyze the impact of development; and
[3] Perform calculations in the design of any detention/
retention facilities used in controlling runoff.
(c) These methods of runoff computation developed and used by
the NRCS and other authorities are hereby adopted by the
Township.
(d) The use of the Basic Rational Method in estimating runoff may
be employed in the design of the storm sewer system within
the development. The "storm sewer system" shall be
interpreted as the conduits, culverts, inlets and appurtenant
features for the conveying of stormwater to, through or from a
development site to the point of final discharge or control
facility. The Rational Method shall not be used in the analysis
of stormwater runoff from the development in its entirety or in
conjunction with the design of any retention/detention
facilities or other runoff control measures.
(10) Release of detained stormwater. The approved peak release rate of
stormwater from all retention/detention facilities for any storm
event shall be that which is experienced prior to development for
the same storm event up to and including the one-hundred-year
storm. Therefore, all retention/detention facilities shall provide
staged release of the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and
one-hundred-year storms.
(11) Stormwater management facilities. Design of stormwater
management facilities outlined in the plan requires that runoff
calculations be made for the site and areas which contribute
drainage to the site. These calculations should be based on land
use, time of concentration and other standard aspects of hydraulic
analysis.
§ 173-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13
1:245
(a) Temporary control measures/facilities. Runoff calculations of
the site's condition during development will be used to size
temporary control measures.
(b) Permanent control measures/facilities. In most cases,
permanent control measures/facilities shall be designed to
assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities,
utilizing the one-hundred-year storm as a basis for
calculations. Storm sewer systems may be designed for the
twenty-five-year storm, provided that the runoff will naturally
drain to the detention facility; otherwise the storm sewer
system must be designed for the one-hundred-year storm
event. Runoff calculations must be made to ensure that runoff
from the upstream watershed area can be accommodated by
the pipes, drainage easements, watercourses, etc., on the site
as well as those downstream of the site to a point of permanent
discharge. Where downstream facilities are not adequate to
convey the flow, reduced release rates shall be considered to
ensure no detrimental impact to the downstream facilities shall
occur as a result of the development. A drainage easement
shall be provided to contain and convey the one-hundred-year
flood event throughout the project site, beginning at the
furthest upstream property line of the proposed development
in the watersheds.
(12) Runoff calculations shall also include complete hydrology and
hydraulic analysis of all downstream swales and pipe facilities to
the discharge point as well as erosion control facilities, including,
but not limited to:
(a) Velocities of flow, slopes, capacity and roughness coefficient of
conduits and grassed waterways.
(b) Capacity of sediment basins and permanent holding ponds.
(c) All drainage facilities shall be designed to contain the energy
grade line for the peak flow rate for the design storm within
the structures a minimum of two feet below the surface
elevation. The hydraulic grade line must be within the pipe.
Swales and channels shall provide at least one foot of
freeboard. Backwater effects of pipes discharging under
surcharge conditions shall be included.
(13) Single-family lots. [Amended 4-11-2016 by Ord. No. 201]
(a) Retention/detention facilities shall be constructed for all
existing single-family lot developments or single-family lots
located in land developments which for terrain reasons cannot
utilize the development's retention/detention systems.
Retention facilities shall consist of gravel-filled sumps, ponds,
§ 173-13 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-13
1:246
tanks or other approved facilities, sized in accordance with
standard details in the Township Construction Standards.
Single-family lots qualifying as a small development may utilize
the small project stormwater management plan application as
outlined in § 173-10.
(b) Stormwater facilities for single-family lots proposing greater
than 5,000 square feet of impervious area shall be calculated
using the methods outlined in § 173-13.
(14) Easements.
(a) Easements for stormwater management facilities shall be
required to have a minimum width of 20 feet. Where a
subdivision or land development is, or will be, traversed by a
watercourse, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage
easement of a width sufficient for the purpose, but not less
than 20 feet. The stormwater detention facilities must be
provided within a drainage easement. An access easement
must be provided from the public right-of-way to the
stormwater detention facility with a minimum width of 20 feet.
[1] Stormwater management easements are required for all
areas used for off-site stormwater control, unless a waiver
is granted by the Township.
[2] Stormwater management easements shall be provided by
the property owner if necessary for access for inspections
and maintenance, or preservation of stormwater runoff
conveyance, infiltration, and detention areas and other
BMPs, by persons other than the property owner. The
purpose of the easement shall be specified in any
agreement under § 173-13.
[3] Facilities, areas, or structures used as stormwater
management BMPs shall be enumerated as permanent
real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed
restrictions or conservation easements that run with the
land.
[4] Operation and management plans for stormwater
management approved pursuant to 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102 after the date of this Part shall be recorded as a
restrictive deed covenant that runs with the land.
[5] If a conservation easement is provided, the long-term
ownership, access, maintenance, and use restrictions must
be identified on the recording plan.
(15) Flood-prone areas.
§ 173-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13
1:247
(a) Land identified as flood-prone on maps issued by the Federal
Insurance Administration shall be subject to the regulations of
the National Flood Insurance Program and shall comply with
the provisions of the Township Floodplain Ordinance.50
(b) The one-hundred-year floodplain shall be delineated by one of
the following methods:

used to determine floodplain limits shall be provided.
(c) Municipal liability disclaimer. Approval of a stormwater
management plan by the Township shall not be construed as an
indication that said plan complies with the requirements, laws,
or standards of any agency of the commonwealth, which may
or may not govern said activity.
(16) Stormwater detention facilities.
(a) If retention/detention facilities are utilized for the development
site, the facility shall be designed such that the postdevelopment
peak runoff rates from the development site are
controlled to those rates defined by the subarea release-rate
percentage or no-harm evaluation for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year design storms;
except, however, where downstream flooding problems exist,
the Township may impose additional reduced release-rate
criteria.
(b) All retention/detention facilities shall be equipped with
multistage outlet structures to provide discharge control for
the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundredyear
storm frequencies. Provisions shall also be made for safely
passing the post-development one hundred-year storm runoff
flows without damaging (i.e., impairing the continued function
of) the facilities.
(c) Shared-storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site, may be considered within a
single subarea. Such facilities shall meet the design criteria
contained in this section. In addition, runoff from the
development sites involved shall be conveyed to the facility in a
manner so as to avoid adverse impacts, such as flooding or
erosion, to channels and properties located between the
development site and the shared-storage facility.

§ 173-13 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-13
1:248
(d) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple-use
facilities, such as lakes, ballfields or similar recreation uses,
are encouraged wherever feasible.
(e) As a general rule, detention facilities will be designed as dry
basins, although wet facilities will be considered in specific
situations where they can be shown to represent a significant
amenity to the development and/or the Township. Facilities
should be designed to cause water depths as shallow as
possible.
(f) Except in approved wet basins, stormwater detention basins
will be designed to drain completely. A low-flow channel shall
be installed to facilitate the conveyance of storm sewer flows to
the basin outlet during frequent storm events. All interior
portions of the basin will slope toward the outlet or low flow
channel at a minimum slope of 1%. Refer to the Township
Minimum Construction Standards and Standard Details, Detail
SW-04. All impoundment areas shall be adequately under
drained to prevent long-term ponding of water. [Amended
4-11-2016 by Ord. No. 201]
(g) Detention facility outfall pipes shall have a minimum of two
antiseepage collars installed along the profile of the pipe.
Antiseepage collars shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete. Refer to the Township Minimum Construction
Standards and Standard Details, Detail SW-05. [Amended
4-11-2016 by Ord. No. 201]
(h) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the
design of the detention facilities include:
[1] Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and
installed to prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundmenttype
structures should be protected from soil erosion.
[2] Control and removal of debris, both in the storage
structure and in all inlet or outlet devices, shall be a design
consideration.
[3] Inflow and outflow structures and other structures shall be
protected and designed to minimize safety hazards.
[4] The water depth of a storage pond which is not fenced
shall be limited to two feet, unless approved by the
Township Engineer. Otherwise, appropriate landscaped
fencing at least four feet in height shall be required.
[5] Side slopes of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of 3:1
horizontal to vertical dimension. Design of facilities with
flatter slopes for aesthetics and as a maintenance
consideration are encouraged. Refer to the Township
§ 173-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13

Minimum Construction Standards and Standard Details,
Details SW-01 and SW-02. Crest of the embankment shall
have a minimum width of not less than 10 feet. [Amended
4-11-2016 by Ord. No. 201]
[6] The embankment shall be level along the crest and along
the longitudinal center line. In the event that the
embankment would be overtopped by stormwater runoff,
the flow over the crest and down the downstream slope
would be sheet flow rather than being concentrated and
eroding away the embankment. No trees shall be planted
on the embankment. Should any type of protective fence
placed be around the impoundment, the fence shall not be
placed on the embankment or across the primary or
emergency spillways.
[7] Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area.
[8] All stormwater detention facilities shall be screened from
view of existing roads or streets located within the
Township, which is a minimum of six feet in height with
sufficient access for maintenance vehicles. The screening
material must be approved by the Township.
[9] The facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will
be required.
[10] The facility shall be equipped with an access road at least
10 feet wide and with a maximum of grade of 15%. An
access easement with a minimum width of 20 feet to all
stormwater detention facilities shall be provided by the
owner. The access easement shall include a statement on
the recorded plan from the owner/operator of the facility
granting access to the Township.
[11] All pond outlet structures shall have suitable gaskets to
prevent leakage and piping of water through the pond
embankment. All storm pipe installed through the pond
embankment must be constructed of reinforced concrete
pipe.
[12] Detention facilities that are designed as sedimentation
facilities during construction operations shall be desilted
and regraded to original design dimensions and have all
temporary sedimentation control devices removed prior to
their conversion to detention facilities. Low-flow channels
and underdrains should be installed with the conversion of
the facility.
§ 173-13 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-13
1:250
§ 173-14. Construction criteria for stormwater control facilities.
Stormwater management facilities shall be constructed in accordance with
the following minimum specifications:
[13] In subdivisions or projects that are constructed in phases
with individual detention facilities employed as
sedimentation basins, said facilities shall be converted to
their ultimate use as stormwater management facilities as
soon as their tributary areas are stabilized per BCCD
standards. This conversion may be requested by the
Township, with supportive corroboration from the BCCD,
and shall be implemented as outlined in the approved
erosion and sedimentation control plan.
[14] Except where special erosion protection measures are
provided, all disturbed areas will be graded evenly, topped
with four inches of topsoil, fertilized, seeded and mulched
by methods consistent with PennDOT Publication 408.
[15] All outfalls to and from the facility shall be provided with
end walls and erosion control measures. Refer to the
Township Minimum Construction Standards and Standard
Details, Details SS-03 and SS-05. [Amended 4-11-2016
by Ord. No. 201]
[16] Outlet control structures shall be constructed of
reinforced concrete (cast-in-place or precast) and shall be
recessed into the embankment wherever practical. Trash
racks for low-flow control openings should be designed to
provide four to 10 times the area of the low-flow opening,
and facilitate debris removal and maintenance. Refer to
the Township Minimum Construction Standards and
Standard Details, Detail SW-03. [Amended 4-11-2016 by
Ord. No. 201]
(i) A geotechnical investigation report for the construction of the
stormwater detention/retention and infiltration facilities must
be provided, including design recommendation for
embankment construction, interior and exterior slopes,
drainage swales and infiltration areas.
A. All workmanship and materials shall conform to the Township
Construction Standards as provided in the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.51 In addition, all workmanship and materials
shall conform to the latest edition of PennDOT Form 408.

1:251
§ 173-15. Maintenance criteria for stormwater control facilities.
Maintenance is an essential part of the successful functioning of a
stormwater management system, and the following shall be required:
B. All connections to existing storm sewer pipes shall be made by
construction of a suitable junction box (inlet or manhole) to provide
access for clean-out. No blind connections shall be permitted.
C. All pond outlet structure pipes shall have suitable gaskets to prevent
leakage and piping of water through the pond embankment.
D. All pipe outlets shall discharge onto a stone riprap blanket to prevent
erosion of soil. Riprap will be sized considering pipe exit velocities.
E. Controls shall be installed at initial stages of earthmoving and
otherwise as outlined in the staging of earthmoving activities section of
the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
F. The discharge of stormwater runoff shall be to a well-defined
drainagecourse which has a defined bed and bank. If stormwater runoff
cannot be discharged to a defined drainagecourse, documentation of
written permission from each downstream property owner shall be
provided for all properties between the source of discharge and the
defined drainagecourse.
A. Maintenance during development. Maintenance during development of
a project shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or landowner
and shall usually include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Removal of silt from all debris basins, traps or other structures or
measures when 40% of capacity is filled with silt.
(2) Disposal of collected silt in a manner which will not adversely affect
the environment.
(3) Periodic maintenance of temporary control facilities such as
replacement of straw bale dikes, straw filters or similar measures.
(4) Establishment or reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and
mulching or sodding of scoured areas where vegetation has not
been successfully established. A developer or landowner retains
this obligation as to property he or she has developed or improved
even if the proper season for "seeding" occurs initially sometime
after the project is otherwise completed in whole or as to a
particular phase.
(5) Installation of necessary controls sufficient to protect against
problems caused by storm events within design frequencies.
(6) Removal of all temporary measures upon completion of the project.
§ 173-14 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-15
1:252
B. After acceptance of the plan by the Township. In the event that the
Township accepts public improvements in the plan, except in cases
where an agreement between the developer and the Township has been
executed to the contrary, the maintenance shall be the responsibility of
the Township and shall include, where necessary:
(1) Mowing to maintain adequate stands of grass and to control weeds.
Chemical weed control may be used if state and Township
regulations are met. Selection of seed mixtures shall reflect the
type of maintenance desired by the Township.
(2) Removal of silt from all permanent structures which trap silt or
sediment to keep this material from building up in grassed
waterways and other permanent structures, thereby reducing their
capacity.
(3) Removal of trees and shrubs from pond embankments.
(4) Repair of animal burrows and removal of animals causing same.
C. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to inspect all permanent
facilities to see that corrective action is taken where necessary.
D. Stormwater facilities located on private property shall be maintained by
the owner or his agent; however, this does not relieve the owner or his
agent of the obligation to inspect his own facilities. The Township
reserves the right to enter upon private property to make periodic
reasonable inspections and to require the owner to take necessary
corrective actions. An easement shall be recorded granting access over
private property to the stormwater facilities.
E. The owner shall convey to the Township easements and/or rights-of-way
to assure access for periodic inspections by the Township and
maintenance if required.
F. The owner shall keep on file with the Township the name, address and
telephone number of the person or company responsible for
maintenance activities; in the event of a change, new information will
be submitted to the Township within 10 days of the change.
G. The owner shall establish any special maintenance funds or other
financing sources, in accordance with the approved maintenance plan.
H. The owner shall pay the amount due to the Special Stormwater Facility
Maintenance Fund.
(1) Persons installing stormwater storage facilities will be required to
pay a specified amount to the Brighton Township Stormwater
Facility Maintenance Fund to help defray the costs of periodic
inspections and annual maintenance expenses. The amount of the
deposit shall be determined as follows:
§ 173-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-15
1:253
(a) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained,
the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections
performed by the Township for a period of 10 years, as
estimated by the Township. After that period of time,
inspections will be performed by the Township and billed
directly to the owner.
(b) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Township, the deposit shall cover the estimated annual costs
for maintenance and inspections for 10 years, as estimated by
the Township.
(c) The amount of the deposit to the maintenance fund covering
annual inspection and maintenance costs shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The Township
Manager shall determine the present-worth equivalents, which
shall be subject to the final approval of the Township
Supervisors.
(2) If a storage facility is proposed which also serves as a recreation
facility, such as a lake or ballfield, the Township may reduce or
waive the amount of the maintenance fund based on the value of
the land for public recreation purposes.
(3) If, at some future time, any storage facility (whether publicly or
privately owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm
sewers or another storage facility (i.e., a distributed storage
facility), the unused portion of the maintenance fund will be applied
to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the storm
sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit remaining
after the costs of abandonment are paid will be returned to the
depositor.
I. If the owner fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities, following
due notice by the Township to correct the problems, the Township shall
perform the necessary maintenance or corrective work. The owner
shall reimburse the Township for all costs.
J. Additional items may be included in the maintenance agreement where
determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all
facilities. The maintenance agreement shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Township's Solicitor.
K. Post-construction stormwater record plan.
(1) Prior to issuance of an occupancy permit or utilization of the
proposed improvements, the applicant must provide the Township
a copy of a recorded post-constructed stormwater management
plan and the proof of recording for any project containing
stormwater management facilities, including storm sewers and
BMPs.

1:254
§ 173-16. Stormwater culverts.
Stormwater culverts, bridges and similar structures serving public streets,
access driveways or other vehicular rights-of-way shall be designed to
support HS-20 loading and any other imposed loadings necessary without
structurally damaging the drainage system. Stormwater culverts, bridges
or other structures which do not serve vehicular traffic shall be designed
to support the necessary loading without structurally damaging the pipe
or affecting its capacity for drainage. Said design shall be approved by the
Township Engineer and shall comply with the following requirements:
(2) The owner shall provide a digital file, on the state plane coordinate
system, of the location of all BMPs constructed on the property.
(3) An as-built drawing shall be required for each stormwater
detention facility constructed. The drawing shall represent
certification of the volume of the facility and the depth vs. storage
relationship, as well as the elevational relationships and
dimensions of flow controls, including emergency spillways, as
appropriate. These relationships shall be shown on the drawing in
table form or in report form. In the event that these relationships
vary from the computations provided in the approved plan, revised
storm routings may be required at the discretion of the Township.
The as-built drawing shall be stamped by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor and submitted to the Township within 60 days
of the completion of the facility. No facility will be approved until
this as-built drawing has been approved by the Township.
A. Conduit size of culverts and other enclosed components of a
stormwater drainage system shall be based on computed hydrologic
and hydraulic data, and computations shall be approved by the
Township. The minimum size of any enclosed structure to be
maintained by the Township shall be 15 inches in diameter. The
minimum size of any enclosed structure to be privately maintained shall
be 15 inches in diameter, unless the design calculations, approved by
the Township Engineer, justify a lesser size. In no case shall larger
pipes/culverts be connected to smaller pipes/culverts.
B. The design of any enclosed drainagecourse shall provide a minimum
cleaning velocity of two feet per second. When the design provides for a
maximum velocity greater than 10 feet per second, the enclosed
components shall be lined or protected to prevent scour.
C. The design of headwall and endwall structures for enclosed stormwater
facilities shall be approved by the Township and shall be in accordance
with the Township Construction Standards as provided in the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.52

1:255
§ 173-17. Open stormwater drainagecourses.
§ 173-18. Inspections of stormwater management controls during
construction.
D. Energy dissipaters shall be required at the outlet side of all enclosed
culverts or similar components and shall be designed in accordance
with the Township Construction Standards as provided in Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance.
E. The type of materials used for enclosed culverts and similar
components shall comply with the Township Construction Standards as
provided in Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. No
stormwater facility shall be enclosed or covered over until the Township
has field-reviewed the construction.
F. Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel to or
close to the top or bottom of major embankments to avoid the
possibility of embankment failure, with the exception of those facilities
specifically designed to prohibit stormwater runoff from eroding slopes
or prevent runoff from damaging downstream properties.
A. Open stormwater drainagecourses shall be designed for a maximum
velocity not to exceed 10 feet per second and a minimum velocity of five
feet per second. A minimum velocity of one foot per second may be
authorized by the Township Engineer where a greater slope cannot be
achieved to permit the standard required minimum velocity. An open
stormwater drainagecourse shall include a lining (riprap, concrete or
bituminous) to prevent erosion. The applicant shall obtain approval
from the BCCD service, if required.
B. Permissible velocities of various channel linings (vegetation, rock lined,
riprap, gabions) shall be in accordance with Chapter 4 of the Erosion
and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual published by the
PADEP. Storm sewer outfall channels shall be trapezoidal or triangular
shape with side slopes not to exceed two horizontal to one vertical
(ratio). Storm sewer outfall channels shall be designed in accordance
with Chapter 13 of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Design Manual Part 2 - Publication 13, Section 13.3, titled "Watercourse
Erosion Protection." Where drainage swales or open channels are used,
they shall be suitably designed for ease of maintenance.
A. The Township or a designated representative shall field-review the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater management
facilities for the development site. The permittee shall notify the
Township 48 hours in advance of the completion of the following key
development phases:
(1) At the completion of the preliminary site preparation, including
stripping of vegetation, stockpiling of topsoil and construction of
temporary stormwater management and erosion control facilities.
§ 173-16 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-18
1:256
§ 173-19. Requirements for erosion and sediment controls.
(2) At the completion of rough grading but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvement and
ground covers.
(3) During construction of the permanent stormwater facilities at such
times as specified by the Township.
(4) On completion of permanent stormwater management facilities,
including established ground covers and plantings.
(5) On completion of any final grading, vegetative control measures or
other site restoration work done in accordance with the approved
plan and permit.
B. No work shall commence on any subsequent phase until the preceding
one has been field-reviewed by the Township's Engineer and approved
by the Township in writing. If there are deficiencies in any phase, the
Township shall issue a written description of the required corrections
and stipulate the time by which the corrections must be made.
C. If, during construction, the contractor or permittee identifies any site
conditions, such as subsurface soil conditions or alterations in surface
or subsurface drainage, which could affect the feasibility of the
approved stormwater facilities, said person must notify the Township
within 24 hours of the discovery of such condition and request a field
review by the Township. The Township shall determine if the condition
requires a stormwater plan modification.
D. In cases where stormwater facilities are to be installed in areas of
landslide-prone soils or where other special site conditions exist, the
Township may require special precautions, such as soil tests and core
borings, full-time resident project representative services and/or
similar measures. All costs of any such measures shall be borne by the
permittee.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
B. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has
regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan for any
earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa.
Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for any earth disturbance of one acre of
more with a point-source discharge to surface waters or the Township's
storm sewer system, or five acres or more regardless of the planned
runoff (hereinafter collectively referred to as "regulated earth
disturbance activities"). This includes earth disturbance on any portion
§ 173-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-19
1:257
§ 173-20. Post-construction runoff control requirements.
of, part of, or during any stage of, a larger common plan of
development.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or BCCD must be
provided to the Township. The issuance of an NPDES construction
permit. [or permit coverage under the statewide general permit
(PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of Subsection A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by PADEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
F. Measures shall be designed and used during construction as per
approved plans from the BCCD and in accordance with the details
presented in the PA DEP Chapter 102 Revised Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Program Manual. The following DEP
construction details shall be included and made a part of the
construction plans:
(1) Silt barrier fence.
(2) Rock construction entrance.
(3) Diversion swale.
(4) Sediment trap outlet.
(5) Rock filter.
(6) Sediment basin.
(7) Soil erosion matting.
G. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or Beaver County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township. The issuance
of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the
statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements
Subsection A.
H. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. Post-construction stormwater runoff controls for new development and
redevelopment, including operations and maintenance of stormwater
BMPs:
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan which
§ 173-19 BRIGHTON CODE § 173-20
1:258
§ 173-21. Sanctions.
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
after construction is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and maintain the
level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in "special protection"
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
(3) To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated
earth disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff
conditions, so that post-construction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (No. 392-0300-002, September 28,
2002), as amended, this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(c) Stream bank and stream bed protection: management of
volume and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to
prevent physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from
scouring and erosion).
B. DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of best management practices
("BMPs") that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
(hereinafter "development") after regulated earth disturbance activities
are complete. These requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations
and maintenance of those BMPs.
C. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate PADEP regional office or Beaver County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township. The issuance
of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the
statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of
Subsection A.
A. Public nuisance.

ARTICLE II
Storm Sewers and Drainage Facilities
§ 173-22. Stormwater collection and conveyance.
A. Applicants are encouraged to design conveyance systems that
encourage infiltration and improve water quality wherever practicable.
B. Wherever conveyance channels are necessary, drainage shall be
maintained by an open channel with landscape banks designed to carry
the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. If the runoff from stormwater collection
and conveyance facilities would drain over land to a stormwater
detention facility, the twenty-five-year frequency storm event may be
used. The Township Engineer, with the approval of the Township, may
increase the design storm as conditions require. All open channels shall
be designed with one foot of freeboard above the design water surface
elevation of the design runoff condition.
C. Flood relief channels shall be provided and designed to convey the
runoff from the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm such that a

The Board of Supervisors of Brighton Township finds that:
§ 173-30. Purpose.
The purpose of this Part 2 is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Township and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 173-29 of this Part, through provisions designed
to:
A. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood-control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases pollution of water
resources.
B. Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal
separate storm sewer systems is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth,
their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated
small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s).
A. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
B. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
§ 173-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-30
1:269
§ 173-31. Statutory authority.
The Township also is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.56
§ 173-32. Applicability.
All activities related to proper operation and maintenance of approved
stormwater management BMPs and all activities that may contribute
nonstormwater discharges to a regulated small MS4 are subject to
regulation by this Part 2.
§ 173-33. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Township inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this Part 2 is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
§ 173-34. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Part 2 invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this Part.
§ 173-35. Compatibility with other requirements.
Actions taken under this Part 2 do not affect any responsibility, permit or
approval for any activity regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or
ordinance.
§ 173-36. Definitions.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds.
F. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all facilities and all
stormwater management best management practices (SWM BMPs) that
are implemented within the Township.

structure(s) from each side: [Amended 6-11-2007 by Ord. No. 153]
(1) Structure design and orientation.
(a) Purpose: In the evaluation of an application for land
development approval, basic structural design components
shall be considered in conjunction with other characteristics of
the use. Monotony of design in single or multiple building
projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, positioning
and landscaping shall be used to provide visual interest and to:
70.Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 180-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-12
1:329
[1] Create a comfortably scaled commercial or nonresidential
environment.
[2] Establish an organized variety of building heights and
mass.
[3] Encourage buildings that are similar in scale to adjacent
buildings.
[4] Foster a coherent architectural aesthetic design.
[5] Construct all additions, alterations, and accessory
buildings compatible in design and materials with the
principal structure.
(b) Building scale. The apparent mass, bulk and scale of large
buildings on the elevations visible from the public right-of-way
and pedestrian routes and entries shall be reduced through the
use of such methods as facade modulation and articulation,
architectural detailing, roof treatment, colors, materials and
other special features.
[1] Integration. Commercial buildings should integrate
features along their facades visible from the public rightof-
way and pedestrian routes and entries to reduce the
apparent building mass and achieve an architectural scale
consistent with other nearby structures.
[2] Facade modulation. Building facades visible from public
streets and public spaces should be stepped back or
projected forward at intervals to provide a minimum
facade modulation of 40%. The minimum depth of
modulation shall be one foot and the minimum width shall
be five feet. See Figure 1: Building Scale Criteria,
Modulation. Modulation is the stepping back or projecting
forward of the facade in intervals. Facade modulation and
pitched roofs help reduce the apparent bulk of the
building.
Modulation
Figure 1: Building Scale Criteria, Modulation
Modulation is the stepping back or projecting
forward of the facade in intervals.
[3] Articulation. To break up building mass, buildings shall be
articulated to reduce the apparent scale of buildings and
§ 180-12 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-12
1:330
to convey visual interest. Building mass should be varied
both horizontally and vertically by varying articulation
dimensions such as height, depth and width. Architectural
details that are used to articulate the structure may
include reveals, patterns, and other three-dimensional
details that create shadow lines and break up the flat
surfaces of the facade. See Figure 2: Building Scale
Criteria, Articulation. Articulation can be achieved with
other building elements such as the roofline, windows and
entries.
Articulation
Figure 2: Building Scale Criteria, Articulation
Articulation can be achieved with other building
elements such as the roofline, windows and entries.
[4] Architectural elements. The mass of long or large-scale
buildings can be made more visually interesting by
incorporating architectural elements such as arcades,
balconies, bay windows, dormers, and/or columns.
[5] Rooflines. A distinctive roofline can reduce perceived
building height and mass, increase compatibility with
smaller scale development, and add interest to the overall
design of a building. Change the roofline by alternating
dormers, stepped roofs, gables, or other roof elements to
reinforce the modulation or articulation interval. Roofs
that incorporate a variety of vertical dimensions such as
multilanes and intersecting rooflines are encouraged. Flatroofed
designs shall include architectural details such a
cornices, and decorative facings to provide interest to the
roofline.
(c) Exterior facade colors shall be of low reflectance, subtle,
neutral or earth tone colors. For exterior walls with a main
entry, street frontage or fronting a parking area for public use
two or more materials shall be used. Exterior walls shall be
constructed of the following materials. (NOTE: Comparable
materials may be accepted by the Planning Commission and
approved by the Board of Supervisors.)
[1] Brick, stone, cast stone, rock, marble, granite, glass block,
tile;
[2] Stucco or plaster;
§ 180-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-12
1:331
[3] Exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS);
[4] Metal (for beams, lintels, trim elements and ornaments);
[5] Glass with reflectance of less than 20% (however, only a
maximum of 50% of the total area of the building may be
constructed in glass);
[6] Split face concrete block, poured-in-place concrete, and
tilt-wall concrete. Any use of concrete products shall have
integrated color and be textured or patterned. Tilt-wall
concrete structures shall have reveals, punch-outs, or
similar surface characteristics to enhance the facade on at
least 10% of each facade; or
[7] Sheet metal or vinyl siding shall not extend to grade and is
recommended only above the ground floor.
(d) Mechanical equipment attached to the exterior or roof of a
building should be kept low and placed where they are not
visible from the front facade.
(e) Ground-mounted mechanical equipment should be screened
with a fence or plant materials or housed in a structure
compatible in design and materials with the principal
structure.
(2) Screening. A buffer yard or landscape screen as outlined in
§ 195-137.1 of the Township Zoning Ordinance shall be provided
and maintained on any property in a commercial or industrial
district which is contiguous to any residential district or residential
land use, except where natural or physical barriers exist which are
deemed adequate by the Planning Commission, and except where
such contiguity has resulted from an amendment to the zoning
district boundaries after the passage of this section. This buffer
yard screen shall be composed of plants and evergreen trees
arranged to form both as low-level and a high-level screen
consistent with the provisions of § 195-137.1 of the Township
Zoning Ordinance.
(3) Landscaping and beautification. Any part or portion of the site
which is not used for building, other structures, loading or parking
spaces and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be
planted and maintained with an all-season ground cover and shall
be landscaped with trees and shrubs in accordance with an overall
landscape plan as per the provisions of § 195-137.1 of the Township
Zoning Ordinance, and shall be in keeping with natural
surroundings. Any off-street parking area with five or more spaces
located between the front building line and the right-of-way line
shall include at least 50% of all required planting or landscaping in
addition to the planting required within one of the buffer yards as
outlined in § 195-137.1 of the Township Zoning Ordinance. The
§ 180-12 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-12
1:332
parking area shall be graded for proper drainage and paved, and
at least one deciduous shade tree, of at least two-inch caliper, shall
be provided per five parking spaces, planted to a height of six feet
or more at intervals of no greater than 10 feet, or portions thereof
located adjacent to the parking area, which shall be landscaped, to
include a low-level screen consisting of shrubs or hedges planted
at an initial height of not less than two feet in alternating rows. A
maximum of 70% of the total area of a parcel may be covered with
an impervious surface.
(4) Storage. Any article or material stored outside an enclosed building
as an incidental part of the primary commercial or industrial
operation shall be so screened by opaque ornamental fencing, walls
or a mix of deciduous and evergreen planting, in addition to the
planting, required in buffer yards as outlined in § 195-137.1 of the
Township Zoning Ordinance, that it cannot be seen when viewed by
a person standing on the berm of all abutting streets during any
season of the year. All organic rubbish or storage shall be contained
in airtight, vermin-proof containers which shall also be screened
from public view.
(5) Lighting. All parking areas, driveways and loading areas shall be
provided with a lighting system in accordance with an approved
lighting plan. All lighting fixtures used shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission and shall not exceed 35 feet
in height. All lighting shall be completely shielded from traffic on
any public right-of-way and from any residential district or
residential land use.
(6) Interior circulation. The interior circulation of traffic and
commercial and industrial areas shall be designated so that no
driveway or access lane providing parking spaces shall be used as a
through street.
(7) Loading areas. Areas provided for loading and unloading of
delivery trucks and other vehicles and for the servicing of
businesses by refuse collections, fuel and other service vehicles
shall be located at the side or rear of all buildings, shall not face a
street, shall be adequate in size and shall be so arranged that they
may be used without blockage or interference with the use of
accessway or automobile parking facilities.
(8) Emergency access.
(a) The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning Commission that all buildings shown on a land
development plan can be adequately accessed by emergency
fire-fighting vehicles and other emergency equipment.
Emergency access shall be required for the purpose of
positioning fire-fighting equipment or other emergency
vehicles in relation to the building so that the equipment can
§ 180-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-12
1:333
be effectively used. Emergency access may be provided by
means of a fire lane, a public or private street a driveway or
aisle in a parking area or an unobstructed landscaped area.
(b) Emergency access shall be provided on at least one side of
each building. The Planning Commission may require
emergency access to be provided on more than one side of a
building, if warranted by site conditions, public safety and the
layout of the land development plan.
(c) In the event that any applicant disagrees with the
determination of the Planning Commission regarding the
provision of emergency access, the applicant may appeal that
determination to the Board of Supervisors for consideration
prior to final action.
(9) Access driveways and streets.
(a) Neither any driveway nor any junction or intersection of any
streets shall be located within:
[1] Two hundred fifty feet of the end of any interstate highway
ramp;
[2] One hundred fifty feet of the intersection of the right-ofway
center lines of any state or local highway and any road
intersection therewith.
(b) All street rights-of-way and pavement designs shall conform to
the requirements adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
(10) Traffic control. No proposed street or roadway configuration shall
be approved which is likely to create substantial traffic hazards
endangering the public safety, nor which is inconsistent with the
recommendations and findings of any officially adopted Township
traffic study. Traffic control devices may include traffic signals,
overhead flashing lights and delineators, such as medial barriers,
and not be limited to acceleration and deceleration lanes, turning
lanes, one-way traffic flow, traffic and lane markings and signs. The
plan for traffic signals shall include a traffic impact analysis. Said
analysis shall document expected impacts on adjacent intersections
as per the provisions of new § 195-137.2 of the Township's Zoning
Ordinance. The developer shall be responsible for the construction
of any such traffic control device.
(11) Stormwater management. Adequate stormwater drainage facilities
shall be installed in conformance with a stormwater management
plan, based on adopted Township guidelines and regulations, to
ensure that stormwater does not flow onto abutting property,
sidewalks or streets in such quantities as to cause detrimental
effect. The stormwater management plan shall ensure to the
satisfaction of the Township that rates of runoff after development
§ 180-12 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-12
1:334
shall not be greater than the runoff which would occur on the site
in its natural state.
(12) The Planning Commission may recommend land development
approval for a single-family dwelling unit in the HC-1, C-1, or C-2
District on a lot which meets all of the requirements of municipal
ordinances in effect at the time of recording of the plat and which is
now so bounded or limited by other developed lots that it has no
utility as a commercial or other permitted use in those designated
districts and which development approval would not conflict with
the purpose of those districts. The Township Supervisors shall issue
final approval for such land development.
(13) Signs. Every existing nonconforming sign shall be removed prior to
the initial occupancy of any or all buildings proposed.
F. Planning Commission review and action; preliminary applications.
(1) The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plats and
prepare a written report for the Board of Supervisors. The report
shall contain recommendations for approval, conditional approval
or disapproval with specific reasons for the recommended action.

arterial street, the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors may
require local access streets, reverse frontage lots or such other
treatment which will provide protection for abutting properties,
reduction in the number of intersections with arterial streets and
separation of local and through traffic.
E. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of this part and where, in addition,

ARTICLE VIII
Open Space, Recreation Land and Facilities
§ 180-62. Location of common open space.
The common open space shall be located so as to be consistent with good
design principles for land use. Where possible, it shall be designed as a
contiguous area easily accessible to the residents and preserving natural
features.
§ 180-63. Ownership of common open space.
§ 180-64. Homeowners' association.
Where commonly owned open space is proposed and the Township of
Brighton has indicated that it will not accept such land, a homeowners'
association or open space trust shall be formed and be governed according
to the following regulations:
A. There shall be provisions which ensure that the common open space
land shall continue as such and be properly maintained. The developer
shall either:
(1) Dedicate such land to public use if the Township or another public
agency has indicated it will accept such dedication;
(2) Retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such open
space land; or
(3) Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.
B. In the case of Subsection A(3) above, each organization shall be a
nonprofit homeowner corporation, unless the developer demonstrates
that a community open space trust is a more appropriate form of
organization.
A. The organization is organized by the developer and operated with
financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary before the sale of
any lots within the development. At such time that 25% of the parcels in
the development have been built upon and occupied, the organization
shall become active through the election of a Board of Directors.
B. Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
homes therein and their successors.
C. The organization shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance and
taxes on common open space.
D. The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance with
procedures established by them.
§ 180-62 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-64
1:375
§ 180-64.1. Public recreation land and facilities. [Added 12-12-2005
by Ord. No. 146]
E. The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
F. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain a
common open space or any successor organization shall at any time
after establishment of the homeowners' association fail to maintain the
common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance
with the development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the development
setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to
maintain the common open space in reasonable condition, and said
notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be
cured within 30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a
hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which
they shall be cured.
A. Purpose. The Brighton Township Recreation Land and Facilities
Program is established to provide all Township residents with land and
recreation facilities based on the Recreation Plan and the Township
Comprehensive Plan. The required dedication of public recreation land
or the payment of fees-in-lieu-of-dedication of public recreation land is
based on the standards set forth in the Recreation Plan, Part V.
B. A minimum of 2,533 square feet of public recreation land shall be
dedicated for each dwelling unit proposed in a residential subdivision
or land development and shall be identified on the final plat.
C. Land to be dedicated for public recreation land shall meet the following
minimum standards:
(1) Land shall provide recreation opportunities to all residents of the
Township, with reasonable access to the proposed public
recreation area;
(2) Land shall be centrally located within the development site, on one
tract of land and with no intervening land;
(3) Land shall be accessible to each dwelling unit proposed, whether
singly or in combination with other units in a residential
subdivision or land, via pedestrian easements or dedicated rightsof-
way within which sidewalks can be designed and built, and to all
other dwelling units off site with reasonable access to the
development via public rights-of-way.
(4) Land shall be graded to a maximum of 3% slope;
§ 180-64 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-64.1
1:376
(5) Land shall have public utilities, including water, sanitary sewer and
electric service, when such development includes the provisions of
such utilities;
(6) Land shall be free from any encumbrances or liens which would
prevent, limit or restrict its use in any way for recreational
purposes.
(7) Land shall not include areas defined as wetlands by either the Army
Corps of Engineers or the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection;
(8) Land shall be seeded and otherwise ready to be used for
recreational purposes in full compliance with all other provisions of
this section within six months of occupancy of the first dwelling
unit in a residential development;
(9) Land shall be a minimum size of three acres (Recreation Plan, Part
V). Where the aggregate area of land to be dedicated on a perdwelling-
unit (or per-household) basis would result in less than
three acres because of the number of lots being created, the
developer or applicant has the following options:
(a) Supplement the minimum per-dwelling-unit ratio dedication in
order to meet the three-acre minimum; or
(b) Pay the per-dwelling-unit fee-in-lieu-of-dedication.
(10) Land shall be capable of achieving the Township's recreation and
open space objectives as set forth in the Brighton Township
Comprehensive Plan, as adopted by the Brighton Township
Supervisors in 1999.
(11) Land shall be suitable for recreational uses, as described in the
Recreation Plan.
D. In-lieu-of-dedication of public recreation land, the developer or
applicant shall pay a fee of $612.46, as calculated per Exhibit #V-9 in
the Recreation Plan, or such other amount as the Supervisors may
hereafter declare by resolution, for each dwelling unit proposed at the
time of final approval. This fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a
building and zoning permit for the construction of any dwelling unit,
and such fees shall comply with the provisions of § 180-78.
E. Subdivisions of three or fewer lots and land developments of three or
fewer units shall not be required to dedicate public recreation land.

ARTICLE IX
Condition of Acceptance
§ 180-65. Performance requirements.
§ 180-66. Performance guaranties. [Amended 9-9-2013 by Ord. No.
184]
The Board of Supervisors shall ensure, through receipt of certificates of
compliance submitted and attested by the Township Engineer, that required
improvements have been installed according to the specifications of the
final plat or alternately require the posting of adequate surety to cover
the cost for such improvements. The Board of Supervisors shall approve
one of the following alternatives for guaranteeing compliance with the
requirements of this section for the subdivider requesting final approval
of a plat. Final approval of a plat shall not be granted until the surety
required is fully provided. The amount of financial security to be posted for
the completion of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled
for completion by the subdivider. The amount estimated shall be prepared
by a licensed professional engineer for submittal to the Township by the
applicant or subdivider. If the amount of the estimated financial security
is contested by the Township of Brighton Engineer, a third licensed
professional engineer chosen mutually by the applicant or subdivider and
the Township shall estimate the amount of financial security necessary,
which estimate shall be presumed fair and reasonable. Fees for the services
of the third engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant
or subdivider.
A. Before approving any subdivision plan, the Board of Supervisors shall
require a written agreement that necessary grading, paving and street
improvements, sidewalks, streetlights, fire hydrants, water mains and
sanitary sewers, as may be required by the Township, shall be installed
by the subdivider in strict accordance with the design standards and
specifications of the Township, within a specified time period. Such
agreement shall be prepared by the Township Solicitor at the expense
of the developer.
B. When requested by the developer in order to facilitate financing, the
Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining satisfactory financial security. The final plat shall
not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement
is executed. If within 90 days, unless written extension is granted by the
Board of Supervisors, the financial improvement agreement is not
executed, then the resolution or letter of contingent approval shall
expire.
A. Completion of improvements prior to final approval. Prior to final plat
approval, the subdivider shall complete, in a manner satisfactory to the
§ 180-65 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-66
1:379
Board of Supervisors and the Township Engineer, all improvements
required in these regulations specified in the final subdivision plat and
as approved by the Board of Supervisors and shall dedicate the same to
the Township in accordance with these regulations. Final plat approval
shall not be granted until the dedication of said improvements has been
accepted by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Guaranty of future performance. In lieu of requiring the completion of
all improvements prior to final plat approval, the Township may, at its
discretion, enter into a contract with the subdivider whereby the
subdivider shall guarantee to complete all improvements required by
this part or otherwise specified by the Board of Supervisors in a manner
satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors. To secure this contract, the
subdivider shall provide, subject to the approval of the Board of
Supervisors, one of the following guaranties:
(1) Surety bond. The subdivider shall obtain a surety bond from a
surety bonding company authorized to do business in the State of
Pennsylvania. The bond shall be payable to the Township and shall
be in an amount sufficient to cover the entire cost, as estimated by
the Township Engineer, as herein provided, for the installation of
all improvements, plus 10%. The duration of the bond shall be until
such time as the improvements are accepted by the Township in
accordance with the requirements of this part.
(2) Escrow account. The subdivider shall deposit cash or other
instruments readily convertible into cash at face value, either with
the Township or in escrow with a bank. The form of any instruments
other than cash and, in the case of an escrow account, the bank
with which the funds are to be deposited shall be subject to the
approval of the Township Solicitor. The amount of the deposit shall
be at least equal to the cost, as estimated by the Township
Engineer, of installing all required improvements, plus 10%. In case
of an escrow account, the subdivider shall file with the Board of
Supervisors an agreement between the financial bank and himself
guaranteeing the following:
(a) That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in trust
until released by the Board of Supervisors and may not be used
or pledged by the subdivider as security in any other matter
during the period; and
(b) That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete said improvements, the bank shall immediately make
the funds in said account available to the Township for use in
the completion of those improvements.
(3) Irrevocable letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit in an
amount equal to the cost of all required improvements, as
estimated by the Township Engineer, plus 10%, shall be posted
naming the Township Board of Supervisors as beneficiaries. The
§ 180-66 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-66
1:380
§ 180-67. Procedure for release from improvement bond; fees.
financial institution which provides the irrevocable letter of credit
shall be first approved by the Township Board of Supervisors.
Failure on the part of the subdivider to complete said
improvements shall cause the funds posted as an irrevocable letter
of credit to be more available to the Township upon written notice
of a claim against said funds.
A. When the developer has completed all of the required improvements,
the developer shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the required
improvements and shall send a copy to the Township Engineer.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of such
notice, direct and authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements. The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a
report, in writing, with the Board of Supervisors and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail.
The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board of
Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
C. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, in writing by
certified or registered mail, within 15 days of receipt of the engineer's
report of the action of said Board of Supervisors with relation thereto.
D. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be
released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond.
E. If any portion of the required improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
F. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
subdivider's or developer's right to contest or question, by legal
proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Board of
Supervisors or the Township Engineer.
G. The applicant shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred in connection with the inspection of
improvements. The applicant shall not be required to reimburse the
Board of Supervisors for any inspection which is duplicative of
inspections conducted by other governmental agencies or public
§ 180-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-67
1:381
utilities. The burden of proving that any inspection is duplicative shall
be upon the objecting applicant. Such reimbursement shall be based
upon a schedule established by resolution. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees
charged by the Township's professional consultant for work performed
for similar services in the community, but in no event shall the fees
exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional consultant to the
Township for comparable services when fees are not reimbursed or
otherwise imposed on applicants. [Amended 9-9-2013 by Ord. No.
184]
(1) The Board of Supervisors shall submit to the applicant an itemized
bill showing the work performed in connection with the inspection
of improvements performed, identifying the person performing the
services and the time and date spent for each task. In the event the
applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection
with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, no later
than 100 days after the date of transmittal of a bill for inspection
services, notify the Township and the Township's professional
consultant that such inspection expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary and shall explain the basis of their
objections to the fees charged. The Township shall not delay or
disapprove a request for release of financial security, a subdivision
or land development application or any approval or permit related
to development due to the applicant's dispute of inspection
expenses. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within 100 days
shall be a waiver of the applicant's right to arbitration of that bill
under this section.
(2) Subsequent to the final release of financial security for completion
of improvements for a subdivision or land development or any
phase thereof, the professional consultant shall submit to the Board
of Supervisors a bill for inspection services, specifically designated
as a final bill, which the Board of Supervisors shall submit to the
applicant. The final bill shall include inspection fees incurred
through the release of financial security.
(3) If the professional consultant and the applicant cannot agree on the
amount of expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the
applicant shall have the right, within 100 days of the transmittal of
the final bill or supplement to the final bill to the applicant, to
request the appointment of another professional consultant to
serve as an arbitrator. The applicant and the professional
consultant whose fees are being challenged shall, by mutual
agreement, appoint another professional consultant to review any
bills the applicant has disputed and which remain unsolved and
make a determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary. The arbitrator shall be of the same profession as the
professional consultant whose fees are being challenged.
§ 180-67 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-67
1:382
(4) The arbitrator so appointed shall hear such evidence and review
such documentation as the arbitrator in his or her sole opinion
deems necessary and shall render a decision no later than 50 days
after the date of appointment. Based on the decision of the
arbitrator, the applicant or the professional consultant whose fees
were challenged shall be required to pay any amounts necessary to
implement the decision within 60 days. In the event the Township
has paid the professional consultant an amount in excess of the
amount determined to be reasonable and necessary, the
professional consultant shall within 60 days reimburse the excess
payment.
(5) In the event the Township's professional consultant and the
applicant cannot agree upon the arbitrator to be appointed within
20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, then, upon
application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of
Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the Township is
located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the
senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such arbitrator, who,
in that case, shall be neither the Township's professional consultant
nor any professional consultant who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Township or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
(6) The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the applicant if the
disputed fee is upheld by the arbitrator. The fee of the arbitrator
shall be paid by the charging party if the disputed fee is $2,500 or
greater than the payment decided by the arbitrator. The fee of the
arbitrator shall be paid in an equal amount by the applicant and the
charging party if the disputed fee is less than $2,500 of the
payment decided by the arbitrator.
(7) In the event that the disputed fees have been paid and the
arbitrator finds that the disputed fees are unreasonable or
excessive by more than $10,000, the arbitrator shall:
(a) Award the amount of the fees found to be unreasonable or
excessive to the party that paid the disputed fee; and
(b) Impose a surcharge of 4% of the amount found as
unreasonable or excessive to be paid to the party that paid the
disputed fee.
(8) The Township or an applicant shall have 100 days after paying a fee
to dispute any fee charged as being unreasonable or excessive.
H. At the time of final approval and prior to the issuance of any required
Township permit, a ten-percent deposit shall be made by the applicant
with the Township for the costs of review and inspection where public
utilities and facilities are proposed. Said 10% shall be calculated as
10% of the total costs of installation of said public utilities and facilities.
§ 180-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-67
1:383
§ 180-68. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
§ 180-69. Maintenance bond.
Any funds unexpended at the time of acceptance of the aforementioned
public utilities and facilities shall be returned to the applicant.
A. In the event that any improvements which may be required have not
been constructed and installed as provided for in the written
agreement, this part and the requirements of the Board of Supervisors
or in accord with the approved final plan, the Board of Supervisors shall
enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies.
B. If proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the
cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may,
at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the
subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or
equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the
remainder of the improvements.
C. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be
used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security and not for any other municipal purpose.
A. Before the Township Engineer shall issue to the Board of Supervisors a
written certification that all improvements specified and required have
been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the agreement and
requirements relative to the land development and in compliance with
the specifications, standards, ordinances and requirements of the
Township, the subdivider or developer shall be required to deposit with
the Township a corporate maintenance bond, in such amount, under
such conditions, in such form and with approved surety as shall be
required by the Board of Supervisors. The maintenance bond shall
guarantee the repairs and maintenance by the subdivider or developer
of the streets, roads, pavement, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, stormwater
drains and facilities, sanitary sewer and facilities and any other
improvements constructed and installed in the subdivision or
development, for a period of 18 months from the date of final and
official acceptance of the above said improvements and facilities by the
Board of Supervisors. The amount of the maintenance bond shall not
exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
B. The repairs and maintenance required to be performed by the
subdivider or developer shall extend only to making good any inherent
defects which become manifested in the materials and workmanship
under ordinary conditions and shall not be held to cover any breakage
or damage caused by improper use or by accident resulting from
circumstances over which the subdivider or developer has no control.
§ 180-67 BRIGHTON CODE § 180-70
1:384
§ 180-70. Acceptance of public improvements.
Upon completion of the inspection and approval of the public
improvements, the developer shall submit a request to the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, to accept the dedication of the public
improvements. The request for acceptance shall include deeds of dedication
and all other legal descriptive documents necessary to prepare a resolution
or ordinance and shall be submitted at least 20 days prior to the regular
meeting of the Board of Supervisors. At the regular meeting, the Board
of Supervisors shall enact a resolution or ordinance accepting the public
improvements as part of the Township's public facilities, subject to the
posting of the maintenance bond required by this part.
§ 180-71. Final inspection of public improvements.
Prior to the end of the eighteen-month period when the maintenance bond
expires and before the maintenance bond is released, the Township
Engineer shall make a final inspection and certify in writing to the Board
of Supervisors that all the public improvements are in good order. If any
repairs are required or maintenance needed, the subdivider shall be notified
in writing and such repairs or maintenance shall be done and approved
prior to certification by the Township Engineer.
§ 180-72. Snowplowing.
The applicant shall be responsible from the time there is at least one
occupant in the proposed development to plow snow on development roads
as may be necessary to provide ingress and egress to the occupants at the
applicant's cost, prior to the acceptance of dedicated streets. The applicant
shall post with the Township the sum of $2,500 as an escrow to provide for
snow removal prior to acceptance of dedication of the streets. The applicant
simultaneously shall present a contract with a snow removal firm indicating
that the firm has been contracted to remove snow from the development
streets within four hours after snow has stopped falling. All payments for
said snow removal shall be made from the escrow fund. In the event that the
escrow should become depleted, the applicant shall post an additional sum
of $2,500 and such further amounts as may be necessary until such time as
the dedication of the streets is accepted by the Township. In the event that
the applicant or the snow removal firm does not perform in accordance with
the contract presented, the Township may hire contractors to perform the
necessary work and pay those contractors from the escrow fund.
§ 180-73. Higher standards.
A. No road, street, land, way or related improvement shall be accepted as

(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that

from the effective date of this article during the year 1987 and thereafter,

B.
§ 184-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 184-28
1:449
from year to year on a calendar-year basis. No person shall engage in such
business without complying with all of the provisions of this article and
paying the tax hereby levied.
§ 184-29. Returns and payments.
§ 184-30. Calculation of gross receipts.
In calculating the gross receipts from the sanitary landfill business, the
operator shall include the total consideration received from the inside
customers and shall include such portion of the consideration received from
outside customers as shall be allocated to landfill receipts pursuant to the
following section.
§ 184-31. Allocation of receipts.
Where a landfill operator performs substantial off-the-premises services,
such as collection or transportation of disposable material for a customer,
an allocation of the total consideration paid by the customer shall be made
so as to impose the tax levied by this article on the on-site operations as
follows:
A. Each operator, upon forms prescribed by the Treasurer, shall file on or
before January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each calendar
year, returns showing gross receipts received with respect to each
sanitary landfill during the respective three-month period ending on the
last day of the month preceding the month in which the return due date
occurs. At the time of filing the return, the operator shall pay to the
Treasurer of the Township all tax due for the period to which the return
applies.
B. The initial return of gross receipts received and tax due under this
article shall be due on or before April 30, 1987, and shall cover the
period of February 15, 1987, through March 31, 1987.
C. Any operator who, for the preceding quarterly period, has failed to pay
over the proper amount of tax to the Township Treasurer may be
required by the Treasurer to file subsequent returns and pay the tax
monthly. In such cases, payments of the tax shall be made to the
Treasurer on or before the last day of the month succeeding the month
for which the tax is due.

apply his standard unit rates to the quantity of material handled for
outside customers and allocate that sum to the landfill receipts for such

average standard unit rates charged by the other operators in the

Each operator shall maintain, separately with respect to each sanitary
landfill, complete and accurate records of all transaction, gross receipts,
contracts and landfill receipts. Each operator shall allow the Treasurer
and his designated employees and agents access to all such records and
evidence at all reasonable times and shall provide verification of the same,
as the Treasurer may require. The Treasurer and agents designated by him
are hereby authorized to examine the books, papers and records of each
operator in order to verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
has been made, to ascertain the tax due.
§ 184-33. Confidentiality.
Any information gained by the Treasurer, his agents or any other official or
agent of the Township pursuant to the administration of this article shall
be confidential and shall not be disclosed except for official purposes or in
accordance with proper judicial order or for purposes expressly authorized
by this article. The Treasurer and his agents shall have the duty to disclose
the average standard unit rates, on request, to any operator having a proper
use of them and any change in formula allowed by the Treasurer to any
operator shall be disclosed to all operators.
§ 184-34. Payment under protest.
The Treasurer is hereby authorized to accept payment under protest of any
taxes claimed by the Township in any case where the taxpayer disputes
the validity or amount of the Township's claim to tax. If it is thereafter
judicially determined that the Township has been overpaid, the amount of
the overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer.
C. If the applicable formula set forth in Subsection A or B does not fairly
allocate the total receipts between an operator's landfill operation and
his other services, such operator shall present satisfactory evidence
thereof to the tax collector. If the Treasurer is satisfied by such
evidence, he shall then establish a formula which does fairly allocate
such receipts, but, in such event, the Treasurer must notify all other
operators in Brighton Township and such other operators shall have the
option of having their receipts from outside customers allocated in the
same manner. The new formula shall be effective for the operator who
requested its establishment as of the date of his request and shall be
effective as of the same date for all other operators who notify the
Treasurer in writing of their election to have their receipts allocated
thereby within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Treasurer. If an
operator elects at some later time to have his receipts allocated
according to the new formula, his election shall be effective as of the
date the Treasurer receives his election in writing.
§ 184-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 184-35
1:451
§ 184-35. Collection of delinquent taxes.

tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% per year on the amount
of unpaid tax and an additional penalty of 1/2 of 1% per month shall be
added to the tax and collected. The taxpayer shall be liable for all costs of
collection.

Any person failing to comply with or violating any provisions of this article
shall, upon conviction thereof before a District Justice, be fined not more
than $300 and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, be committed
to the Beaver County Jail or Workhouse for a period not exceeding 30 days.

place where its functions are discharged.

payments for sickness and disability other than regular wages received
during a period of sickness, disability or retirement or payments arising
under workmen compensation acts, occupational disease acts and similar
legislation or payments commonly recognized as old age benefits,
retirement pay or pensions paid to persons retired from service after
reaching a specific age or after a stated period of employment or payments
commonly known as public assistance or unemployment compensation
payments by any governmental agency or payments to reimburse expenses
or payments made by employers or labor unions for wage and salary
supplemental programs, including but not limited to programs covering
hospitalization, sickness, disability or death, supplemental unemployment
benefits, strike benefits, social security and retirement.

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold

B(3).

Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township of Brighton, in consultation with the Collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Township of Brighton or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within Brighton Township, as well as those employers
situated outside Brighton Township, but who engage in business within
the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting
the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for
him within the political subdivision and making a return and payment
thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission, and whether or not all

share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.

year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 184-52B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.

Collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental
reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30, and January
31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records
from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December
31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on or before

as those terms are defined herein, within Brighton Township shall be
required to comply with this article and pay the tax due to the Collector on
or before the 30h day following the end of each quarter.
§ 184-57. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more
than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim
to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:

A. The development goals of the Township of Brighton Comprehensive
Plan include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Parks, recreation and quality of life.
(a) Goal: To ensure that there are sufficient public parks and
recreation facilities that are inviting, well-maintained, free
from vandalism, accessible to all residents and which meet the
current safety standards through the coordinated efforts of the
Township, municipal partnership, community groups,
businesses, the School District and individual volunteers.
(b) Goal: To encourage, support and promote community building
activities in order to foster a cohesive community identity.
(2) Community development.
(a) Goal: To promote quality development which capitalizes on the
Township's unique locational advantage and which respects
the natural landscape and existing character of the community.
(b) Goal: To build upon the strengths of the Township's existing
residential housing base, stable neighborhoods and unique
bedroom community character.
(3) Transportation. Goal: To improve the safety and flow of pedestrian
and vehicular travel and to reduce the overall traffic congestion
while encouraging multiple modes of public/private transportation
that are conducive to the needs of the community.
(4) Community services facilities. Goal: To ensure that municipal
administration services and facilities are provided and coordinated
in an efficient and effective manner.
(5) Historical, cultural and natural resources. Goal: To preserve and
enhance the natural, scenic and historic areas of the community.

objectives of the Township of Brighton Comprehensive Plan include, but
are not limited to, the following:
§ 195-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-6
1:509
(1) Manage development in areas of steep slopes, poor soils,
floodplains, wetland and clay mining areas.
(2) Encourage the preservation of woodlands, unique views and
historical heritage.
(3) Encourage protection of the natural ground cover, minimize soil
erosion and siltation, and encourage proper methods of stormwater
drainage in development areas.
(4) Preserve the current blend of rural ambiance and single-family
detached development.
(5) Maintain the dominant land use theme of a bedroom community
with limited regional commercial and professional office uses.
(6) Develop specific design standards for adaptive reuse, infill projects
and facade improvements in key commercial, profession, and office
area.
(7) Maintain densities in the Township in harmony with the traditional
character of the area.
(8) Ensure that built features, zoning densities and recreation serve
the needs of the entire community (seniors, children and adults).
(9) Encourage the evolution of cohesive development areas with each
having a distinctive character and identity, by discouraging urban
sprawl in the form of scattered or strip development.
(10) Limit industrial development around the Route 60 interchange.
(11) Improve existing and future commercial nodes with streetlights,
landscaping, pedestrian paths, traffic control and other streetscape
amenities.
(12) Design new developments so that they contribute to, and have, a
relationship to the community as a whole. Site planning should be
accomplished by considering the elements of the site as well as the
site's relationship to surround parcels and street system.

§ 195-55. Location of common open space.
Common open spaces shall be distributed more or less equitably throughout
the planned residential development in relation to the dwelling units of
the people they are intended to serve and consistent with good design
principles. Common open spaces shall not be isolated in one corner of the
planned residential development, but shall be accessible to all dwelling
units in the plan.

area which includes phases already finally approved and the phase for
which final approval is being sought exceeds by more than 10% the
gross density allowed for the entire planned residential development in
the tentatively approved plan. Where it is necessary to allocate open
space to early phases to avoid exceeding the maximum gross residential
density, the developer will be required to establish said open space in
the manner prescribed in the tentative approval.
A. There shall be provisions which ensure that the common open space
land shall continue as such and be properly maintained. The developer
shall either:
(1) Dedicate such land to public use if the Township or another public
agency has indicated it will accept such dedication;
(2) Retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such open
space land; or
(3) Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.

nonprofit homeowners' corporation, unless the developer demonstrates
that a community open space trust is a more appropriate form of
organization.
A. If a homeowners' association or open space trust is formed, it shall be
governed according to the following regulations:
(1) The association is organized by the developer and operating with
financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary before the

common facilities and maintain the common open space.
(6) Articles of incorporation of the homeowners' association shall be
recorded simultaneously with the recording of the initial phase
receiving final approval.
B. In the event that the association established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the planned residential development fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the development plan, the Township may serve written
notice upon such association's officers or upon the residents of the
planned residential development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within 30 days of the date of
receipt of the notice of deficiency and shall state the date and place of a
hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing the Township may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which
they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in the original
notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said
30 days or any extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the
taxable values of the properties within the planned residential
development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a
public nuisance, may enter upon said common space and maintain the
same for a period of one year. Said maintenance by the municipality
shall not constitute a taking of said common open space, nor vest in the
public any rights to use the same. Before the expiration of said year, the
Township shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
association's officers or to the residents of the planned residential
development, to be held by the Board of Supervisors at which hearing
such association of the residents of the planned residential
development shall show cause why such maintenance by the Township
shall not, at the option of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Board of Supervisors shall determine that such association is
ready and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease to maintain the common open space
at the end of said year. If the Board of Supervisors shall determine that
such organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open
space in a reasonable condition, the Township may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said common open space during the next
succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in

subject to appeal to court in the same manner and within the same time
limitation as is provided for.
C. The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be assessed ratably
against the properties within the planned residential development that
have a right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become
a lien on said properties. The Township, at the time of entering upon
said common open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a
notice of such lien in the office of the Prothonotary of Beaver County,
upon the properties affected by such lien within the development.
A. The application for tentative approval shall be made by or on behalf of
the landowner and filed with the Township Secretary. A fee for such
review and approval as per the fee resolution adopted by the Board of
Supervisors, shall accompany said application. Such fee shall cover
processing and administrative costs for the review of applications for
tentative approval. In addition, a deposit shall be made with the
Township to cover the costs of related services provided to the
Township by municipal consultants and engineers in connection with
the review of said application, plus 5% for administrative costs.
B. The application for tentative approval shall include documentation

written communication of the Board of Supervisors, notify said Board of
Supervisors of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case,
the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have denied tentative

unless the streets, roads, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streetlights,
water systems, fire hydrants, sewer systems, shade trees, storm
drains and other improvements as may be required by or under this
article have been installed in accordance with these provisions or
the applicable regulations in effect at the time of tentative

improvements not completed, but required, shall be deposited with
the Township. Said bond or other security shall provide for and
secure to the public the completion of all improvements required
within the period fixed as part of the final approval for such
completion. In the case of staged development, it shall be

estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in the commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township of Brighton and the applicant or
developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be
presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the
event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township of Brighton and the
applicant or developer.
B. Release from improvement bond.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of

at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final
approval or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for
final approval shall have already passed at the time when the
landowner was advised that the development plan was not in
substantial compliance. In the event that the landowner shall fail to
take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall be
deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such public
hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after
the request for the hearing is made by the landowner and the
hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this article
for public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within

§ 195-97. Purpose.
The purpose of the C-2 Mixed Use District is as follows:
A. Build on the Township's current rural character and bedroom
community development to allow for higher density, mixed-use
development in a well-planned manner.
B. Encourage development that will present the Township in a welcoming
and attractive manner at the community's primary entrance point.
C. Create an integrated and connected (physically by streets and in
character by design) mixed-use development within the district with a
land use pattern generally reflective of the proposed land use plan for
the district.
D. Encourage residential and nonresidential development and
redevelopment that takes advantage of a mixed-use form of
development so that demand for a variety of uses can be realized in a
cohesive neighborhood form that encourages:
(1) Connectivity between parcels and uses such that the development
patterns have a cohesiveness and relationship to one another, while
encouraging unique innovation in individual development design
and character;
(2) Accessibility throughout the district to allow for the ease of
movement of goods and people between and among the individual
parcels within the district, such that multimodal transportation is a
priority; and
(3) Uniformity in character and overall layout such that the collection
of uses developed within the district create a sense of place that is
unique and welcoming, while allowing for flexibility and innovation
in design.
E. Create opportunities for a mix of housing choices and easy access to
goods, services, and employment opportunities for current and future
residents of Brighton Township.

developed simultaneously. Therefore, excepting those units in a mixeduse
building, the percentage of approved residential units, as
determined by building permits issued, shall not exceed the percentage
of approved nonresidential square footage, as determined by building
permits issued, within a mixed-use development in any calendar year.

sited on municipal land owned by Brighton Township. The Board of
Supervisors may deny an application to construct a new towerbased
WCF if the WCF applicant has not made a good-faith effort to
mount its antenna(s) on an existing structure. The WCF applicant
shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures,
buildings, and towers within a one-fourth-mile radius of the site
proposed, sought permission to install an antenna on those
structures, buildings, and towers, and was denied for one of the
following reasons:
(a) The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or
tower and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for
that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.
§ 195-135 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-135
1:673
(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.

changes the height of such WCF shall first obtain a building permit
from the Township. Nonroutine modifications shall be prohibited
without a permit.
(8) Gap in coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity
exists and that the type of WCF being proposed is the leastintrusive
means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. Such
gap in coverage must be evidenced by actual customer complaints
and other empirical data, in accordance with federal case law. The
existence or nonexistence of a gap in wireless coverage shall be a
factor in the Township's decision on an application for approval of a
tower-based WCF.
(9) Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all tower-based
WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide the Township with a written
commitment that it will allow other service providers to co-locate
antennas on tower-based WCFs where technically and
economically feasible. To the extent permissible under state and
federal law, the owner of a tower-based WCF shall not install any
additional antennas without obtaining the prior written approval of
the Township.
(10) Timing of approval. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an
application for a tower-based WCF is filed with the Township, the
Township shall notify the WCF applicant, in writing, of any
information that may be required to complete such application. All
applications for tower-based WCFs shall be acted upon within 150
days of the receipt of a fully completed application for the approval
of such tower-based WCF, and the Township shall advise the WCF
applicant, in writing, of its decision. If additional information was
requested by the Township to complete an application, the time
required by the WCF applicant to provide the information shall not
be counted toward the one-hundred-fifty-day review period.
(11) Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days following written
notice from the Township, or such longer period as the Township
determines is reasonably necessary or such shorter period in the
case of a communications emergency, an owner of a tower-based
WCF in the ROW shall, at his/her/its own expense, temporarily or
permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
WCF when the Township, consistent with its police powers and
applicable Public Utility Commission regulations, shall determine
that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary under the following circumstances:
§ 195-135 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-135
1:674
(a) The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
Township or other public improvement in the right-of-way;

Township may assess appropriate and reasonable permit fees as set
forth in a Township Fee Resolution that are directly related to the
Township's actual costs in reviewing and processing the application
for approval of a tower-based WCF, as well as related inspection,
monitoring and related costs. In addition to permit fees as
described in this section, every tower-based WCF in the ROW is
subject to the Township's right to fix annually a fair and reasonable
compensation to be paid for use and occupancy of the ROW. Such
compensation for ROW use shall be directly related to the
Township's actual ROW management costs, including, but not
limited to, the costs of the administration and performance of all
reviewing, inspecting, permitting, supervising and other ROW
management activities by the Township. The owner of each towerbased
WCF shall pay an annual fee to the Township to compensate
the Township for the Township's costs incurred in connection with
the activities described above. The annual ROW management fee
for tower-based WCFs shall be determined by the Township and
authorized by resolution of the Township Board and shall be based
on the Township's actual ROW management costs as applied to
such tower-based WCF.
(13) Time, place and manner. The Township shall determine the time,
place and manner of construction, maintenance, repair and/or
removal of all tower-based WCFs in the ROW based on public
safety, traffic management, physical burden on the ROW, and
related considerations. For public utilities, the time, place and
manner requirements shall be consistent with the police powers of
the Township and the requirements of the Public Utility Code.

1:675
(2) Conditional use authorization required. Tower-based WCFs are
permitted in certain zoning districts by conditional use and at a
height necessary to satisfy their function in the WCF applicant's
wireless communications system. No WCF applicant shall have the
right under these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum
height specified in this section unless it proves the necessity for
such height. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower/pole for the tower-based WCF is the minimum
height necessary for the service area.
(a) The WCF applicant shall prove to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Board that the WCF applicant cannot adequately extend or
infill its communications system by the use of equipment such
as redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other similar equipment
installed on existing structures, such as utility poles or their
appurtenances, and other available tall structures. The WCF
applicant shall further demonstrate that the proposed towerbased
WCF must be located where it is proposed in order to
serve the WCF applicant's service area and that no other viable
alternative location exists.
(b) The application shall be accompanied by a propagation study
evidencing the need for the proposed tower or other
communications facilities and equipment, a description of the
type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio
equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to

which all utilities are underground, except as permitted by this
section. Tower-based WCFs shall not be located within 75 feet
of an area in which all utilities are underground.
(b) Sole use/combined use on a lot. A tower-based WCF may be
permitted as a sole use on a lot, provided that the lot meets the
minimum lots requirements in the underlying zoning district. A
tower-based WCF may be permitted on a property with an
existing use, or on a vacant parcel in combination with another
§ 195-135 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-135
1:676
use. The existing use of the lot may be any permitted use in the
applicable district.
(c) Lot area and setbacks.
[1] Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area shall comply with
the requirements for the applicable district and shall be
the area needed to accommodate the tower-based WCF
and guy wires, the equipment building, security fence, and
buffer planting if the proposed WCF is greater than 40 feet
in height.
[2] Minimum setbacks. The minimum distance between the
base of a tower-based WCF and any adjoining property line
and street right-of-way line shall be equal to 110% of the
total height of the tower-based WCF or the minimum
setback of the underlying zoning district, whichever is
greater. Where the site on which a tower-based WCF is
proposed to be located is contiguous to an educational use,
child day-care facility, or agriculture or residential use, the
minimum distance between the base of a tower-based
WCF and any such adjoining uses shall equal 250 feet,
regardless of the height of the tower-based WCF. Minimum
setbacks are required unless it is demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that in the event of
failure, the WCF is designed to collapse upon itself within
a setback area less than the required minimum setback
without endangering such adjoining uses and their
occupants.
(4) Design regulations. The following design regulations shall apply to
tower-based WCFs outside the ROW:
(a) Engineer signature. All plans and drawings for a tower-based

features instead of landscaping if, in the discretion of the
Board, they achieve the same degree of screening. Existing
vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
(c) An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The
screen can either be a hedge (planted three feet from center
maximum) or a row of evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on
center maximum). The evergreen screen shall be a minimum
height of six feet at planting and shall be grown to a minimum
of 15 feet at maturity.
(7) Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based WCFs
shall employ stealth technology, which may include the tower
portion being painted silver or another color approved by the Board
of Supervisors, or shall have a galvanized finish. All tower-based
WCFs and related equipment shall be aesthetically and
§ 195-135 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-135
1:678
architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment and
shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing
surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent
possible. The Board of Supervisors shall consider whether its
decision upon the subject application will promote the harmonious
and orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development existing
in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a
negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community;
preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest
possible extent; and encourage sound engineering and land
development design and construction principles, practices and

WCF if the WCF applicant has not made a good-faith effort to
mount its antennas on an existing structure. The WCF applicant
shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures,
buildings, and towers within a two-mile radius of the site proposed,
sought permission to install an antenna on those structures,
buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following
reasons:
(a) The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or
tower and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for
that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.
(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.
(13) Noise. Tower-based WCFs shall be operated and maintained so as
not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under

provisions of this chapter have neither the purposes nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it
the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
B. Classification. Sexually oriented businesses are classified as follows:
(1) Adult arcades.
(2) Adult bookstores or adult video stores.
(3) Adult cabarets.
(4) Adult motels.
(5) Adult motion-picture theaters.
(6) Adult theater.
(7) Escort agencies.

individual, he must sign the application for a permit as applicant. If
a person who wishes to operate a sexually oriented business is
other than an individual, each individual who has 10% or greater
interest in the business must sign the application for a permit as
applicant. If a corporation is listed as owner of a sexually oriented
business or as the entity which wishes to operate such a business,
each individual having a direct or indirect interest of 10% or
greater in the corporation must sign the application for a permit as
applicant.
(5) The fact that a person possesses other types of Township permits
does not exempt the person from the requirement of obtaining a
sexually oriented business permit.
D. Issuance of permit. [Amended 9-13-2010 by Ord. No. 169]
(1) Conditional use approval shall be obtained prior to the issuance of
any permit.
(2) Once conditional use approval is obtained, the Township Zoning

(1) Where required, buffer yards shall conform to the following
standards. New developments in Brighton Township shall provide
one of the following buffer yards, as specified in this section:
(a) Buffer yard A (minor): minimum buffer yard width 10 feet.
(b) Buffer yard B (moderate): minimum buffer yard width 15 feet.
(c) Buffer yard C (major): minimum buffer yard width 25 feet.
(2) All areas of a buffer yard not planted with trees or shrubs shall be
seeded with grass unless a ground cover of mulch, bark or stone is
established and maintained.
(3) Evergreen (conifer) plant material shall be used in clusters, rather
than singly. [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 156]
B. Buffer yard design and landscaping standards.
(1) Buffer yard A (minor): required plant units per 100 feet (at the
minimum width of 10 feet): [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No.
156]
§ 195-137 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-137.1
1:694
(2) Buffer yard B (moderate): required plant units per 100 feet (at
minimum width of 15 feet): [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No.
156]
(3) Buffer yard C (major): required plant units per 100 feet (at the
minimum width of 25 feet): [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No.
156]
§ 195-137.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-137.1
1:695
C. Applicability.
(1) In order to provide a level of flexibility, a developer/property owner
may choose from several widths and planting options within each
class of buffer yard as provided in this section.
(2) Buffer yard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the
buffer yard and the number of plant units required per 100 linear
feet of buffer yard. Recommended plant types are divided into four
categories: canopy trees, understory trees, evergreens, and shrubs.
Recommended plant species for each of these categories are found
at the end of this section. The requirements of a buffer yard may be
satisfied by any of the options illustrated, or, in the alternative, an
equivalent buffer yard may be provided.
(3) Each illustration depicts the total buffer yard required to be
erected by the higher intensity use when it is being located next to
the same or lower intensity use, except any residential use that is
proposed to be developed adjacent to a higher intensity use
existing as of the effective date of this section shall be required to
plant a minimum Level A buffer yard.
(4) Whenever a wall, fence, or berm is required within a buffer yard,
these are shown as "structure required" in the following
illustrations. Whenever a wall is required in addition to a berm, the
wall shall be located between the berm and the higher intensity
use, in order to provide maximum sound absorption.
(5) Buffer yard type. The type and extent of buffer yard plantings or
screening shall be a function of the degree of potential
incompatibility of the adjacent land uses as set forth in this section.
Except as otherwise specified, all new nonresidential developments
§ 195-137.1 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-137.1
1:696
shall provide a level B moderate buffer yard, along non-right-ofway
boundary lines of parcels located on the perimeter of a zoning
district.
(a) Buffer yard A (minor): minimum buffer yard width 10 feet.
(b) Buffer yard B (moderate): minimum buffer yard width 15 feet.
(c) Buffer yard C (major): minimum buffer yard width 25 feet.
(6) Buffer yard width:
(a) Each buffer yard, A through C, has four width options. As width
increases, the number of plantings per one-hundred-foot
length decreases by a given factor referred to as the "plant unit
multiplier." A plant unit multiplier of one is used for the
minimum width of each buffer yard. The minimum width can be
reduced, in certain instances, by using berms or berm walls
within the buffer yard as illustrated in this section.
(b) Roadside setbacks and rights-of-way. When a parcel abuts a
road or street right-of-way, and where a minimum setback from
the road or street is specified in another section of this chapter,
that minimum setback must be followed and the required
buffer yard shall be planted along the property line adjacent to
the road right-of-way. Where no buffer yard standard is
specified, a buffer yard A (minor) is required.
(7) Minimum planting. All areas of a buffer yard not planted with trees
or shrubs shall be seeded with grass unless ground cover is to be
established and maintained. Evergreen (conifer) plant material
shall be used in clusters, rather than singly, in order to maximize
their chance of survival.
D. Buffer yard fences, berms and berm walls.
(1) Buffer yard B and C shall include the use of fences, berms or berm
walls as part of the buffer yard requirements. The specifications for
the permitted fences, berms and berm walls are as follows:
[Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 156]
§ 195-137.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-137.1
1:697
(2) If a fence or wall has a decorative side, that side shall face the
public right-of-way, or in the case of a fence or wall separating
residential from business premises, the decorative side shall face
the residential property. It shall be the responsibility of the person
or corporation erecting the wall or fence and their successors and
assigns to maintain both sides of it in good repair for as long as it is
in place. All parts of a fence or wall including foundations shall be
entirely within the property on which it is located.
E. Buffer yard maintenance. Buffer yards shall be maintained by the owner
of the property on which they are located. Loss of 15% of the plant
material regardless of cause shall require the replacement of such
plantings by the owner.
§ 195-137.1 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-137.1
1:698
F. Buffer yard use. A buffer yard may be used for passive recreation and
may contain pedestrian or bike trails, provided that:
(1) No plant material is eliminated or, if eliminated, is replaced in close
proximity elsewhere in the buffer yard;
(2) The total width of the buffer yard is maintained; and
(3) All other standards of this section are met.
G. Township landscaping standards. In addition to the buffer yard
landscaping requirements set forth herein, the following general
landscaping requirements shall apply as indicated:
(1) Residential landscaping requirements. Residential landscaping is
an important element in the Township's efforts to maintain and
enhance its rural and residential character. All residential lots shall
adhere to the following landscaping standards:
(a) All residential lots shall be planted with a minimum of three
shade trees with a minimum caliper of 2 1/2 inches DBH. Any
single-family detached lot shall have at least two of the
required shade trees located in the front yard, or, in the case of
a corner lot, in the front yard or the side yard facing the street.
Existing trees, of equal or larger DBH size, if properly
preserved, will satisfy this requirement. This standards shall
be met within 12 months of issuance of the building permit to
construct the dwelling.
(b) For any residential development containing attached dwellings
(townhouses) and/or multi-family dwelling buildings, one
shade tree with a minimum caliper of 2 1/2 inches diameter
breast high (DBH) shall be planted for each dwelling unit, one
on each individual townhouse lot if such lots are included in the
development, or within the open space area(s). Existing trees
of at least 2 1/2 inches caliper DBH and of a variety on the
canopy tree list, if in good health, will satisfy this requirement.
(2) Business and agricultural fencing requirements.
(a) For purposes of security, a business owner may surround that
portion of his/her property that requires protection with a
chain-link fence not more than 10 feet high, except that along
property boundaries abutting rights-of-way, ornamental
fencing shall be utilized. The base of the fence facing a public
road or residential property shall be planted on the outer side
with shrubs not more than three feet on center and not less
than 2 1/2 feet high when planted, maintained thereafter in
good health by the property owner.

(3) Open space landscaping requirements. Developments that include
required open space areas shall submit a landscaping plan as part
of an application for plan approval. This plan shall provide for
landscaping in the open space that defines space and circulation,
provides shade, provides natural wooded areas for passive
recreation and environmental needs, and provides screening for
active recreation areas, parking lots, and other incompatible uses
from residences. The quantity of trees allocated to common open
space shall not have the effect of eliminating the landscaping
devoted to individual lots. Open space areas within any
development model shall adhere to the following minimum
landscaping standards:
(a) Planting requirements: two shade trees with a minimum
caliper of 2 1/2 inches diameter breast high, or three
ornamental trees or evergreen trees selected from the list in
Subsection J below, shall be planted for each dwelling unit in
the development, within the open space area. Existing trees of
equal or greater caliper will, if in good health, satisfy this
requirement.
(b) Areas with no trees shall be seeded with grass or maintained
with ground cover, nonmowed grasses or wild flowers.
[Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 156]
(c) Agricultural use. While the open space is maintained in active
agricultural uses, the planting requirements are waived.
(4) Nonresidential landscaping requirements. In all institutional,
commercial and industrial developments, one shade tree with a
minimum 2 1/2 inches caliper diameter breast high when planted
for every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area, fractions excluded.
Existing trees of equal or greater caliper, if in good health, will
satisfy this requirement. Parking lot planting counts toward plant
list.
(5) Parking lot design/landscaping.

facilitate design review, a conceptual plan of the entire tract under
common ownership with any area planned for cemetery
development shall be submitted at the time of the conditional use
application. Such plan shall establish generalized locations and
their respective limits for proposed development of burial grounds,
including areas where aboveground stones or monuments,
mausoleums and other structures will be permitted, accessways,
parking, visitor facilities, maintenance facilities, and accessory
development, as well as planned future development of such areas
and facilities not part of the application at hand.
(2) All conditional use applications for a cemetery shall be subject to
the applicable sections of the Subdivision and Land Development
Code of the Township of Brighton, §§ 180-1 through 180-140.

case of an active agricultural use, the pumping of water, for the
principal use of the property where the WECS is located and shall
not be for the generation of power for commercial purposes,
although this provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the sale
of excess power generated from time to time from a WECS
designed to meet the energy needs of the principal use.
(4) WECS shall be located within the rear or side yard area.
(5) The maximum height of the WECS shall be 36 feet. The height shall

submit with his/her application ice throw calculations from a
Pennsylvania registered professional engineer that calculates the
maximum distance that ice from the turbine blades could be thrown
with the basis of the calculations and assumptions disclosed.
Should the calculations project the possibility that ice may be
thrown beyond the property lines of the property on which the
WECS is located, or that structures exist within the limits of the
projected possibility, then the WECS must be relocated to a
distance greater than the calculated ice throw. This calculation
shall not be used to reduce the minimum required setback
established in Subsection A(8) herein.
(10) To protect the safety and property of persons, the applicant shall
submit with his/her application blade throw calculations from a
Pennsylvania registered professional engineer that calculates the
maximum distance that pieces of the turbine blades could be

response to individual complaints and requires that undue noise be
addressed, where feasible, without the Township dictating the
particular operational steps that must be taken. The applicant/owner
shall take the following steps to minimize, to the extent practicable, the
noise resulting from the development:
(1) Prior to site development, the applicant/owner shall establish a
continuous seventy-two-hour ambient noise level at the nearest
§ 195-137.12 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-137.13
1:736
protected structure property line or 100 feet from the nearest
protected structure (as measured to the closest exterior point of
the building), whichever is closer to the protected structure, or,
alternatively, and in lieu of establishing the above seventy-two-hour
ambient noise level, the applicant/owner may assume and use, for
the purposes of compliance with this section a default ambient
noise level of 60 dBA. The sound-level meter used in conducting
any evaluation shall meet the American National Standards
Institute's standard for sound meters or an instrument and the
associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide
equivalent data.
(2) The applicant/owner shall provide documentation of any
established seventy-two-hour evaluation, relied upon to establish
an ambient noise level greater than 60 dBA, to the Township's
Zoning Officer within three business days of such a request from
the Zoning Officer.
(3) Noise levels.
(a) The noise levels generated during ongoing activities when
measured at the nearest protected structure property line or
100 feet from the nearest protected structure (as measured to
the closest exterior point of the building), whichever is closer
to the protected structure, shall not exceed the ambient noise
level (as determined by the seventy-two-hour evaluation) or
default level, whichever is higher:
[1] During ongoing activities, by more than seven decibels
during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.;
[2] During ongoing activities, by more than five decibels
during the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
(b) The applicant/owner shall inform the Township of which level
(average ambient noise level or default level) is being used.
(4) Adjustments to the foregoing noise limits may be permitted in
accordance with the following:
Permitted Increase
(dBA)
Duration of Increase
(minutes)*
5 15
10 5
15 1
20 1
NOTES:

§ 195-137.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-137.13
1:737
(5) If a complaint is received by the Township from any person using a
protected structure, whether a resident or otherwise, regarding
noise during ongoing activities, the applicant/owner shall, within
24 hours of receipt of the complaint from the Township,
continuously monitor for a forty-eight-hour period at a point which
is the closer of:
(a) The complainant's protected structure property line nearest to
the equipment generating the noise; or
(b) One hundred feet from the protected structure.
(6) Once the monitoring is complete, the applicant/owner will provide
monitoring data to the Township and will meet with Township
representatives and affected property owners to discuss whether
possible noise-abatement measures are warranted, if the potential
levels set forth herein were exceeded. If permitted levels are
exceeded, the applicant/owner shall utilize the services of a person
with expertise in noise measurement and noise remediation to
study, with the involvement and input of the Township Engineer,
any possible remedial measures, including but not limited to
construction of sound walls and placement of acoustic blanketing
for sound insulation. The results of the study shall be provided in a
written report to the Township as to whether any such remedial
measures are effective and feasible based on all the relevant
circumstances, including the noise level, the extent that the
permitted noise level is exceeded, the number of protected
structures adversely affected and their location, the nature and
type of drilling equipment being utilized, and whether the use of
any such remedial measures would create a safety hazard or be
contrary to state or federal regulation.
(a) If the written report concludes that any effective and feasible
remedial measures are available, then such measure or
measures shall be implemented as recommended by the
report, to bring noise within permitted levels.
(7) To reduce noise, any internal combustion engine or compressor for
use on any production equipment shall be equipped with an
exhaust muffler or an exhaust box. The exhaust muffler or exhaust
box shall be constructed of noncombustible materials designed and
installed to suppress noise and disruptive vibrations. Moreover, all
such equipment with an exhaust muffler or exhaust box shall be
maintained in good operating condition according to
manufacturer's specifications.
(8) Where electricity is reasonably available to the site, an electricpowered
pump motor is preferred. Where electricity is not utilized,
petroleum-powered pump motors shall have an adequate muffler
system so that the noise level of the engines during the actual
§ 195-137.13 BRIGHTON CODE § 195-137.13
1:738
drilling does not exceed the noise level of 60 decibels at the
property line.
C. Dust control.
(1) The emission of dust, smoke, refuse matter, odor, gas, fumes or
similar substances or conditions which can endanger the health,
safety or general welfare or which can cause any soiling or staining
of persons or property at any point beyond the property line of the
use creating the emission is prohibited. Dust-control measures
shall be used to stabilize soil from wind erosion and to reduce dust
generated from drilling or site activities, including:
(a) Stabilize exposed soils using vegetation, mulching, spray-on
adhesives, calcium chloride, sprinkling, and stone and gravel
layering.
(b) Stabilize unpaved haul roads, parking and staging areas within
the site.

including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions,
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(6) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code153
and this chapter.
