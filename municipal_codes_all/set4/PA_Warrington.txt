Chapter 126
CABLE TELEVISION
§ 126-1. Purpose.
The Township of Warrington finds that the development of cable television
and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and
impact upon the people of Warrington. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technology associated with cable television, the Township further
finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be
served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the
Township or such persons as the Township shall designate. It is the intent
of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the
means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these
§ 119-5 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-1
1:92
matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed
to include this finding as an integral part thereof. Further, it is recognized
that cable communications systems have the capacity to provide not only
entertainment and information services to the Township's residents, but
can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services
to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve Township
agencies and other public institutions, by providing governmental,
educational or health care communications. For these purposes, the
following goals underlie the regulations contained herein:
§ 126-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Warrington Cable

their derivations shall have the meanings given herein. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, and words in the plural number include the singular number. The
word "shall" is mandatory and "may" is permissive. Words not defined shall
be given their common and ordinary meanings.

§ 126-4. Grant of franchise.
A. Grant.
§ 126-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:97
(1) Grant. In the event that Township shall grant to the grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate and
maintain a cable communications system within the Township, said
franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide
the services of a cable communications system as regulated by the
provisions of this chapter and the franchise. The franchise shall
include by reference those provisions of the grantee's "application
for franchise" that are finally negotiated and accepted by the
Township and grantee.
(2) Event of conflict. The franchise shall be granted under the terms
and conditions contained herein, consistent with applicable
statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms
and conditions of this chapter, the franchise, or the terms and
conditions on which the Township can grant a franchise, the
statutory requirements shall control. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(3) General Township ordinances. Any franchise granted by the
Township is hereby made subject to the general ordinance
provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in
the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the
various codes and ordinances of the Township regarding permits,
fees to be paid or manner of construction.
B. Franchise area. The franchise area shall be the entire Township, or
portions thereof, for which a franchise is granted.
C. Use of public rights-of-way. For the purpose of operating and
maintaining a cable communications system in the Township, the
grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and
retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public streets and
ways within the Township such wires, cables, conductors, ducts,
conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals,
attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary to the
operation of the cable communications systems; provided, however,
that grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise
agreement and other applicable local ordinances.
D. Use of Township facilities. In the event that a grantee chooses to utilize
Township-owned conduit or other facilities for any portion of its cable
communications system, the consideration for the use of Township
conduit or other facilities shall be at charges to be agreed upon
between the parties.
E. Use of grantee facilities. No poles or pedestals shall be erected by the
grantee without prior approval of the Township with regard to location,
height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any
pole of the grantee shall be a vested right and such poles shall be
removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:98
Township determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby. Grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where
possible. The Township shall have the right, during the life of the
franchise, to install and maintain upon the poles owned by the grantee,
any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the
cable system operations of the grantee. The Township shall reimburse
the grantee for any make-ready costs. The use of grantee's poles shall
be at a fair and reasonable rate.
F. Franchise required. No cable communications system shall be allowed
to occupy or use the streets of the Township or be allowed to operate
without a franchise.
G. Term of franchise. The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter shall be stated in the franchise.
H. Franchise nonexclusive. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter
shall be nonexclusive. The Township specifically reserves the right to
(1) grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable
communication system as it deems appropriate, and/or (2) build,
operate, and own such cable communication system or systems as it
deems appropriate. Subject to applicable law and regulation, any
additional cable communications system franchises granted by the
Township shall, to the extent practicable seek to create a level
regulatory playing field and shall contain similar terms and conditions,
including without limitation, provisions of public benefit with similar
cost, taking into account the size and population of the franchised
areas. A grantee is required to indemnify the Township and to hold the
Township harmless from all claims against it by third parties arising out
of its compliance with this provision to the extent that such claims are
not barred by Section 635A of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Limitation of Franchise
Authority Liability), or by any other provision of law.
I. Time is of the essence of this chapter. Whenever the agreement shall
set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of the
grantee or the Township, such time shall be deemed of the essence and
any failure of the grantee or the Township to perform within the time
allotted shall be sufficient grounds for the other party to invoke an
appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the franchise,
subject to force majeure.
J. Law governs. In any controversy or dispute under this chapter, the law
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall apply.
K. Transfer of ownership or control.
(1) Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall not be
sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not
limited to, transfer by force or voluntary sale, merger,
consolidation, receivership or other means, nor shall the control of
the grantee be changed, without the prior consent of the Township.
§ 126-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:99
The Township reserves the right to impose certain conditions on
the transferee as a condition of transfer approval to ensure that the
franchisee is able to meet ordinance and franchise requirements
and existing operating practices.
(2) Transfer threshold. The grantee shall promptly notify the Township
of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by
any other party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as
used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual
working control in whatever manner exercised. A transfer of
ownership requiring approval shall arise upon the disposal by the
grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of 25% or more at one time of
the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or 30%
cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to a
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association,
or person or group of persons acting in concert. Except that no
consent shall be required for any sale, transfer or assignment of
ownership or control to an entity under common control with
grantee; provided, that prior to such transfer, grantee provides to
the Township verifiable information to establish that such
transferee under common control has the financial, legal and
technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the franchise.
(3) Township approval. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control
of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation
unless and until the Township shall have consented thereto, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or
acquisition of control, the Township may inquire into the legal,
financial, character, technical and other public interest
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee
shall provide the Township with all required information relevant to
said inquiry. Failure to provide all information requested by the
Township as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the
proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control.
(4) Assumption of control. The Township agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the Township that it or its
designees satisfactory to the Township will take control and
operate the cable television system. Further, said financial
institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise
obligations during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise
control over the system for a period exceeding 18 months, unless
extended by the Township at its discretion and during said period
of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:100
to another grantee. If the Township finds that such transfer, after
considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other
public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the
Township will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such
franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the Township to
such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) No waiver of Township property rights. The consent or approval of
the Township to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a
waiver or release of the rights of the Township in and to the streets,
and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
(6) Transfer time periods. The Township will not approve any transfer
or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction
of the proposed system unless appropriate guarantees which are
acceptable to the Township are made by the transferee.
(7) Disclosure of purchase price. The Township reserves the right to
require the grantee and transferee to disclose the purchase price of
any transfer or assignment of the cable system.
(8) Signatory requirement. Any approval by the Township of transfer of
ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective
controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise.
(9) Time frame for Township review. The Township shall have 120 days
to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that
contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations and by the Township. If the
Township fails to render a final decision on the request within 120
days, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting
party and the Township agree to an extension of time.
L. Franchise renewal. Upon completion of the term of any franchise
granted under this chapter, the Township may grant or deny renewal of
the franchise of the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the
Cable Act. The grantee shall own the cable communication system, but
shall have no property right in the public rights-of-way upon the
completion of the franchise term, including any renewals and
extensions thereof.
M. Police powers.
(1) Police powers. In accepting the franchise, the grantee
acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police
power of the Township to adopt and enforce general ordinances
necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to
comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by
the Township pursuant to such power.
§ 126-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:101
(2) Conflicts. Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the
franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the
Township's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter,
except that any such exercise that is not of general application in
the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to grantee or cable
communications systems which contains provisions inconsistent
with this chapter or the franchise shall prevail only if, upon such
exercise, the Township finds an emergency exists constituting a
danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such
exercise is mandated by law.
N. Franchise fees.
(1) Because the Township finds that:
(a) The streets of the county, commonwealth and Township to be
used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the
boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the county, commonwealth and
Township at great expense to its taxpayers.
(b) The grant to the grantee to the said streets is a valuable
property right without which the grantee would be required to
invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions.
(c) The administration of this chapter and the franchise imposes
upon the Township additional regulatory responsibility and
expense.
(d) A grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the Township
a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise, but
in no event less than 5% of the gross annual revenues, or the
maximum amount permitted under applicable federal,
commonwealth or local law, if such maximum is greater than
5%. The annual franchise fee payable shall be in addition to
any other fee and shall commence as of the effective date of the
franchise. Annually, the Township shall be furnished a
statement of said payment by a certified public accountant,
reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues, a
breakdown by type of revenue, and the above charges and
computations for the period covered by the payment.
(2) Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. The Township
believes that payment of the franchise fee made by grantee to the
Township shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be
in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be lawfully
required hereafter to be paid by any federal, commonwealth or
local law. This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or
payment owed to the governments or other taxing jurisdiction by
the grantee.
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:102
(3) Acceptance by the Township. No acceptance of any payment by the
Township shall be construed as a release or as an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the Township may have for further or
additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
(4) Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an
interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate
equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the Township
primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid
amount is owed.
(5) Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other
cost or damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable
quarterly to the Township of Warrington. The grantee shall file a
complete and accurate statement verified by a financial officer of
the grantee, of all gross revenues within the franchise area and the
number of subscribers per service during the period for which said
quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the
Township no later than 45 days following the expiration of each
calendar quarter ending March 31, June 30 and September 30, and
no later than the 90 days after the calendar quarter ending
December 31.
(6) The Township's right of inspection. The Township shall have the
right to inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit
and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this
chapter. Audits shall be at the expense of the Township unless the
audit reveals an underpayment of more than 5% in the amount of
the franchise fee due to the Township, in which event the cost of
the audit shall be borne by the grantee. Any additional amount due
the Township as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days
following written notice to the grantee by the Township which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
O. Forfeiture or revocation.
(1) Grounds for revocation. The Township reserves the right to revoke
any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and
privileges associated with the franchise in the following
circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach
under this chapter and the franchise grant:
(a) If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this chapter, the franchise, or under
such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions
entered into by and between the Township and the grantee.
§ 126-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:103
(b) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
affect the liability and indemnification coverage or the
performance bond as required herein.
(c) If the grantee, after all established regulatory and appellate
procedures have been exhausted, shall violate any orders or
rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the
grantee relative to this chapter or the franchise.
(d) If the grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the Township
or cable subscribers.
(e) The grantee's construction schedule is delayed 180 days,
beyond the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any
extended date set by the Township.
(f) The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its
debts or is adjudged bankrupt.
(g) Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service substantially throughout the franchise
area, except when approval of such interruption is obtained
from the Township.
(h) Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal
thereof.
(i) If the grantee ceases to provide a substantial portion of
ongoing cable services for any reason within the control of the
grantee over the cable communications system.
(2) Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under
any provision of this chapter in any case, in which performance of
any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's
control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's
control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in
which the grantee holds a controlling interest whether held directly
or indirectly.
(3) Effect of pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any
regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall
not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations
under this chapter or the franchise. Failure of the grantee to
perform such obligations because of pending litigation or petition
may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the provisions of
this section.
(4) Procedure prior to revocation.
(a) The Township shall make written demand that the grantee
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term condition,
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:104
rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for
revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee
continues for a period of 30 days following such written
demand, the Township shall place its request for termination
of the franchise upon a regular Board of Supervisors meeting
agenda. The Township shall cause to be served upon such
grantee at least seven days prior to the date of such Board of
Supervisors meeting, a written notice of this intent to request
such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice
of which shall be published by the Township Manager or his
designee, at least once, seven days before such meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Township.
(b) The Board of Supervisors shall hear any persons interested
therein, and shall determine in its discretion, whether or not
any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause.
(c) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as reasonably determined by the Township, the Board of
Supervisors shall direct the grantee to comply within such time
and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
(d) If the Board of Supervisors shall determine such failure,
refusal, or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then
the Board of Supervisors shall, by resolution, declare that the
franchise of the grantee shall be terminated unless there is
compliance by the grantee within 90 days.
(5) Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires and is not
renewed or extended, is revoked or otherwise terminated, the
Township may in its sole discretion, do any of the following:
(a) Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in
Subsection T of this section.
(b) Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party.
(c) Order the removal of all or a portion of the system facilities as
required by the Township within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the Township or require the original grantee to
maintain and operate its system for a period of six months or
until such further time as is mutually agreed upon.
(6) Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways
and places in as good a condition or better as that prevailing prior
to the grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances without
affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments.
The Township shall inspect and approve the condition of the public
§ 126-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:105
ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles
after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance
bond as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect
during the period of removal and until full compliance by the
grantee with the terms and conditions of this subsection, this
chapter and the franchise.
(7) Restoration by Township; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by
Subsections C and D and/or O(6) above, or any other work required
by Township law or ordinance within the time as may be
established and to the satisfaction of the Township, the Township
may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse
the Township the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an
itemized list of such costs or the Township may recover such costs
through the performance bond provided by grantee. The Township
shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.
(8) Extended operation. Upon either the expiration and nonrenewal or
revocation of a franchise, the Township may require the grantee to
continue to operate the system for a period of six months from the
date of such expiration or revocation, or until such time as is
mutually agreed upon. The grantee shall continue to operate the
cable communications system under the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular
subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be
provided at the time. The Township shall be permitted to seek legal
and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
P. Receivership and foreclosure.
(1) Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall,
at the option of the Township, cease and terminate 120 days after
the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to
take over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
(a) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after
their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms
and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted
pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said 120
days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise or
have commenced expeditiously and in good faith to do so in the
reasonable opinion of the Board of Supervisors; and
(b) Such receivers, or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute
an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in
the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:106
agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and
limitation of the franchise herein granted.
(2) Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee, or
any part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the
Township may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the
successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all
rights and privileges of the grantee granted hereunder shall cease
and terminate 30 days after service of such notice, unless:
(a) The Township shall have approved the transfer of the
franchise, in the manner this chapter provides; and
(b) Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with
the Township to assume and be bound by all the terms and
conditions of the franchise.
Q. Equal opportunity policy. Equal opportunity employment shall be
afforded by all operators of cable television systems to all qualified
persons, and no person shall be discriminated against in employment
because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, sex or physical
handicap. Grantee shall comply with all equal opportunity provisions
enacted by federal, commonwealth and local authorities, as well as all
such provisions contained in this chapter and the franchise.
R. Notices. All notices from grantee to the Township pursuant to this
chapter and the franchise shall be to the Township Manager or his/her
designee. Grantee shall maintain with the Township throughout the
term of the franchise, an address for service of notices by mail. Grantee
shall also maintain a locally accessible office as specified in this chapter
and the franchise, and telephone number for the conduct of matters
related to the franchise during normal business hours. The grantee
shall be required to advise the Township of such address(es) and
telephone numbers and any changes thereof.
S. Failure of Township to enforce this chapter, no waiver of the terms
thereof. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of
the terms and conditions of this chapter or the franchise by any failure
of the Township upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to
seek compliance with any such terms or conditions.
T. Rights reserved to the grantor.
(1) Right to purchase of the system by the Township upon termination
or expiration of the franchise.
(a) Right to purchase. In the event the grantee (1) forfeits and the
Township terminates the franchise for cause, pursuant to
provisions of this chapter and the franchise, or (2) the
franchise is not renewed at/or following the normal expiration
of the franchise term, the Township shall have the right,
§ 126-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-4
1:107
directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the franchised cable
communications system or effect the ownership of the system
to another person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be
as specified in the Cable Act. The Township shall notify the
grantee in writing within 30 days following nonrenewal or
termination of its intent to acquire the system on its behalf
or effectuate the ownership of the system to another person.
Purchase price shall be based upon the value of the system
determined pursuant to this section.
(b) Arbitration. In the event the Township and grantee are unable
to agree upon the value of the cable communications system,
either party may require by written notice to the other that the
value of cable communications system be submitted to
arbitration in the following manner:
[1] The Township and the grantee shall each within 15 days
after such written notice select an arbitrator who shall be
a disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and
experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. The two
arbitrators thus selected shall immediately thereafter
select a third arbitrator who shall likewise be a
disinterested person having reasonable knowledge and
experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated.
[2] Within 30 days after appointment of all arbitrators and
upon 10 days' written notice to the parties, the panel of
arbitrators shall commence a hearing on the issue of
valuation and shall receive all relevant information from
the parties.

the request of either party. All hearing proceedings,
debate and deliberations shall be open to the public and at
such times and places as contained in the notice or as

agree, debate and deliberations may be held in closed
session.
[4] The value of the system as determined by the arbitration
panel shall be determined pursuant to Subsection T(1)(a)
above.

arbitrators shall prepare findings and decision agreed
upon by a majority of the panel which shall be filed with
the Township and served by mail upon the grantee. The
decision of the panel regarding the value of the system
shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should there
be no majority decision, the proceedings shall become null
and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-4
1:108
extend by mutual agreement the time which the panel of
arbitrators has to make a decision.
[6] Either party may seek judicial relief in the following

the part of one or more of the arbitrators; (8) the
arbitration panel exceeded its authority hereunder; (9)
based upon the record, the panel abused its discretion.
[7] In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that judicial relief is appropriate to the circumstances set
forth above, the court in its discretion may order the
arbitration procedure repeated and issue findings, orders
and directions.
[8] The expenses of the arbitrators and those expenses
incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by
the parties.
(c) Notification. The purchase price shall be the value of the
system as determined by the arbitration panel.
(2) Right of inspection of records. Upon reasonable advance notice, the
Township shall have the right to inspect at any time during normal
business hours, all books, records, reports, maps, plans, financial
statements and other like materials of the grantee relating to the
operation of the cable communications system and the
enforcement of this chapter and the franchise within the Township,

information in such form as may be required by the Township for
said records.

right to inspect all construction or installation work performed

provisions of the law. The grantee shall be afforded the opportunity
to be present at and observe such testing and shall be provided
with the results of any such testing undertaken by the Township.

portions of the cable communications system required by public
necessity from all streets and public ways within the Township
within six months of receipt of a written notice from the Township.

the franchise agreement, the grantee shall pay the Township a sum
of money which will, when added to application fees received,
reimburse all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with
preparation of this chapter, the initial franchise agreements,
including, but not limited to, consultant fees, attorneys' fees,
publication fees, travel expenses and all other direct costs;
provided, however, that the Township shall submit a detailed
schedule of all such costs. Such payment shall be made within 30
days after the Township furnishes the grantee with a written
statement of such initial franchise expenses.
A. Regulatory authority.
(1) On-going regulation. The Township shall exercise appropriate
regulatory authority under the provisions of this chapter and
applicable law. This authority shall be vested in the Township Board
of Supervisors and administered through the Township Manager or

enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any franchise
granted hereunder, and to carry out the Township's responsibilities
with regard to cable communications.
(2) Change in law or regulation. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this chapter to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply
with all laws and regulations of the local, commonwealth and
federal government. In the event that any actions of the
commonwealth or federal government or any agency thereof, or
any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication,
substantially reduce in any way the power or authority of the
Township under this chapter or the franchise, or if in compliance
with any local, commonwealth, or federal law or regulation is in
conflict with the terms of this chapter, the franchise, or any law or
regulation of the Township, then the Township, at its option, may
notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions
which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations
or statutory authority. Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in
good faith with the Township in the development of alternate
provisions which shall fairly restore the Township to the maximum
level of authority and power permitted by law. The Township shall
have the right to modify any of the provisions to such reasonable
§ 126-4 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-5
1:110
extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose
of this chapter and the franchise.
(3) Authority. The Township reserves the right to exercise the
maximum plenary authority, as may at any time be lawfully
permissible, to regulate the cable communications system, the
franchise and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or
regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation not presently
permitted to the Township, the Township may without the approval
of the grantee engage in any such additional regulation as may
then be permissible, whether or not contemplated by this chapter
or the franchise.

with other Township, state or regional telecommunications
networks.

performance evaluations, and any other activities required for
the administration of the franchise.

requirements and line extension policies.

(1) Schedule filings. Grantee shall file with the Township schedules
which shall describe all services offered, all rates and charges of
any kind, and all terms and conditions relating thereto. No rates or
charges shall be effective except as they appear on a schedule so
filed. Grantee shall notify subscribers in writing at least 30 days
prior to the implementation of any change in services offered, rates
charged, or terms and conditions related thereto.
(2) Nondiscriminatory rates. Grantee shall establish rates that are
nondiscriminatory within the same general class of subscribers
which must be applied fairly and uniformly to all subscribers in the
franchise area for all services. Nothing contained herein shall
prohibit the grantee from offering: (1) discounts to commercial and
multiple-family dwelling subscribers billed on a bulk basis; (2)
promotional discounts; or (3) reduced installation rates for
subscribers who have multiple services. Grantee's charges and
rates for all services shall be itemized on subscriber's monthly bills.
(3) Township regulation. To the extent that federal or commonwealth
law or regulation may now, or as the same may hereafter be
amended to, authorize the Township to regulate the rates for any
particular service tiers, service packages, equipment, or any other
services provided by grantee, the Township shall have the right to
exercise rate regulation to the full extent authorized by law, or to
§ 126-5 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-5
1:112
refrain from exercising such regulation for any period of time, at
the sole discretion of the Township.
D. Performance evaluation.
(1) Evaluation sessions. The Township and the grantee may, at the
discretion of the Township, hold scheduled performance evaluation
sessions every three years. All such evaluation sessions may be

time during the term of the franchise at the request of the
Township.

and 9:00 p.m. for five consecutive days preceding each session.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]

this chapter and the franchise, customer service and complaint
response, subscriber privacy, services provided, programming
offered, service rate structures, franchise fees, penalties, free or
discounted services, applications of new technologies, judicial and
FCC filings, and line extensions.
(5) Cooperation by grantee. During the review and evaluation by the
Township, the grantee shall fully cooperate with the Township and
shall provide such information and documents as the Township may
need to reasonably perform its review.
E. Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation or utility which permits the
violation of this chapter shall, upon being found liable in a civil
enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a fine of
$600 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred
by the Township. A separate offense shall arise for each day or portion
thereof in which a violation is found to exist or for each section of this
chapter which is found to have been violated. In addition to civil actions
before a Magisterial District Judge, the Township may enforce this
chapter in an action in equity brought in the Bucks County Court of
Common Pleas. This chapter may be enforced initially by violation

(1) Performance bond. Upon the effective date of the franchise, the
grantee shall obtain and maintain during the entire term of the
franchise and any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and
expense, and file with the Township, a corporate surety bond in an
amount specified in the franchise to guarantee the faithful
performance of the grantee of all its obligations provided under
this chapter and the franchise. Failure to timely obtain, file and
maintain said bond shall constitute a substantial violation within
the meaning of this section.
(2) Conditions. The performance bond shall provide the following
conditions:
(a) There shall be recoverable by the Township jointly and
severally from the principal and surety, any and all fines and
liquidated damages due to the Township and any and all
damages, losses, costs, and expenses suffered or incurred by
the Township resulting from the failure of the grantee to:
faithfully comply with the provisions of this chapter and the
franchise; comply with all orders, permits and directives of any
Township agency or body having jurisdiction over its acts or
defaults; pay fees due to the Township; or pay any claims, liens
or taxes due the Township which arise by reason of the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable
system. Such losses, costs and expenses shall include, but not
be limited to, attorney's fees and other associated expenses.
(3) Reduction of bond. Upon written application by the grantee, the
Township may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond to
be reduced or waive the requirements for a performance bond
subject to the conditions set forth below. Reductions granted or
denied upon application by the grantee shall be without prejudice
to the grantee's subsequent applications or to the Township's right
to require the full bond at any time thereafter. However, no
application shall be made by the grantee within one year of any
prior application.
(4) Construction bond. The grantee shall maintain and by its
acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder agrees that it will
maintain through the rebuild or construction of the cable television
system as required by this chapter or the franchise, a faithful
construction bond in an amount specified in the franchise
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantee in the
construction or rebuild of a cable television system complying with
related provisions of this chapter and the franchise, and upon the
further condition that if the grantee shall fail to comply with any
law, ordinance or regulation governing the construction or rebuild
§ 126-6 WARRINGTON CODE § 126-6
1:114
of the cable television system, there shall be recoverable jointly and
severally from the principal and surety of the bond any damages
or loss suffered by the Township as a result, including the full
amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of repair,
construction, removal or abandonment of any property of the
grantee, plus attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the
bond.
(5) Use of performance bond and construction bond. Prior to drawing
upon the performance bond or the construction bond for the
purposes described in this section, the Township shall give the
grantee written notice of its intent to draw on the bond. Said notice
shall detail the basis for drawing on the bond and, if the grantee
has not already been provided with a written notice of violation and
an opportunity to correct the violation, the notice provided under
this subsection shall provide the grantee with a minimum of 30
days to remedy the matter. If the matter is not remedied within the
cure period specified in the applicable notice, the grantee shall
have 10 days from the receipt of such written notice to make a full
and complete payment. If the grantee does not make the payment
within 10 days, the Township may withdraw the amount thereof,
with interest, from the performance bond. Nothing herein shall
preclude the Township from taking action in emergency situations
without the thirty-day period specified above.
(6) Notification. Within three days of a withdrawal from the
performance bond or construction bond, the Township shall send to
the grantee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written
notification of the amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal.
(7) Replenishment of performance bond and construction bond. No
later than 30 days after mailing to the grantee by certified mail

(8) Nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation of performance bond and
construction bond. The performance bond and construction bond
required herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the Township and
shall require 30 days' written notice of any nonrenewal, alteration
or cancellation to both the Township and the grantee. The grantee
shall, in the event of any such cancellation notice, obtain, pay all
premiums for and file with the Township written evidence of the
issuance of replacement bond or policies within 30 days following
receipt by the Township or the grantee of any notice of
cancellation.
(9) Inflation. To offset the effects of inflation, the amount of the
performance bond provided for herein is subject to reasonable
adjustment as provided in the franchise.
§ 126-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 126-6
1:115
B. Liability and insurance.
(1) Certificate of insurance. Prior to commencement of construction,

franchise and thereafter continuously throughout the duration of
the franchise and any extensions or renewals thereof, the grantee
shall furnish to the Township certificates of insurance, approved by
the Township, for all types of insurance required under this section.
Failure to furnish said certificates of insurance in a timely manner
shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
(2) Filing. Any insurance policy obtained by the grantee in compliance
with this section shall be filed and maintained with the Township
Manager during the term of the franchise, and may be changed
from time to time to reflect changing liability limits and/or to

Grantee shall immediately advise the Township of any litigation
that may develop that would affect this insurance.

damages recovered by the Township hereunder, shall be construed
to or limit the liability of the grantee under any franchise issued
hereunder or for damages.
(4) Endorsement. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this
chapter or the franchise shall contain the following, or a
comparable, endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may
not be canceled by the insurance company nor the intention not
to renew be stated by the insurance company until 30 days after
receipt by the Township Manager, by registered mail, of a written
notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew.
(5) Hold harmless clause. All contractual liability insurance policies
maintained pursuant to this chapter or the franchise shall include
the provision of the following hold harmless clause:
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save harmless and defend the
Township, its officials, agents, servants, and employees, and each

action to be taken within reasonably feasible time limits. If such
action is not taken, or is ineffective, or if within 30 days the grantee
files with the Board of Supervisors a notice of objection to the
order, the Board of Supervisors may conduct a hearing and may, if
the evidence warrants a finding of fault on the part of the grantee,
take appropriate action pursuant to the terms of this chapter.

of the Township or without just cause, the Township may, at its
option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time
as grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the
Township or a permanent operator is selected. If the Township is
required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall
reimburse the Township for all reasonable costs or damages in
excess of revenues from the system received by the Township that
are the result of the grantee's failure to perform.
E. Protection of subscriber privacy.

of the privacy rights of the subscriber and the limitations placed
upon grantee with regard to the collection, retention, inspection
and dissemination of any personally identifiable information.

personally identifiable information regarding that subscriber which

The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,17 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of Warrington Township does
hereby order as follows.

to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development
anywhere within Warrington Township unless a permit has been obtained
from the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 181-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.

imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.

Floodplain Areas
§ 181-16. Identification.
§ 181-17. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Warrington Township classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated March
21, 2017, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
[Amended 1-10-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-O-01]
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Warrington Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 181-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-17
1:183
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined. [Added 1-10-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-O-01]
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted in an
AE Zone without floodway, unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed development together with all other existing and
anticipated development, would not result in an increase in
flood levels within the entire community during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the Township may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Township. In the absence of any of the above data or
documentation, the community may require elevation of the lowest
floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. The AO
and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones AO and
AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject inundation by
one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are
between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall
be established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures
on slopes. [Amended 1-10-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-O-01]
D. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Warrington Township has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas,
§ 181-17 WARRINGTON CODE § 181-17
1:184
§ 181-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 181-21C for situations where
FEMA notification is required.
§ 181-19. Boundary disputes. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator; and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 181-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
as delineated and adopted on a local flood hazard map using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.

§ 257-41. National categorical pretreatment standards.
§ 257-42. Specific pollutant limitations.
A. Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the National
Standard (located in 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471),
if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources
in the subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed
under this article and shall be incorporated herein by reference. The
Authority or Department Manager shall notify all affected users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
B. The Authority or Department may also require, if deemed necessary by
the Authority or Department Manager, that the industrial wastewater
discharged by the industrial user be segregated from sanitary sewage.
This will require the installation of a separate drainage system sewer
line exclusively for industrial wastewaters, and the system shall remain
segregated until passage through a sampling and/or monitoring facility,
at which time it may join the building's sanitary drain for continuation
and connection to the Authority or Department's sewer lateral.
A. The following limits of concentration are given for guidance to all
existing and proposed industrial waste dischargers to the POTW. The
tabulation represents the maximum permissible concentration of each
specific parameter acceptable in an industrial discharge when
averaged over an eight-hour operating period. The acceptable peak
concentration of any substance at any given moment shall not exceed
the concentration limits listed herein. Lower concentrations may be
required of an industrial waste if, in the judgment of the Authority or
Department, it is necessary to do so in order to protect the POTW
processes, its sludge quality, and its effluent quality.
B. The Authority or Department may take, at its sole discretion, materials
that are generally considered compatible with the sewage treatment
plant and its processes; that is, materials that are commonly associated
with domestic wastewater, at concentrations greater than those listed
under the eight-hour limit; however, a surcharge will be applied for the
treatment and/or handling of the unusually strong wastes in accordance
with the formula and rate schedule on file at the administration office of
the Warminster Township Municipal Authority or the Warrington
Township Water and Sewer Department. Wastes having all of its
characteristics at or below the eight-hour limits will not be subject to a
surcharge.
C. Wastewater having any characteristics beyond any limit value, as
shown in the following tables, shall be rejected.
D. Extra strong waste, with surcharge, shall be applicable to BOD, COD,
dissolved solids, suspended solids, phosphates, chlorides, sulfates,
ammonia nitrogen, nitrates nitrogen, organic nitrogen, iron, aluminum,
§ 257-41 WARRINGTON CODE § 257-42
1:270
and oil and grease. Additional and more specific limitations may be
contained within the user's wastewater discharge permit, which shall
be binding control values.
E. The following list is subject to additions and modifications as required
of the Authority or Department by regulatory agencies or as technical
revelations may dictate to the Authority or Department that it is
prudent to revise the values tabulated. As tens of thousands of various
industrial materials exist, the list is not a tabulation of all industrial
substances that are or may be restricted by the Authority or
Department.

E. Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specific time period, not
to exceed five years, or may be written to expire on a specific date. The
user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 90 days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the
permit may be subject to modification by the Authority or Department
during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as
identified in §§ 257-39 through 257-47 are modified or other just cause
exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit
by the Authority Manager or Department Manager and any changes or
new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule
for compliance.
F. Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the
Authority or Department. Any succeeding owner or user shall be
obligated to secure his own permit as prescribed herein.
A. Compliance date report and baseline monitoring report. Within 90 days
following the established date for a baseline monitoring report or for
final compliance with an Authority or Department accepted schedule to
attain compliance with the wastewater control ordinance or applicable
pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, the
user shall submit to the Authority or Department Manager a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by the
ordinance or the user's permit and the average and maximum daily
flow. The report shall state whether applicable pretreatment standards
or ordinance requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if
not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user into compliance with the applicable standards or requirements.
The statement shall be signed and authorized.
B. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) For a user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, the user shall
submit to the Authority or Department Manger during the months
§ 257-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 257-51
1:277
§ 257-52. Monitoring facilities.
of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the Authority or Department, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such pretreatment standard. In addition, this
report shall include a record of the measured or estimated average
daily flow during the reporting period, together with every daily
flow that exceeds the permitted flow and the one-day maximum
daily flow.
(2) Again, for a user subject to a pretreatment standard, the Authority
or Department may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by
Subsection B(1) shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports
shall contain the results of the sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the Authority or
Department Manager, or pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard.
(3) In the case where a user is not subject to a National Pretreatment
Standard, the Authority or Department may require reports as or
similar to those described in Subsections B(1) and (2) above;
however, any such requirements shall be defined in the user's
wastewater discharge permit.
(4) In the event the user fails to provide reports on his discharge as
specified in Subsections B(1), (2) or (3) above, the failure will
constitute a violation of the permit requirements and the Authority
or Department will initiate enforcement proceedings in accordance
with §§ 257-60 through 257-67 and, to protect the POTW, the
Authority or Department may conduct or cause to have conducted
measurements and analyses of the discharge and charge the costs
against the user's account.
A. The Authority or Department shall require to be provided and operated
at the user's own expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal
drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on
the user's premises, but the Authority or Department may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
§ 257-51 WARRINGTON CODE § 257-52
1:278
§ 257-53. Inspection and sampling.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
Authority's or Department's requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be
completed within 90 days following written notification by the Authority
or Department.
A. The Authority or Department shall inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all
requirements are being complied with.
B. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Authority or Department or its
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
or in the performance of any of their duties. The Authority or
Department and the Approval Authority shall have the right to set up on
the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
C. When the sampling, inspection, monitoring, testing, etc., is being
conducted because the Authority or Department has reason to believe
that the industrial user is in noncompliance, the Authority or
Department shall charge its costs to the industrial user. Furthermore,
after notification to the discharger of his noncompliance, the Authority
or Department may resample, retest, reinvestigate and do whatever is
necessary to evaluate each day's discharge, charging all costs to the
industrial user until compliance is obtained.
D. Permanently installed automatic sampling devices shall be required at
user's cost when, in the opinion of the Authority or Department, they
are necessary to assure compliance with this article. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance arrangements with their security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Authority or
Department will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibilities.
E. Industrial users must make the records of monitoring activities and
results available for copying by the Authority or Department.
F. All wastewater sampling and analysis must be conducted using the
methods and procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136.
§ 257-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 257-54

Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with this article and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified in the
permit conditions of the wastewater discharge permit. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Authority
or Department shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Authority or Department before
construction of the facility, in a form and in an orderly sequence as
prescribed by the Authority or Department. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable
to the Authority or Department under the provisions of this article. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or methods of operation
shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Authority or Department prior
to the user's initiation of the changes.
§ 257-55. Confidential information.
§ 257-56. Compliance schedule for installation of technology.
The Authority or Department may require compliance schedules for
installation of technology required to meet a pretreatment schedule from all
users, whether permitted or not.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restrictions unless the user specifically requests and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority or
Department that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user. However, the EPA has immediate and
unlimited access to all information collected by the Authority or
Department as part of its pretreatment program.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public nor anyone within the
Authority or Department organization without the technical need to
know the information. If at some time it is deemed germane that the
regulatory agencies know that such information exists, they may be
advised that it exists but will be referred to the user to secure
information. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.
§ 257-54 WARRINGTON CODE § 257-57
1:280
§ 257-57. Compliance schedule for progress reports.
All compliance schedules must contain milestone dates for implementing
necessary pretreatment required to meet the applicable pretreatment
standards. Within 14 days of a milestone in the compliance schedule and
within 14 days of the final date of compliance, the industrial user must
submit a progress report to the POTW indicating whether or not the
milestone or final compliance date was met and, if not, when compliance
with the increment or progress is expected.
§ 257-58. Notification of hazardous waste discharges.
All industrial users, in writing, must notify the Authority or Department, the
state and the EPA of any discharge which would be considered a hazardous
waste if disposed of in a different manner.
§ 257-59. Test procedures.
All wastewater sampling and analysis for the local pretreatment program
must be conducted using the test procedures and methods provided for in
40 CFR Part 136.
§ 257-60. Enforcement.
§ 257-61. Notification of violation.
If sampling by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Authority
or Department within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user must resample and submit results of this resampling to the Authority
or Department within 30 days. Whenever the user becomes aware that the
A. The Township, The Department and the Authority recognize there are
many industrial users that have many and varied industrial activities on
the sewerage system and that, at times, violations of this article and of
the user's wastewater discharge forms may occur. It is the intention of
the Authority or Department to secure compliance with this article as
expeditiously as reasonably possible and with minimal disruption to the
industrial user's operation. The industrial user should recognize, too,
that the requirements of this article and his permit are important to the
proper operation of the sewerage facilities. The Authority or
Department as an agent of the Township and as a policy shall secure
and assure wastewater discharge compliance through positive
enforcement of this article.
B. The Authority or Department has the power to develop and implement
an enforcement response plan (ERP), indicating how a POTW will
investigate and respond to instances of industrial user noncompliance,
both significant and nonsignificant, as required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5).
Enforcement responses include a variation of the following: notice of
violation, administrative orders, civil litigation, criminal prosecution
and termination of sewer service.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 288-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Neshaminy Creek
Watershed Stormwater Management Ordinance" (a.k.a. "Neshaminy/Little
Neshaminy Stormwater Management Ordinance").
§ 288-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed
increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and
manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare
and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 288-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 288-3

§ 288-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Neshaminy Creek watershed by maintaining the natural
hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in § 288-2 of this chapter, through provisions designed
to:
§ 288-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff, surface water and groundwater quality and quantity by the authority
of:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flows.
C. Minimize impervious surfaces.
D. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
F. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
G. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality, and
to otherwise protect water resources.
H. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
I. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
J. Provide standards to meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements.
K. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Stormwater
Sewer System (MS4) NPDES Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
L. Provide for proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities and best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented in the municipality.

[1] To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site
conditions (predevelopment) and for the proposed
developed site conditions (post-development), it is
recommended to use the Soil Cover Complex Method as
shown below. Table B-3 in Appendix B is available to guide
a qualified professional and/or an applicant to calculate
the stormwater runoff volume.55 The calculated volume
shall be either reused, evapotranspired, or infiltrated
through structural or nonstructural means.
[2] Soil cover complex method:
Step 1: Runoff (inches) = Q = (P - 0.2S)2/(P + 0.8S)
Where:
P = 2-year rainfall (in inches).
S = (1,000/CN)  10, the potential maximum
retention (including initial abstraction, Ia).
Step 2: Runoff Volume (cubic feet) = Q (inches) x Area
(square feet) x (1 foot/12 inches)
Where:
Q = Runoff (in inches).
Area = SWM area (in square feet).
(2) Simplified Method (regulated activities less than or equal to one
acre).
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at
least the first two inches of runoff from all new impervious
surfaces.
Volume (cubic feet) = (2 inches runoff) * (1 foot/12 inches) *
Impervious Surface (square feet)
(b) At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of the
commonwealth. The calculated volume shall be either reused,
evapotranspired or infiltrated through structural or
nonstructural means.
Volume (cubic feet) = (1 inch runoff) * (1 foot/12 inches) *
Impervious Surface (square feet)
(c) Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the
first half-inch of the permanently removed runoff.
55.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Township offices.
§ 288-12 WARRINGTON CODE § 288-12
1:336
(d) No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious
surfaces shall be released from the site. The release time must
be at least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours.
(3) Stormwater control measures. The applicant must demonstrate
how the required volume is controlled through stormwater best
management practices (BMPs), which shall provide the means
necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the
total runoff volume.
(a) If natural resources exist on the site, the applicant who is
required to submit an SWM site plan shall determine the total
acreage of protected area where no disturbance is proposed.
The acreage of the protected area should be subtracted from
the total site area and not included in the stormwater
management site area acreage used in determining the volume
controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area = [Total Site Area (for
both pre- and post-development conditions) - Protected Area]
Natural resource areas shall be calculated using the methods
set forth in § § 370-13 and 370-14 in Chapter 370, Zoning.
For additional reference, see Chapter 5, Section 5.4.1, of the
Pennsylvania BMP Manual.
(b) Calculate the volume controls provided through nonstructural
BMPs. Table B-5 in Appendix B is recommended as guidance.56
(c) Volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs should
be subtracted from the required volume to determine the
necessary structural BMPs.

See the Pennsylvania BMP Manual, Chapter 6, for a
description of the BMPs.
(e) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed
areas shall be selected based on the suitability of soils and site
conditions (see Table B-6 in Appendix B58 for a list of
infiltration BMPs). Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on
soils that have the following characteristics:

§ 288-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 288-12
1:337
[1] A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of
the infiltration BMPs and the top of bedrock or seasonally
high water table.
[2] An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater load and dewater completely as determined by
field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inch per hour (in/hr) should
be utilized; and for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50%
should be applied for design purposes (e.g., for soil which
measured 0.4 in/hr, the BMP design should use 0.2 in/hr to
ensure safe infiltration rates after construction).
[3] All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to
completely infiltrate runoff volume within three days (72
hours) from the start of the design storm.
(f) Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. All regulated
activities are required to perform a detailed soils evaluation by
a qualified design professional which, at a minimum, addresses
soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The
general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
[1] Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the site to determine general areas
of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration,
conduct geotechnical investigations of subgrade stability;
infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting these
tests.
[2] Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate
hydraulic conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not
recommended for design purposes.
[3] Design the infiltration structure based on field-determined
capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface
and based on the safety factor of 50%.
[4] If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be
demonstrated to the municipality that the soils are
conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
[5] An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins
where the possibility of groundwater contamination exists.
A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by
the municipality.

§ 288-13. Stormwater peak rate control and management districts.
Peak rate controls for large storms, up to the 100-year event, are essential
in order to protect against immediate downstream erosion and flooding.
The following peak rate controls have been determined through hydrologic
modeling of the Neshaminy Creek watershed.
A. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Neshaminy
Creek watershed for the two-, five-, ten-, fifty-, and 100-year design
storms are shown in Table 124.1. Development sites located in each of
the management districts must control proposed development
conditions' runoff rates to existing conditions' runoff rates for the
design storms in accordance with Table 124.1.

B. General. Proposed conditions' rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the Stormwater
Management District Watershed Map (Appendix D)59 and in this section
of this chapter.
C. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on official maps and are available for inspection at
the municipal office and county planning offices. A copy of the map is
included in Appendix D. The exact location of the stormwater
management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part
of the SWM site plan.
D. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the
management district criteria for the district in which the discharge is
located.
E. Off-site areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates,
developers do not have to account for runoff draining into the subject
development site from an off-site area. On-site drainage facilities shall
be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development
site.

§ 288-14. Calculation methodology.
F. Site areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area
subject to the management district criteria. Nonimpacted areas or
nonregulated activities bypassing the stormwater management
facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
G. Alternate criteria for redevelopment sites. For redevelopment sites, one
of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished,
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions as
determined by Warrington Township:
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Table 124.1 and § 288-13A
through F; or
(2) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to
proposed impervious surface.
A. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used to determine the existing conditions' runoff volume and
flow rate shall be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." A site is classified as wooded if a continuous canopy
of trees exists over 1/4 acre.
(b) All nonforested pervious areas of the site (agriculture, bare
earth, lawn, and fallow ground) shall be considered as
"meadow in good condition," unless the natural ground cover
generates a lower curve number (CN) or rational "c" value (i.e.,
woods) as listed in Table B-4 or B-7 in Appendix B.60
(c) Twenty percent of all existing impervious area shall be
considered "meadow in good condition."
(2) For redevelopment sites, the ground cover used to determine the
existing conditions' runoff volume and flow rate for the developed
portion of the site shall be based upon actual land cover conditions.
If the developed site contains impervious surfaces, 20% of the
impervious surface area shall be considered "meadow in good
condition" in the model for existing conditions.
B. Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a
drainage area equal to or greater than 200 acres shall be calculated
using a generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 125.1 summarizes acceptable
computation methods. The method selected by the design professional
60.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Township offices.
§ 288-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 288-14
1:341
shall be based on the individual limitations and suitability of each
method for a particular site. The municipality, at its sole discretion,
may allow the use of the Rational Method (Q = CIA) to estimate peak
discharges from drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres.
Q = CIA
Where:
Q = Peak flow rate, in cubic feet per second (cfs).
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover.
I = Design rainfall intensity, in inches per hour.
A = Drainage area, in acres.
C. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return-period storms according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 rain data corresponding
to the Doylestown rain gage, seen in Table B-1 in Appendix B.61 The SCS
Type II rainfall curve from NOAA is found on Figure B-1 in Appendix B.
This data may also be directly retrieved from the NOAA Atlas 14
website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/pa_pfds.html. If a hydrologic
computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours.

G. Runoff from proposed sites graded to the subsoil will not have the same
runoff conditions as the site under existing conditions because of soil
compaction, even after topsoiling or seeding. The proposed conditions'
"CN" or "C" shall increase by 5% to better reflect proposed soil
conditions.
H. The Manning Equation is preferred for one-dimensional, graduallyvaried,
open channel flow. In other cases, appropriate, applicable
methods should be applied; however, early coordination with the
municipality is necessary.

design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph. The municipality may approve
the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation
technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the
volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.

(2) Non-PUC-regulated entities. The Township shall make a
determination accepting or denying the renewal application. If the
renewal application is denied, the determination shall include the
reasons for nonrenewal. Determinations to grant or deny a renewal
application shall be made on a nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral basis. The Township shall not unreasonably delay or deny
the issuance of a renewal permit.
H. As-built maps. As the Township controls and maintains the rights-of-way
for the benefit of its citizens, it is the responsibility of the Township to
ensure that such rights-of-way meet the highest possible public safety
standards. As such, the Township needs to be informed regarding the
placement of all facilities within the rights-of-way, including those
positioned aerially and underground. Each person applying for a ROW
use permit shall submit to the Township two paper copies and one
electronic copy of an as-built map or maps and engineering
specifications as set forth in the policies and procedures, depicting and
certifying the location of all its existing facilities within the right-of-way.
Such electronic and paper maps and engineering specifications shall be
submitted in a format and include the information required by the
Township in the policies and procedures and shall be submitted with
the application. If the maps are not provided electronically in the
required format, then the person shall reimburse the Township for the
73.Editor's Note: Exhibit A is on file in the Township offices.

cost of converting paper maps into electronic form or the cost of
converting electronic maps in another format into the required format.
Such maps are exempt from public disclosure under Pennsylvania's
Right to Know Law, 65 P.S. § 67.101 et seq. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
I. Right to inspect.
(1) PUC-regulated utilities. Pursuant to the issuance of a certificate of
public convenience and necessity by the PUC, the Township shall
conduct inspections of all PUC-regulated facilities in order to
ensure that the permittee's facilities conform to the standards set
forth by the Public Utilities Commission. Such inspections shall be
limited to establishing whether facilities meet PUC standards for
construction and maintenance and such Township construction and
design standards as relate to the opening of, construction in, and
closing of Township streets, curbs, and sidewalks, as provided
under 15 Pa.C.S.A. § 1511(e). Upon request of the Township, the
permittee shall furnish a copy of the PUC-approved construction
and maintenance standards that it utilizes in its right-of-way
activities.
(2) Non-PUC-regulated entities. The Township shall have the right to
inspect all of the facilities of the permittee, including aerial
facilities and underground facilities, to ensure health and safety
with respect to such facilities, other facilities, the rights-of-way and
any other public or private property and to determine compliance
with the terms of this article and other applicable laws and
regulations. Permittees are required to cooperate with all such
inspections and to provide information requested by the Township
as part of the inspection.
J. Use authorized. No ROW use permit shall confer any exclusive right or
privilege to occupy or use the right-of-way for any purpose; or explicitly
or impliedly preclude or affect the Township's right to authorize use of
the right-of-way by other persons to own, construct, operate, maintain,
and/or provide the same or different facilities or services, or for any
other purposes as the Township determines appropriate; or affect the
Township's right to construct, operate or maintain any type of facilities
itself or offer any type of services in the right-of-way; or authorize, or
excuse any person from securing such further easements, leases,
permits or other approvals as may be required by applicable law or
regulation to occupy and use the right-of-way; or convey any right, title
or interest in any right-of-way greater or other than an agreement only
to use and occupy the right-of-way for the limited purposes and terms
provided in the ROW use permit and the right-of-way use agreement; or
be construed as any warranty of title.
K. Owner's consent. No ROW use permit expressly or impliedly authorizes
a permittee to provide any services to, or install any facilities on, any
private property without the owner's consent, or to use publicly or
§ 294-30 WARRINGTON CODE § 294-30
1:382
§ 294-31. Transitional provisions.
privately owned poles, ducts or conduits without a separate agreement
with the owners thereof for such use. It is an affirmative violation of this
article to post bills, signs and other advertisements upon utility poles or
private property without the owner's consent.
L. Substantially similar terms. ROW use permits and renewals entered
into after the effective date of this article shall contain substantially
similar terms which, taken as a whole upon consideration of all of its
material terms and upon consideration of the nature of the services to
be authorized and other relevant characteristics of applicants, do not
provide substantially more or less favorable terms and conditions than
those required of other permittees.
A. Persons already authorized to use the right-of-way. Any person holding
a permit or other authorization from the Township to own, construct,
operate, and/or maintain facilities in the right-of-way to provide
services may continue to conduct those activities expressly authorized
until the earlier of the following: (A) the conclusion of the present term
of its existing authorization, or (B) 120 days after the effective date of
this article; provided that, in the case of a cable franchise, such
authorization shall continue until the expiration of the current term of
the cable franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such persons (with
the exception of cable franchisees) shall apply for a superseding ROW
use permit pursuant to this article within 90 days after the effective
date of this article and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
this article.
B. Pending applications. Applications for an authorization to occupy or use
the right-of-way that are pending on the effective date of this article
shall be subject to this article. A person with a pending application shall
submit additional information to comply with the requirements of this
article and applicable regulations of the Township governing
applications within 30 days from the effective date of this article.
C. Persons operating without right-of-way use authorization. Any person
that owns or operates any facilities currently located in the right-of-way,
the construction, operation, or maintenance of which is not currently
authorized, but is required to be authorized under this article, shall
have 90 days from the effective date of this article to file one or more
applications for a ROW use authorization. Any person timely filing such
an application shall not be subject to penalties for failure to hold such a
ROW use authorization, provided said application remains pending.
Nothing herein shall relieve any person of any liability for its failure to
obtain any permit or other authorization required under other
provisions of this article, or Township ordinances or regulations, and
nothing herein shall prevent the Township from requiring removal of
any facilities installed in violation of this article or Township ordinances
or regulations.

this article.
B. Effect of authorization.
(1) A cable franchise shall not confer any authority to provide any form
or type of telecommunications service or information service in
addition to the cable service authorized by the franchise. To the
extent permitted by law, a separate right-of-way use permit
pursuant to this article, in addition to the cable franchise, shall be
required before any franchisee is permitted to use facilities in the
right-of-way to furnish any form or type of telecommunications

(2) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this article and a
cable franchise agreement in effect on the effective date of this
article, the provisions of the cable franchise agreement shall
govern.
A. Alteration or modification of existing facilities. The permittee must
notify the Township upon material alteration or modification of existing
facilities within the rights-of-way. The permittee must additionally

necessary when the proposed street excavation and/or construction
affects Township streets; it shall not apply to any construction or
excavation activities on state roads.
B. Construction standards.
(1) PUC-regulated utilities. Construction standards shall include those

utilities must provide the Township with documentation
evidencing the Public Utility Commission's approval of all proposed
construction plans within the rights-of-way. Upon request of the
Township, the utility must provide the PUC-approved construction
guidelines pursuant to which it operates.
(2) Non-PUC-regulated entities. All construction, installation,
maintenance, and operation of facilities in the ROW shall conform

time amended: the Pennsylvania Township of Transportation
Publication Form 408, the Township of Warrington Streets and
Sidewalk Regulations, the National Electrical Code, and the

Warrington ROW Construction Standards"). In the event of conflict
between the ROW construction standards and this section, this
section shall govern as of the effective date of this article.
C. Security. Each person performing construction in the ROW shall obtain
a performance bond in the amount and as required by the policies and
procedures and regulations of the Township.
D. Right to inspect facilities.
(1) PUC-regulated utilities. The Township may inspect facilities in the
rights-of-way to ensure continuous compliance with the
construction and maintenance regulations of the Public Utilities
Commission, as well as such Township construction and design
standards as relate to the opening of, construction in, and closing
of Township streets, curbs, and sidewalks, as provided under 15
Pa.C.S.A. § 1511(e). Upon request of the Township, the permittee
shall provide the Township with the PUC-approved construction
and maintenance standards pursuant to which it operates in the
rights-of-way.
(2) Non-PUC-regulated entities. The Township may inspect the
construction or installation of any facilities, including both aerial

and determine compliance with the terms of this article and other
§ 294-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 294-34
1:385
applicable laws and regulations. Permittees are required to
cooperate with all such inspections and to provide information
requested by the Township as part of the inspection.
E. Recently constructed streets. No street opening permit shall be issued
to cut any Township street that was constructed, reconstructed or
resurfaced fewer than three years prior to application for a street
opening permit, unless the applicant agrees, in writing, to overlay or
pave the surface of the street, from curb to curb and intersection to
intersection, to the satisfaction of the Township. The Township may
grant an exception to this section in the case of an emergency.
F. Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days following written
notice from the Township, or such longer period as the Township
determines is reasonably necessary or such shorter period in the case
of an emergency, a permittee shall, at its own expense, temporarily or
permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
facilities within the right-of-way, excluding those underground,
whenever the Township, consistent with applicable PUC regulations,
shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration is reasonably necessary under the following circumstances:
the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Township
or other public improvement in the right-of-way; the operations of the
Township or other governmental entity in the right-of-way; vacation of a
street or the release of a utility easement; or an emergency as
determined by the Township.
(1) PUC-regulated utilities. All public utilities must relocate and
remove facilities consistent with the regulations and standards of
the PUC.
(2) Non-PUC-regulated utilities. All entities not regulated by the PUC
must relocate and remove facilities consistent with the applicable
regulations of the Township.
G. Coordination of construction activities. By December 1 of each year,
each right-of-way use permittee shall provide the Township with a
schedule (including plans and projected start and finish dates for each
project) of its planned construction activities for the following year
which may affect the rights-of-way. The schedule shall depict all
construction activities the permittee is committed to perform within the
next year.
H. Abandonment. Except as otherwise provided for under this article, a
person may abandon any facilities or property in the rights-of-way only
after receiving written approval of the Township, following written
notice to the Township of the intent to abandon. If the Township
receives notice of intent to abandon from such a person, or if the
Township determines (after investigation, notice to the owner or other
responsible person, and an opportunity to be heard) that facilities or
property are abandoned, the Township may determine that the safety,
§ 294-34 WARRINGTON CODE § 294-34
1:386
§ 294-35. Management fee.
Annual right-of-way management fee. Each permittee that is not a
franchisee, including Township ROW permittees, shall pay an annual fee
to the Township to compensate the Township for its costs incurred in
connection with reviewing, inspecting and supervising the ongoing use and
occupancy of the right-of-way. The annual right-of-way maintenance fee
shall be determined by the Township and authorized by resolution of the
Township Board of Supervisors and shall be based on the Township's actual
ROW maintenance costs as applied to such permittee. If subject to a cable
functioning or use of the right-of-way and/or other facilities in the rightof-
way will be adversely affected by the abandonment. If the Township
makes this determination, the Township may require the person to
remove the facilities and property by a specified date or the Township
may remove the facilities and property and charge the person for all
costs and expenses associated with such removal.
I. Damage to facilities or property. A permittee, including any contractor
working for a permittee, shall avoid damage to any facilities and/or
public or private property. If any facilities and/or public or private
property are damaged by the permittee, including any contractor
working for the permittee, the permittee shall promptly repair and
restore such property within 10 business days. The permittee shall
utilize the Pennsylvania One Call System prior to any disturbance of the
rights-of-way and shall adhere to all other requirements of the
Pennsylvania Underground Utility Line Protection Act.74

submit to the Township, not later than 30 days after completion of the
permitted construction (or any part thereof, if required by the
Township), two paper copies and one electronic copy of an as-built map
or maps and engineering specifications, as set forth in the policies and
procedures depicting and certifying the location of the facilities
constructed. Such engineering specifications and electronic and paper
maps shall be submitted in a format and include the information
required by the Township in the policies and procedures. If the maps
are not provided electronically in the required format, then the person
shall reimburse the Township for the cost of converting paper maps into
electronic form or the cost of converting electronic maps in another
format into the required format. Such maps are exempt from public
disclosure under Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law, 65 P.S. § 67.101 et
seq. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]
K. Field marking. Each permittee shall field mark the locations of its
underground facilities upon request by other permittees or the
Township, consistent with the requirements of the Pennsylvania One

franchise agreement, the permittee shall not be required to remit both a
cable franchise fee amount and an annual right-of-way maintenance fee to
the Township; such permittee shall pay the higher of the two fees to the
Township.
§ 294-36. Violations and penalties.
§ 294-37. Miscellaneous.
A. Penalties. Any person who violates or permits a violation of this article
shall, upon conviction in a summary proceeding brought before a
Magisterial District Judge under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal
Procedure, be guilty of a summary offense and shall be punishable by a
fine of not more than $1,000, plus costs of prosecution. In default of
payment thereof, the defendant may be sentenced to imprisonment for
a term not exceeding 90 days. Each day or portion thereof that such
violation continues or is permitted to continue shall constitute a
separate offense, and each section of this article that is violated shall
also constitute a separate offense. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
B. Determination of violation. In the event a determination is made that a
person has violated any provision of this article, a right-of-way use
permit or a right-of-way use agreement, such person shall be provided
written notice of the determination and the reasons therefor. Except in
the case of an emergency, the person shall have 30 days to cure the
violation. If the nature of the violation is such that it cannot be fully
cured within such time period, the Township may, in its reasonable
judgment, extend the time period to cure, provided the person has
commenced to cure and is diligently pursuing its efforts to cure. If the
violation has not been cured within the time allowed, the Township may
take any and all actions authorized by this article and/or Pennsylvania
law and regulations.
A. Proprietary information. If a permittee considers information it is
obligated to provide to the Township under this article to be a business
or trade secret or otherwise proprietary or confidential in nature, and
desires to protect the information from disclosure, then the permittee
shall mark such information as proprietary and confidential. Subject to
the requirements of the Right to Know Law of 2008, 65 P.S. § 67.101 et
seq., as amended, and other applicable law, the Township shall exercise
reasonable good faith efforts to protect such proprietary and
confidential information that is so marked from disclosure. The
Township shall provide notice to the permittee in the following
circumstances: (A) if the Township receives a request for disclosure of
such proprietary and confidential information and the Township
Solicitor determines that the information is or may be subject to
disclosure under applicable law; or (B) if the Township Solicitor
determines that the information should be disclosed in relation to its
enforcement of this article or the exercise of its police or regulatory
§ 294-35 WARRINGTON CODE § 294-37
1:388
powers. In the event the permittee does not obtain a protective order
barring disclosure of the information from a court of competent
jurisdiction within 30 days following receipt of the Township's notice,
then the Township may disclose the information without further notice
to the permittee.
B. Leased facilities. Subject to the provisions of this article and with prior
written approval of the Township, a permittee shall have the right to
furnish any facilities for which it has the applicable authorization in the
right-of-way to another person for the latter's use in constructing or
operating its own facilities in the right-of-way, provided that:
(1) The permittee furnishing its facilities to another shall first deliver
to the Township written verification that there is a fully signed and
executed lease, rental agreement, or other agreement with such
other person pursuant to which the facilities are to be furnished.
(2) The person to which the facilities are furnished shall comply with
all of the requirements of this article and other applicable laws and
policies and procedures.
C. Duty to provide information. Within 10 days of a written request from
the Township, each permittee shall furnish the Township with
information sufficient to demonstrate the following: that the permittee
has complied with all requirements of this article; that all fees and taxes
due the Township in connection with the services and facilities provided
by the permittee have been properly paid by the permittee; and any
other information reasonably related to the permittee's obligations
pursuant to this article.
D. Right to inspect records. The Township shall have the right, upon 30
days' written notice and during normal business hours, to inspect all
documents, records, maps and other pertinent information maintained
by the permittee with that relate directly to the terms and conditions of
this article.
E. No substitute for other required permissions. No ROW use
authorization or ROW use permit includes, means, or is in whole or part
a substitute for any other permit or authorization required by the laws
and regulations of the Township for the privilege of transacting and
carrying on a business within the Township or any permit or agreement
for occupying any other property of the Township.
F. No waiver. The failure of the Township to insist on timely performance
or compliance by any permittee holding a right-of-way use authorization
shall not constitute a waiver of the Township's right to later insist on
timely performance or compliance by that permittee or any other
permittee holding such a right-of-way use authorization. The failure of
the Township to enforce any provision of this article on any occasion
shall not operate as a waiver or estoppel of its right to enforce any
provision of this article on any other occasion, nor shall the failure to
enforce any prior ordinance or Township charter provision affecting the
§ 294-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 294-37
1:389
right-of-way, any facilities, or any user or occupant of the right-of-way
act as a waiver or estoppel against enforcement of this article or any
other provision of applicable law.
G. Policies and procedures. The Township is authorized to establish such
written policies and procedures consistent with this article as the
Township deems necessary for the implementation of this article.
H. Police powers. The Township, by granting any permit or taking any
other action pursuant to this article, does not waive, reduce, lessen or
impair the lawful police powers vested in the Township under
applicable federal state and local laws and regulations.
I. Effective date. This article shall become effective on the 30th day
following enactment by the Board of Supervisors.

publicly held thoroughfare within the corporate limits of the Township that
has been designated by law as a public right-of-way.
SIGHT TRIANGLE  A triangular-shaped portion of land established at
street intersections in which nothing is erected, placed, planted, or allowed
to grow in such a manner as to obstruct the sight distance of motorists
entering or leaving an intersection. The extents of sight triangles shall
be determined by using the most stringent requirements contained in the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, Warrington Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, or Warrington Township Zoning Ordinance, as
applicable.
STREET TREE  Any tree, shrub or other woody plant, which is planted in
any right-of-way, or has at least half of trunk, branches or roots extending
into any right-of-way.
§ 294-39. Maintenance.
A. The maintenance, care or removal of any tree, and required compliance
with any provision of this article shall be the responsibility of the
property owner on whose property the tree is located. The Township is
responsible for the maintenance, care or removal of street trees.
B. No person, without first obtaining permission from the Township, shall
plant a street tree within any public right-of-way.
C. All mature street trees shall be kept trimmed to a minimum branching
height of 10 feet where they overhang any public walk or public street.
However the Township may require greater height clearances to
eliminate traffic and other hazards. All trees standing on private
property and having branches projecting over a public walk or street
shall be kept trimmed by the owner of such private property so that the
lowest branches shall have a minimum height of 10 feet where they
overhang any public walk or public street.
D. Whenever, in the opinion of the Director of Code Enforcement, a health
or safety hazard is caused by a tree on private property that overhangs
a public walk or street, the Director of Code Enforcement may issue a
written order to the responsible property owner to take action to
correct the condition within 10 days of the date of the order. If after

§ 294-40. Removal.
written notification, the responsible property owner fails to take
corrective action, the Director of Code Enforcement shall have the
required work accomplished to correct the health and safety condition
and shall bill the responsible property owner. Failure of the responsible
property owner to pay the bill shall result in a lien upon the property
which shall be filed and collected in the same manner as municipal
claims are filed and collected.
E. Whenever, in the opinion of the Director of Code Enforcement, any
vegetation or object located on private property obstructs the sight
distance of motorists in the sight triangle, the Director of Code
Enforcement may issue a written order to the responsible property
owner to take action to correct the condition within 10 days of the date
of the order. If after written notification, the responsible property
owner fails to take corrective action, the Director of Code Enforcement
shall have the required work accomplished to correct the health and
safety condition and shall bill the responsible property owner. Failure of
the responsible property owner to pay the bill shall result in a lien upon
the property which shall be filed and collected in the same manner as
municipal claims are filed and collected.
A. The Director of Code Enforcement may, upon concluding that a tree
located on private property is diseased and dying, or damaged beyond
recovery of health or poses a threat to property or safety, order the
responsible property owner to remove the tree. The responsible
property owner shall have 10 days from the date of the order to take
action. If after written notice, the responsible property owner fails to
take corrective action, the Director of Code Enforcement shall have the
tree removed and shall bill the responsible property owner. Failure of
the responsible property owner to pay the bill shall result in a lien upon
the property which shall be filed and collected in the same manner as
municipal claims are filed and collected.
B. In an emergency where a tree poses an immediate threat to health,
property or safety, the Director of Code Enforcement may order the
immediate removal of a tree. Prior to the removal of the tree, the
Director of Code Enforcement shall document how the tree poses an
immediate threat to health and safety. Prior to removal, the Director of
Code Enforcement shall make a good faith effort to notify the
responsible property owner. After removal, the Director of Code
Enforcement shall bill the responsible property owner for the cost of
removal. Failure of the responsible property owner to pay the bill shall
result in a lien upon the property which shall be filed and collected in
the same manner as municipal claims are filed and collected.

A. Street classifications.
(1) Arterial streets and highways are those which are primarily for
throughways which carry fast-moving and heavy traffic, or may be
considered to handle interstate or transcontinental traffic. Such
streets or highways are generally restricted to limited access, and
for the most part the authority for control of access or construction
within their rights-of-way is vested within the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, Bureau of Public Roads, or the
United States Department of Commerce, or both. Average daily
traffic (ADT) of 3,001 or more.
(2) Collector streets are those which carry traffic from other collector,
primary or secondary streets into the system of arterial or major
highways. ADT of 1,001 to 3,000.
(3) Primary street are those which carry traffic from the secondary
streets to the system of collector streets. ADT of 501 to 1,000.
(4) Secondary street are those which are used primarily for access to
abutting properties and generally serve only internally developed
areas. ADT of 201 to 500.
(5) Residential streets are those service areas of low population
density where abutting properties are of one acre or more in area.
Roads of this class may be considered a part of the master
development plan of the Township, but shall not be included in any
subdivision plan under this classification. ADT of zero to 200.
(6) Cul-de-sac streets are those which are closed at one end, and in
general shall not be more than 500 feet long terminating in a
turnaround with a minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet and an
outer paving radius of 50 feet. The minimum right-of-way width
shall be 50 feet and the minimum cartway width shall be 30 feet.
ADT of zero to 200.
(7) Marginal access streets are minor streets of the secondary class
which are laid out parallel to and adjacent to arterial streets and
highways, and which provide access to abutting properties and
protection from through traffic.

discouraged. In general, the intersection interval of secondary streets
from opposite directions shall be located at not less than 125 feet, from
the center line to center line, of the next nearest intersection point of
the entering street from the opposite side.
D. Streets of the primary or secondary class shall not intersect with
collector streets at intervals of less than 800 feet from the game side of
the collector street.
E. Marginal access streets shall be provided when a development adjoins
a major highway or arterial route. Such streets shall provide immediate
access to all abutting lots, and prevent immediate lot access to major
highways and arterial routes.
F. The center-line profile of streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the
land so as to produce usable lots and streets consistent to reasonable
grade, alignment, drainage, and future municipal sanitary facilities.
G. The rights-of-way shall be graded to their full width as deemed
necessary by the Board of Supervisors to provide suitable finished
grades to the tolerances herein specified. In no case shall the rights-ofway
be less than that specified in § 305-304B, Minimum street
requirements.
H. Provision for additional street width may be required by the Board of
Supervisors in specific cases for:
(1) Public safety and convenience.
(2) Parking in commercial or industrial areas and in areas of highdensity
residential development.
(3) Widening existing streets where the minimum width outlined in
these specifications does not meet with the specific requirements
of the individual street.
A. The minimum radius at the center line for curves on collector streets
shall be 500 feet, for primary streets, 350 feet, and for secondary,
residential and cul-de-sac streets, 150 feet.

arterial streets. All curves shall be superelevated in accordance
with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual,
Part 2, Highway Design, as amended.
(2) On all types of pavement or all subbase construction, curves to be
superelevated shall conform to the requirements set forth in
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual, Part 2,
Highway Design, as amended. The crown will be removed and the
slope will be uniform from the inside to the outside of the
pavement. Full superelevation will be attained at the point of
curvature (PC) and the point of tangency (PT) with runouts as
indicated in the Design Manual. [Amended at time of adoption
of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(3) The normal grade of the inside edge of the pavement or the center
line of the pavement will be held as a baseline from which all
superelevation will be applied. The method to be used shall be as
directed by the Township.
C. Proper sign distances shall be provided for both horizontal and vertical
alignment, measured along the center line. Minimum sight distances
shall be 500 feet for collector streets, 400 feet for primary streets, and
250 feet for secondary streets. Proper sight lines shall be maintained at
all intersections. Measured along the center line, there shall be a clear
sight triangle of 75 feet from the point of intersection for fifty-foot
rights-of-way and 130 feet for sixty-foot rights-of-way. This sight line
shall be indicated on all plans of street alignment. No existing or
proposed structures or planting, the highest point of which is two feet
above road center line, shall be permitted in this area.
D. Intersections shall be approached from all sides by leveling areas. Such
leveling areas shall have a minimum length of 50 feet measured from
the edge of pavement of the transverse street within which no grade
shall exceed 4%.
E. At changes in grade of more than 1%, vertical curves shall be used. The
length of the curve shall be a minimum of 100 feet on collector and
primary streets and a minimum of 50 feet on secondary streets for
every 1% change in grade. Vertical alignment shall conform as much as
practical to the existing contour of ground within the limitations herein
stipulated.
F. In horizontal alignment of streets, a minimum tangent length measured
at the center line of 100 feet shall be provided on collector and primary
streets between the P.T. of the first curve and the P.C. of the second
curve, unless otherwise approved by the Township. In no case shall two
curves in reverse direction be joined together without the minimum
one-hundred-foot tangent length provided for the above two
classifications of streets. Secondary streets shall be excepted from the
§ 305-306 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-306
1:418
above stipulated requirement of minimum tangent lengths between
curves and shall be as required or approved by the Township.
G. A minimum grade of 1% shall be established on all primary or
secondary streets and a minimum grade of 0.5% shall be established for
all collector, residential, and cul-de-sac streets upon prior approval by
the Township.
H. Maximum grades of 5% shall generally apply. In exceptionally hilly
areas, a maximum grade of 6% on collector and primary streets, and
10% on secondary, residential and cul-de-sac streets for a maximum
distance of 1,500 feet will be permitted, subject to approval by the
Township.
I. Maximum grades within 100 feet of the outer perimeter of a turnaround
shall not exceed 4% as measured along the center line of the street.
J. A combination of minimum radius horizontal curves and maximum
grades will not be approved.
K. A normal crown shall be provided on all streets, not superelevated, of 5/
16 inch per foot straight slope extending in cross section from edge of
pavement to center line or from edge of pavement to medial edge,
whichever will apply, symmetrical to the center line.
L. Whenever practicable, right-of-way lines shall intersect at right angles.
When secondary streets intersect primary or collector streets or when
secondary, residential, or cul-de-sac streets intersect with one another,
the angle of intersection of the street center lines shall not be less than
60°.
M. Whenever practicable, right-of-way lines shall intersect at right angles.
When secondary streets intersect primary or collector streets or when
secondary, residential, or cul-de-sac streets intersect with one another,
the angle of intersection of the street center lines shall not be less than
60°.
N. When applicable, street curb intersections shall be rounded by a
tangential arc with a minimum radius of 20 feet for secondary,
residential, or cul-de-sac streets and 30 feet for intersections which
incorporate primary or collector streets.
O. Dedication of half streets at the perimeter of a new subdivision is
prohibited. If circumstances render this impracticable, adequate
provision of the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the
street must be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists a half
street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided
by the proposed development.
P. Reserve strips controlling ingress and egress are prohibited. When the
subdivision adjoins unsubdivided acreage, new streets shall be
provided through to the boundary lines of the development at locations

A. General.
(1) Storm drainage required. A storm sewer system and all
appurtenances shall be required to be constructed by the owner or
subdivider in any area from which the surface or subsurface
drainage could impair public safety or cause physical damage to
adjacent land or public property. The system(s) shall be designed to
collect water at any point where three to five cubic feet per second
is accumulated, at the bottom of all vertical grades, and
immediately upgrade from all street intersections. The system(s)
shall discharge to the nearest practical natural drainage channel or
storm system.
(2) Off-site improvements. Any necessary corrective measures deemed
appropriate by the Board of Supervisors to alleviate any off-street
drainage problem affected by the subdivision or land development
must be undertaken by the developer or subdivider. The costs for
such measures will be borne entirely by the developer or
subdivider.
(3) Total watershed evaluation. The future use of undeveloped areas
upstream as shown on the approved Township Comprehensive Plan
shall be taken into account in the calculation of pipe sizes for storm
sewer system designs. The capacity and maximum anticipated
present flow of the body or system receiving the proposed
system's(s') discharge shall be calculated to verify its capability of
receiving any additional flow caused by the development or
subdivision. The runoff from any proposed development shall be
subject to an evaluation which includes the anticipated runoff from
other existing or proposed developments within the same
watershed. Stormwater management facilities designed to serve
more than one property or development in the same watershed are
encouraged; consultation with the Township is required prior to the
design of such facilities.
(4) Underdrains. All building foundations, grade slabs, and cellar
floors located in soils that have a community seasonal high-water
table within 18 inches of the bottom of the slab or foundation
bottom (as determined by on-site soil exploration) shall be provided
with an underdrain system. This system shall provide for drainage
of the enclosed volume above the slab and relief of subsurface
water to a depth of not less than 18 inches below the slab or
foundation bottom. The system shall consist of a perforated pipe
field of the herringbone or gridiron configuration in coarse gravelfilled
trenches that are in direct contact with the slab or foundation
subbases. The excavation shall provide a minimum of 0.05 foot/foot
slope to the gravel-filled trenches.

1:431
(5) Drainage from nonnatural sources. Water originating from otherthan-
natural sources, such as air-conditioning units, sump pumps,
or other dry-weather flow, shall be discharged into natural
watercourses on the property or connected to the storm drainage
system of the Township as permitted in Chapter 288, Stormwater
Management, of the Warrington Township Code of Ordinances.
Pollutional matter may not be deposited into natural watercourses
or storm drains.
(6) Highway occupancy permit. A highway occupancy permit is
required from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation if
water is to be carried in any way onto the state highway right-ofway
or into the state highway storm drainage system. [See
Appendix D, Exhibit 3.82]
(7) Contribution to comprehensive drainage plan. The developer may
be required to participate in off-site storm drainage improvements

within the ultimate right-of-way of any road maintained by
Warrington Township.
(3) Runoff control measures.
(a) Runoff control. All stormwater runoff shall conform to the
requirements contained in Chapter 288, Stormwater
Management, in regards to the volume of stormwater runoff,
peak rate of discharge of stormwater runoff, and stormwater
runoff quality.
(b) Design of detention basins. All detention basins shall be
designed in accordance with the procedures developed by the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in Technical
Release No. 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or
other methods described in Chapter 288, Stormwater
Management. In addition, detention basis shall be designed to
utilize the natural contours of the land and result in broad,
§ 305-319 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-319
1:434
shallow basins whenever possible. Maximizing a basin's depth
and side slopes, in contrast to the surrounding topography, in
order to obtain additional area for building or lot utilization is
not acceptable.
(c) Basin design criteria. The following design criteria shall be
used in the design of all detention basins in the Township. The
basins shall be designed to detain the quantity of water
resulting from a one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm
under full development conditions released at a maximum
outflow rate as allowed in Chapter 288, Stormwater
Management. All flows in excess of the above-mentioned
standard shall flow over an emergency spillway. Storage
capacity shall be calculated between the elevation of the lowflow
orifice for the basin and the crest of the emergency
spillway. Dead storage below the low-flow orifice shall not be
included. Infiltration shall not be included when calculating
volume requirements.
(d) Underground detention basins shall be designed to detain the
post-development volume of water resulting from a onehundred-
year, twenty-four-hour storm totally within the
storage media while discharging at a maximum outflow rate as
allowed in Chapter 288, Stormwater Management. The top of
underground basins shall be at least six inches below the
bottom of the subbase in paved areas and at least 12 inches
below final grade in unpaved areas.
[1] All underground basins and seepage pits shall be provided
with a means of access for inspection and maintenance in
a manner acceptable to the Township Engineer.
[2] Outlet structures for underground stormwater
management facilities (with the exception of seepage
beds) shall be equipped with weirs to function as
emergency spillways. The minimum capacity of the
emergency spillway shall be such that the emergency
spillway shall discharge the post-development peak flow
entering the basin from the one-hundred-year twenty-fourhour
design storm with a minimum of one foot of
freeboard. The principal spillway shall be assumed to be
completely blocked.
[3] The storage volume for underground basins shall be
calculated between the elevation of the low-flow orifice
and the elevation of the top of the storage media. The
assumed void ratio for coarse aggregate shall be 0.4; void
ratios for manufactured storage media shall be verified by
manufacturers' specifications. Regardless of infiltration,
dead storage below the low-flow orifice shall not be
included in the storage volume.
§ 305-319 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-319
1:435
[4] The storage volume for seepage beds shall be calculated
between the bottom of the bed and the top of the storage
media. The assumed void ratio for coarse aggregate shall
be 0.4; void ratios for manufactured storage media shall be
verified by manufacturers' specifications.
(e) Maximum depth of detention basins. The maximum depth of
water in a detention basin shall be five feet.
(f) Emergency spillway. Whenever possible, the emergency
spillway for detention basins shall be constructed on
undisturbed ground. Emergency spillways shall be constructed
of reinforced concrete, vegetated earth or concrete rubble. All
emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the detention
basin berm is immediately protected against erosion. The
minimum capacity of the emergency spillway shall be such that
the emergency spillway shall discharge the post-development
peak flow entering the basin from the one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour design storm with a minimum of one foot of
freeboard. The principal spillway shall be assumed to be
completely blocked. Linings for emergency spillways shall
extend along the upstream and downstream berm
embankment slopes. The upstream edge of the emergency
spillway lining shall extend to a point at least three feet below
the emergency spillway crest elevation or bottom of the
embankment, whichever is higher. The downstream lining of
the emergency spillway shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe
of the embankment. The emergency spillway shall not
discharge over earthen fill and/or easily erodible material.
(g) Antiseep collars. Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the
detention basin berms. The antiseep collars and their
connections to the pipe barrel shall be watertight. The antiseep
collars shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside
of the principal pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between
collars shall be 14 times the minimum projection of the collar,
measured perpendicular to the pipe.
(h) Freeboard. Freeboard is the difference between the onehundred-
year design flow elevation in the emergency spillway
and the top of the settled detention basin embankment. The
minimum freeboard shall be one foot.
(i) Slope of detention basin embankment. The maximum slope of
detention basin embankments shall be three horizontal to one
vertical (3H:1V).

berms shall be 10 feet. A cutoff trench (keyway) of impervious
material shall be provided under all embankments that require
§ 305-319 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-319
1:436
fill material. The cutoff trench shall be a minimum of eight feet
wide, three feet deep, and have side slopes of one horizontal to
one vertical.
(k) All basin embankments shall be placed in lifts not to exceed
one foot in thickness, and each lift shall be compacted to a
minimum of 95% of the modified proctor density as established
by ASTM D-1557. Prior to proceeding to the next lift, the
compaction shall be checked by a soils engineer employed by
the applicant/developer. Compaction tests shall be run on the
leading and trailing edge of the berm along with the top of the
berm. Verification of required compaction shall be submitted to
the Township Engineer prior to utilization of any basin for
stormwater management.
(l) Slope of basin bottom. In order to ensure proper drainage of
the detention basin, a minimum grade of 1% shall be
maintained for all sheet flow. A minimum grade of 1% shall be
maintained for all channel flow. Basins designed for infiltration
may have flat 0% bottoms.
(m) Energy dissipators. Energy-dissipating devices (riprap, end
sills, etc.) shall be placed at all basin outlets.
(n) Where permanent retention (pond) facilities are proposed,
there shall be a safety ledge, three feet wide, at the maximum
water surface level.
(o) All basin outfall pipes shall be watertight Class III reinforced
concrete pipe having O-ring joints. All joints shall be mortared.
To minimize clogging and to facilitate cleaning, outlet pipes
shall have an internal diameter of at least 18 inches and a
minimum grade of 0.5%.
(p) Landscaping of detention basins. Landscaping and planting in
detention basins shall be provided. It shall be aesthetically
pleasing and compatible with surrounding land uses and
require a minimum of maintenance.
[1] Basin floors. Basin bottoms shall be planted with a growth
of either grasses or a meadow effect of native and
naturalized wildflowers, depending on the desirability of
the basin as a recreation area or as a natural area.
[2] Establishment of grass growth shall include an adjustment
of the soil pH to 6.0-7.0 prior to seeding. In the absence of
a soil test, apply two tons of ground agricultural limestone
per acre (100 pounds per 1,000 square feet). Apply
10-20-20 fertilizer at the time of seeding as needed. In the
absence of a soil test, apply 18 pounds per 1,000 square
feet. NOTE: When hydroseeding, lime and fertilizer may be
included in the mix and need not be applied separately.
§ 305-319 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-319
1:437
[3] The establishment of a meadow effect of wildflowers may
be required by the Board of Supervisors. This shall be
accomplished through hydroseeding which shall contain
seed, water and fertilizer. A mixture of native plants listed
in Appendix B of the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual, as amended from time to
time, shall be used for planting.
[4] Basin berms or perimeter. A plan shall be submitted for
Township review and approval which shows the provisions
for landscaping around the perimeter of the basin. The
plan should include both evergreen material and
deciduous material in the minimum sizes outlined in
§ 305-325F(4).
(q) Facilities designed for infiltration stormwater runoff shall meet
the requirements of Chapter 288, Stormwater Management,
and the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual, latest edition, as amended from time to time.

peak rates of discharge shall be obtained from the
Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14,
Volume 2, Version 3.0, United States Department of
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological
Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA's Atlas
14 can be accessed at http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
(b) Erosion prevention. All drainage channels shall be designed to
prevent the erosion of the bed and bank areas. The flow
velocity in all vegetated drainage channels shall not exceed the
maximum permissible velocity to prevent erosion. Suitable
bank stabilization shall be provided where required to prevent
erosion of the drainage channels. Where storm sewers
discharge into existing drainage channels at an angle greater
than 30° from parallel with the downstream channel flow, the
opposite bank shall be stabilized by the use of riprap or
masonry and/or concrete walls. The stabilization shall be
designed to prevent erosion and frost heave under and behind
the stabilizing media.
(c) Maximum side slope. Any vegetated drainage channel
requiring mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum
grade of three horizontal to one vertical on those areas to be
mowed.

in accordance with the operations and maintenance plan required by
Chapter 288, Stormwater Management.
A. General.
(1) No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, and no
grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil, trees, or
other vegetative cover of the land shall commence until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Township Engineer or there
has been a determination by the Township Engineer that such plan
is not necessary.
(2) All subdivisions or land developments involving the disturbance of
1,000 square feet or more of earth (2,000 square feet or more for
in-ground swimming pool construction) shall submit a plan to the
Bucks County Conservation District for review. No approval may be
given without a letter of adequacy from the Bucks County
Conservation District.

1:439
of an escrow guaranty which will ensure installation and
completion of the required improvements; or,
(b) There has been a determination by the Board of Supervisors
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not
necessary.
(4) Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall
be in compliance with 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102 and meet the
standards and specifications contained in the most-recent version
of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's

Engineer shall ensure compliance with the appropriate
specifications.
B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion.
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control
and drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
(8) Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be mechanically retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of appropriate best management
practices shown on the erosion and sediment control plan or as
required by the Township Engineer or Bucks County Conservation
District.

as amended
A. Intent. The intent of this section is to protect and promote the public
health, safety and general welfare and overall appearance of the
Township by establishing minimum landscape standards and criteria for
all land development. The environmental benefits to proper landscaping
will limit the removal of trees on property within the Township;
establish minimum standards to ensure the replacement of trees
removed from property within the Township; reduce stormwater runoff;
reduce water pollution; reduce effects of wind and air turbulence;
reduce visual pollution; provide for noise abatement; reduce soil
erosion; reduce levels of carbon dioxide and return oxygen to the
atmosphere; increase groundwater supply; provide shade; provide
habitat for wildlife; create a diverse mix of plant species; conserve and
protect property values and otherwise facilitate the creation of a
convenient, attractive and harmonious community; and generally
preserve and safeguard the ecological, economic and aesthetic
environment.
B. Application.
(1) This section shall apply to the following subdivision and land
developments (in accordance with the specific requirements set
forth for each particular district):
(a) Residential subdivision and land developments:
[1] Single-family detached residential dwellings of more than
five units, except that all single-family residential
dwellings shall provide street trees.
[2] Multifamily residential districts.
[3] Mobile home parks.
(b) Nonresidential land developments:
[1] General office, office/nonmanufacturing and business
campus districts.
§ 305-324 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:451
[2] Shopping center, general commercial, highwaycommercial
and limited commercial districts.
[3] Industrial and planned industrial districts.
[4] All other nonresidential uses not listed above.
(2) The provisions of this section are not intended to restrict existing
residential owners from removing trees from their property or to
restrict the clearing of land for agricultural purposes.
C. Landscape plan submission requirements.
(1) Existing landscape features. Included at the time of preliminary
plan submittal on either a separate plan or on the "existing features
plan," the location of existing live trees with a trunk diameter
(DBH) of six inches or more shall be filed with the Township Zoning
Officer at an appropriate and legible scale of not less than one inch
to 50 feet. DBH is the "diameter of a tree at breast height," outside
the bark, measured 4 1/2 feet from the ground surface. This
requirement may be satisfied by the use of annotated aerial
photographs at a scale as listed above, to include sufficient detail to
allow the quantification of trees. This requirement may also be
satisfied by the use of multiple sample areas of no less than 100
feet by 100 feet (10,000 square feet), each to be used to estimate
the total forest/woodland tree count, when, in the opinion of the
Township Zoning Officer or Township Engineer, the makeup of the
forest/woodland is sufficiently consistent to merit the use of such
samples. Information to be provided shall include the following:
(a) Plan scale, North arrow, property lines and location map, with
zoning district designations for the site and adjacent
properties.
(b) Existing contours per submission requirements.
(c) Individual freestanding trees with trunk diameters (DBH) of six
inches or more shall be shown indicating the location and
diameter of each tree.

inches or more indicating the outer canopy or dripline of the
tree grouping as well as the location of individual trees.
(e) Trees in forest/woodlands or groves with trunk diameters
(DBH) of six inches or more indicating the outer canopy or
dripline of the tree grouping.
(f) Within the plan set, existing trees to remain and existing trees
to be removed shall be designated either by indicating
individual trunk diameters with an "X" for removal or by cross
hatching or similar method to indicate woodlands to be
§ 305-325 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-325
1:452
removed. Existing trees that are relocated on site shall be
classified as "existing trees to be relocated."
(g) If more trees are removed than allowable under Chapter 370,
Zoning, they shall be replaced as described in Subsection D(8).
(h) The plan shall contain a schedule listing the total number of
trees (DBH) over six inches in trunk diameter. The schedule
shall also list the maximum number of trees allowed to be
removed under Chapter 370, Zoning, § 370-305, the actual
number of trees proposed for removal, the number of excess
trees being removed, and the number of required replacement
trees.
(2) Preliminary landscape plan. The preliminary landscaping plan shall
be drawn at a scale of not less than one inch to 50 feet and shall
contain the following:

height, spread, caliper, quantity and any special remarks for all
plant material proposed.
(b) If not provided on a separate plan, a list of existing trees to be
removed, existing and proposed water bodies and significant
natural features.
§ 305-325 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:453
(c) Details for the planting and staking of trees, the planting of
shrubs and any other details which depict other related
installation.
(d) Existing and proposed underground and aboveground utilities,
such as site lighting, transformers, hydrants, manholes, valve
boxes, storm, sanitary and water lines, etc.
(e) All existing and proposed contours at two-foot intervals; and in
order to determine the relationship of planting and grading,
areas with slopes in excess of three horizontal to one vertical

(b) The landscape plan shall be signed and sealed by a landscape
architect registered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(c) The landscape plan shall be reviewed by the Township
Engineer.
D. Existing vegetation and natural features.
(1) For the purposes of this section, the term "natural features" shall
mean such vegetation, soils, surface streams and ponds, plantings,
trees, and topography which exist on the site proposed to be
developed prior to any development activity. These requirements
are in addition to § 305-327, Environmental performance
standards.
(2) In cases where existing natural features (to remain) duplicate the
planting requirements of Subsection E, any or all of such
requirements may be waived by the Township Supervisors.
(3) The Township Engineer may require the developer to verify the
presence of existing trees on a site through use of an aerial
photograph taken not more than one year prior to the submission of
§ 305-325 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-325
1:454
the landscape plan or through a field survey as described in
Subsection C(1) above.
(4) During the construction of any site, all trees to be retained within
25 feet of a construction area, including disturbance for roads and
parking, shall be protected by four-foot-high plastic webbed
construction fencing, snow fencing or equivalent staked every 10
feet to ensure that there is no encroachment within the area of the
tree dripline by changing grade, trenching, stockpiling of building
materials or topsoil, or the compaction of the soil and roots by any
motor vehicle. The location of temporary tree protection fencing
shall be indicated on the grading or erosion and sedimentation
control plans for the application, and the installation of fencing
shall be specifically noted in the construction sequence. (Note
Chapter 370, Zoning, § 370-3622.)
(5) Trees that are proposed for removal and are located within 15 feet
of trees to remain shall be cut flush to grade and then ground to a
minimum of 12 inches below grade. Damage to roots of trees to
remain shall be avoided.
(6) Protection of topsoil.
(a) Each lot shall have at least six inches of topsoil cover, after
settlement, over all of the site's exposed earth surfaces. More
than six inches may be required if the Township Engineer
determines that a greater amount is needed for the long-term
viability of certain plantings.
(b) Topsoil moved and stockpiled by grading operations shall be
redistributed and stabilized following the completion of a
project or project phase. All exposed earth surfaces shall be
stabilized within the time frame specified by 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 102, Erosion and Sediment Control.
(c) All disturbed topsoil on site is to be redistributed on site in
areas not covered by impervious surfaces. No removal of
topsoil from a site is allowed unless approved by the
Warrington Township Manager or Zoning Officer.
(7) Credit for preservation of existing trees.
(a) The requirements for trees in the following Subsection E(6)(b)
and (f), Softening buffer and Screen buffer, and Subsection
E(10), Individual lot landscaping requirements, can be met by
preserving existing trees, and, to that end, the number of trees
required in those sections may be reduced by a credit for
approved preserved trees computed as follows:
§ 305-325 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:455
Diameter* of Tree Trunk of
Approved Preserved Trees
(inches)
Number of 3-Inch-Caliper
Tree Credits
36 or greater 6
30 to 35 5
26 to 29 4
20 to 25 3
13 to 19 2
6 to 12 1
NOTE:
* DBH is the "diameter of a tree at breast height," outside
the bark, measured 4 1/2 feet from the ground surface.
(b) A tree shall be deemed to be preserved when the plan provides
for it to be maintained in such manner that 3/4 of the ground
area within the dripline of the tree shall be maintained at the
existing grade level in either vegetative landscape material or
pervious surface cover.
(c) Trees designated for approval as preserved trees shall be
preserved as specified in the Guidelines for Tree Preservation
and Protection by the Association of Consulting Arborists. At
the direction of the Township Engineer, existing trees that have
not been adequately protected during construction or that die
within the guarantee period are to be removed and replaced
using the appropriate quantities for the diameter of the
removed trees as shown in the table above.
(d) Trees to be considered for credit must be located in the
specific area of the required landscape plantings.
(e) In determining trees to be protected, consideration shall be
given to maintaining a clear zone between new buildings and
preserved forest/woodland edges. The following guidelines are
suggested: buildings, 20 to 30 feet; pavement/walks, 10 feet.
(8) Removal and replacement of existing trees.
(a) Any person, organization, association or corporation engaging
in site work such as grading, new construction or other activity
which will result in the destruction of more than the allowable
percentages noted in Chapter 370, Zoning, § 370-305,
Environmental restriction standards, Subsection E, of existing
trees six inches DBH or greater on a lot containing two or more
acres shall prepare a plan in accordance with Subsection C(1)
of this section.
§ 305-325 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-325
1:456
(b) If greater than the allowable percentages noted in Chapter
370, Zoning, § 370-305, Environmental restriction standards,
Subsection E, of existing trees on a site with a trunk diameter
of six inches DBH are removed or destroyed because of street
alignment, building placement, parking area location, grading
or otherwise, then existing trees destroyed shall be replaced in
accordance with the following chart:
Tree Size Removed
(inches)
Number of 3-Inch
Replacements
6 to 12 1
To 18 2
To 24 3
To 30 4
To 36 5
To 42 6
Greater than 42 7
[1] The replacement trees may be selected from the approved
Recommended Plant Material List.85
[2] Such new trees shall be planted in addition to the trees
and/or shrubs required under Subsection E. If there is
insufficient space to plant all of the required trees, the
developer shall plant all remaining trees on lands owned
by the Township as directed by the Township Manager or
his designee. At the sole discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, the Township Manager may accept a fee in
lieu of such plantings. The fee shall be the full cost that
would otherwise be incurred by the developer for the plant
and installation and shall be used for landscaping
Township-owned land as directed by the Board of
Supervisors or the Township Manager.
[3] These replacement trees shall be shown on the landscape
plan with a schedule of trees to be removed and trees to be
used for replacement as defined in Subsection C(1) or on
the landscape plan with a separate plant schedule for
replacement trees or shown as trees to be contributed to
the Township. A maximum of 50% of the required trees
may be replaced as evergreen trees and/or ornamental
trees at a ratio of two evergreen or ornamental trees per
each replacement. A maximum of 20% of the required
trees may be replaced as shrubs at a ratio of 10 shrubs per
85.Editor's Note: Said list is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 305-325 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:457
required tree. Refer to Subsection F for sizes and types of
trees and shrubs recommended.
(c) Prior to removal of existing trees greater than six inches DBH,
the Township Engineer shall walk the site to review the trees to
be removed. Based upon such review, the Township Engineer
shall establish the quantity of trees and value to be contributed
to the escrow account for replacement of trees as provided in
Subsection D(8). If the developer disputes the conclusion of the
Township Engineer, the owner/developer shall notify the
Township Manager, in writing, and shall arrange with the
Township Manager for a joint inspection of the site.
E. Landscape design requirements.
(1) The location, dimensions, and spacing of required plantings should
be adequate for their proper growth and maintenance, taking into
account the sizes of such plantings at maturity and their present
and future environmental requirements, such as wind, soil,
moisture and sunlight.
(2) Planting guidelines.
(a) Plantings shall be selected and located where they will not
contribute to conditions hazardous to the public's health,
safety, and welfare. Such locations include, but shall not be
limited to: public street rights-of-way; underground and
aboveground utilities; and sight triangle areas required for
unobstructed views at street intersections as required per
pertinent sections of this chapter and Chapter 370, Zoning. In
addition, plantings at the ends of parking lot drive aisles must
be designed to stay below two vertical feet to maximize
visibility for motorists and pedestrians and minimize screening
due to high vegetation.
(b) Trees and shrubs shall be located so as not to interfere with the
installation and maintenance of sidewalks and utilities. Trees
shall be planted 15 feet from overhead utilities and six feet
from underground utilities.
(3) All plant materials used shall meet the minimum standards for
health, form, and root condition as outlined in the American
Association of Nurserymen (AAN) Standards and, at the time of
planting, meet minimum size requirements as stated in Subsection
F.
(4) Caliper. For measuring trees for buffering or landscaping purposes,
caliper measurements shall be taken at a point on the trunk six
inches above the natural ground line.
(5) Street trees.
§ 305-325 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-325
1:458
(a) Street trees shall be planted for any subdivision or land
development where suitable street trees do not exist, as part of
the design and construction of:
[1] New streets.
[2] New sidewalks or pedestrian ways.
[3] Existing streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, highways,
bicycle trails or pathways when they abut or lie within the
subdivision or land development.
[4] Access driveways to residential developments having more
than four dwelling units.
[5] Renovations to or widening of existing streets or
sidewalks.
(b) Spacing. Street trees shall be planted no closer than 40 feet on
center nor further than 50 feet on center for each side of the
street, except along major roads where, with the approval of
the Board of Supervisors, they may be up to 100 feet on center;
or an equivalent number may be planted in an informal
arrangement.
(c) Setback. Street trees shall be planted a minimum distance of
two feet outside and parallel to the right-of-way line, unless
otherwise approved by the Township Engineer. Trees located
at intersections shall respect the sight triangle as defined in
this chapter and Chapter 370, Zoning. Adequate separation
from overhead and underground utilities shall be provided.
(d) Existing trees along a street which would be suitable based on
species, condition and form as street trees can be counted
toward the street tree requirement and shall be over four
inches in caliper and be within 20 feet of the curb or road edge.
(e) Street trees shall have a clear trunk from ground level to seven
feet above ground level, with full branching structure. All
hanging branches shall be trimmed to maintain a minimum
height of seven feet above the ground surface at all times.
(6) Buffers and perimeter areas.
(a) Consistent with the intent of this section and § 370-3607,
Screening and buffering and planting strip requirements, of
Chapter 370, Zoning, the entire perimeter of a property being
developed shall have a buffer which includes trees, shrubs, and
other landscape improvements necessary to screen the visual
impact the development will have on the property, on adjoining
properties, and on the Township.
§ 305-325 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:459
(b) Softening buffer. Along the sides and rear of property lines of
all developments where existing vegetation is not sufficient, at
the discretion of the Township Engineer, and a screen buffer is
not required, a permanent softening buffer shall be planted.
The following landscape requirements must be adhered to:
[1] Softening buffer plant materials shall include a
combination of trees and shrubs in free-form arrangement.
As a guideline for the amount of plant materials to use, the
buffer shall consist of a minimum of four shade trees for
each 100 linear feet and eight shrubs for each 100 linear
feet of property line. Informal groupings that reflect the
natural character of the site are encouraged. Up to 50% of
shade trees may be substituted with ornamental or
evergreen trees or shrubs at a rate of two ornamental, two
evergreen trees, or 10 shrubs for every shade tree.
(c) The buffer planting area along the property lines shall be used
for no purpose other than planting of trees, shrubs and lawn,
unless approved by the Zoning Officer or Township Engineer. It
may include a wall or fence. Any wall or fence shall be
compatible and constructed in such a manner that it will not
conflict with the character of the abutting district.
(d) The buffer plantings shall be aligned along the property lines
or right-of-way boundaries but may be sited on any position of
the property if recommended by the Township Planning
Commission and permitted by the Board of Supervisors. An
innovative and free-form arrangement of plant materials is
encouraged. [Amended 2-11-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-O-01]
(e) Within the buffer area, no proposed slopes shall be steeper
than four horizontal to one vertical (25%), unless these areas
previously existed at a steeper slope than 4:1 and no new
grading is proposed within such areas.
(f) Screen buffer. Where under applicable sections of Chapter
370, Zoning, screen buffers are required for the entire length
of all common boundaries abutting noncomplementary
districts, the following landscape requirements shall be
adhered to:
[1] Trees and shrubs used for screening shall be composed of
at least 75% evergreen and shall be arranged to provide an
immediate visual screen of 50%. Evergreen trees shall be
at least eight feet in height at the time of planting. The
balance of the plantings may be deciduous trees and
shrubs.
[2] Walls, ornamental structures, fences and berms or a
combination of these may be used in combination with
§ 305-325 WARRINGTON CODE § 305-325
1:460
appropriate plant material, subject to the specific land use
areas involved and as approved by the Township Board of
Supervisors.
[3] Screening shall consist of evergreen trees in double rows,
staggered 10 feet to 20 feet on center. The spacing will
depend on the type of tree used. Evergreen or deciduous
shrubs shall supplement the evergreen trees at a minimum
rate of 20 per 100 feet.
[4] The planting screen shall be broken only at points of
vehicular or pedestrian access.
(g) The establishment of large monoculture evergreen buffers is
discouraged. Where a buffer planting shall include 40 or more
evergreen trees, no more than 1/3 of these evergreen trees
shall be a single species of tree. The use of Pinus strobus, white
pine, in buffer plantings of less than 40 but more than 15
required evergreens shall be limited to 1/3 Pinus strobus
species. Screen buffers of less than 15 required evergreens
shall be made up of species other than Pinus strobus.
(7) Off-street parking area.
(a) The perimeters of off-street parking lots in all districts shall be
buffered in accordance with the above regulations for
softening buffers. This shall include the introduction of
landscape elements or softscape separation between buildings
and parking as well as between parking areas and public
streets. In addition, any parking closer than 50 feet to a public
street right-of-way or residential district shall have a
continuous row of shrubs, fence, wall, berm or a combination
of these to a minimum height of three feet between the street
or residential district and parking area.
(b) Not more than 15 parking spaces shall be placed in a
continuous row without an intervening planting island of at
least 10 feet in width and the length of the parking stall.
(c) There shall be a minimum of one shade tree per 15 spaces, and
all planting beds within a parking lot shall be surfaced with
lawn, ground cover or low-growing shrubs. Proposed trees,
shrubs and ground cover can be placed around the parking
area perimeter or within interior islands or at locations
acceptable to the Township Manager or his designee.
(d) Planter islands shall be placed at the end of each row of
parking spaces which begins or terminates at an internal
circulation aisle. End islands adjacent to primary traffic
circulation routes shall have only low-growing shrubs, ground
cover or grass so as to not impede adequate sight distance.
§ 305-325 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-325
1:461
(e) For any land use where the total number of parking spaces in
one parking lot exceeds 100 stalls, the parking area shall be
divided by continuous center islands perpendicular to the
spaces every 130 feet, assuming four rows of parking and two
aisles. These divider islands shall be a minimum of 10 feet
wide.
(8) Drainage area and detention/retention basin landscaping.
(a) Whenever a detention or retention basin is provided, such
basin shall conform to the requirements set forth in the
applicable Zoning, Stormwater Management and Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinances and the landscaping
requirements as follows.
(b) The basin shall be so designed that the plantings in and
adjacent to it shall not have a negative effect on the
hydrological function of the basin. Trees shall be kept off of
permanent stormwater control basin berms in accordance with
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
requirements.
(c) All continuously flowing natural watercourses shall be
maintained in their natural state, except that removal of debris
and correction of severe erosion shall be required.
(d) Intermittent streams shall be maintained essentially at their
existing alignments and gradients, except that they may be
improved by minor regrading, unless otherwise restricted by
state, federal or Warrington Township zoning regulations, and
shall either be planted and stabilized in vegetative cover or
provided with erosion control improvements such as river
stone or rip-rap.
(e) Drainageways and detention and retention basins shall be
aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the adjacent land
use. Creative grading and innovative basin forms are
encouraged. The use of best management practices as detailed
in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual 2009, or latest addition, is also encouraged. Where
basins adjoin existing forest/woodlands, it is recommended
that plantings be selected to blend with the natural
surroundings.
(f) Basin floors.
[1] Soil covers other than lawn are encouraged where
appropriate. Where lawn is not specified, plans shall
include a narrative and schedule for short- and long-term
maintenance to include cutting/harvesting, reseeding,
fertilizing, selected weed removal and the party
responsible for maintenance. Trees are encouraged

promote diversity, up to 50% of the shade trees may be
substituted with an option of two flowering trees or
evergreen trees, or 10 shrubs for every shade tree.
[2] This requirement is in addition to required softening
buffers where basins are against property edges.
[3] This requirement may be waived along portions of a basin
where screen buffer is required and where the applicant
can demonstrate that such added buffer will not produce
added screening benefit, provided that the applicant
agrees to provide equivalent plantings at other areas in
the Township as directed by the Board of Supervisors or
the Township Manager.
[4] Sufficient plantable area shall be provided between
stormwater basins and property lines and buildings to
permit the satisfactory spacing and placement of required

costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the
Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither
pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge determining that
there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good-faith basis for the person, partnership, or corporation
violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge, and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.
(2) The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a

issued by the Township for the purpose of authorizing commencement
of construction of those public improvements contemplated by the
improvement plans for which provision has been made by the terms of
the subdivision agreement. Payment to the Township for the building
permit shall accompany the application. If said documents are in proper
form and the security submitted by the subdivider is approved by the
Township, the building permit will then be issued by the Township.

issuance of a construction permit and no improvements have been
constructed, or if the improvements have been commenced and there
has been no construction performed for a period of six months, the
Board shall require that, prior to any further construction, the plan
shall be resubmitted and changes and modifications to the plan may be
required. No building permits will be issued; all work on issued building
permits will be terminated; and no permit will be issued for the
continuation of construction improvements until such changes and
modifications, if necessary, as are ordered by the Board, have been
incorporated in the plan and, when required, additional security has
been posted to guaranty completion of the improvements. An extension
of six months may be granted by the Board upon written request
therefor.

calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of

person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2) below, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
§ 318-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 318-31
1:545
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3) below.
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2) above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2) above, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the
per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of
tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in
that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2) above, it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.

and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Board of Supervisors or the
collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.

A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the

performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,

whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth

length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
§ 318-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 318-32

§ 318-33. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 318-34. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.

determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of
each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 318-35. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession with a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with

this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this
article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.

of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 318-38. Administration.
§ 318-39. Suits for collection.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
C. The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the collector may sue for the

such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

B. Construction.
(1) Casing.
(a) All wells serving as a water supply shall be equipped with a
watertight and durable wrought-iron, steel or other type of
approved casing equivalent to Schedule 40 280 wall thickness.
The section of casing shall be joined together by threaded
§ 353-6 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-6
1:636
couplings or joints, by welding, or by any other watertight
approved joint or coupling. The casing shall be carried to a
minimum depth of 40 feet and (then) extended an additional
five feet into firm bedrock or other impervious strata and
grouted in place. Well casing material other than wrought iron
or steel must be resistant to the corrosiveness of the water and
to the stresses to which it will be subjected during installation
and the grouting operation. Casing and grouting material must
be compatible. The criteria established in AWWA Standard
A100-15 must be followed. Casings shall terminate a minimum
of 18 inches above the surrounding, finished ground surface
grade. All casings for water supply or geothermal return wells
shall be fitted with an insect-resistant well cap. [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions,
Art. I)]
(b) Ferrous casings shall be new pipe meeting ASTM or API
specifications for water well construction, have additional
thickness and weight if minimum thickness is not considered
sufficient to assure reasonable life expectancy of the well, be
capable of withstanding forces to which it is subjected and
have full-circumference welds or threaded pipe joints.
(c) Watertight well casing must be placed at a sufficient depth to
prevent the entrance of pollution from surface runoff and
polluted aquifers.
(2) Grout materials and placement.
(a) All grout information (type of cement or bentonite and number
of bags of cement or bentonite used for grouting) must be
submitted in writing on Form WTWSD-01 to the Department by
the well driller within 30 days of completion of the well drilling
process.
(b) In all well installations, an annular space shall be provided
between the well casing and the earth formation. The annular
space shall be completely filled with approved grout materials,
in one continuous operation, under pressure from the bottom
to the natural land surface, within 24 hours after completion of
the drilling. In the event that grouting is done following the
completion of all drilling operations, care must be taken to
prevent the entrance of drillers mud into the annulus during
the completion of the bore hole by the use of a rubber packer
or other acceptable method. The annular space shall be
completely cleared of all obstructions prior to the placement of
the grout material. Exterior grouting methods must be used in
this instance. The casing shall be sealed effectively against
entrance of water from water bearing zones which are subject
to pollution, through which the casing may pass, by grouting a
minimum of 10 feet above and 10 feet below the polluted or
§ 353-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-6
1:637
undesirable water-bearing zone. During the installation of the
pitless adapter, grout material may be removed from the
exterior of the casing in order to provide a watertight seal
between the casing and the pitless adapter.
(c) After the grout has been placed in the annular space, drilling of
the bore hole may proceed for a maximum of four hours; and if
not completed within that time period, a curing time of 36
hours must be provided before drilling may resume. A curing
time of 12 hours for Type III portland cement must be provided
immediately following the placement of the grout. Drilling is
not permitted during the curing period. If casings of smaller
diameter are used in the lower portions of the well, effective
watertight seals shall be provided between the casings where
they telescope for a minimum distance of four feet.
(d) The annular space of all well installations must be filled with
one of the following listed grout materials:
[1] Neat cement grout shall consist of a mixture of API Class G
(or Class B similar to ASTM C150 Type II) and water in the
ratio of 0.67 cubic foot (0.019 m3) of water per ninety-fourpound
(42.7 kilograms) sack weighing approximately 228
pounds per cubic foot. A maximum of 6% by weight of
bentonite and 2% by weight of calcium chloride may be
added.
[2] Pozmix-cement grout shall consist of a mixture of 50% by
volume of Pozzolan A (74 lbs./cu. ft.3) (1185 kg/m3) and
50% by volume of API Spec. 10, Class G cement with 0.77
cubic feet (0.02 m3) of water per 84 pounds (38.2
kilograms) of mixture. To this mixture of 2% by weight of
calcium chloride, at the discretion of the contractor.
[3] Concrete grout shall contain 5.3 sacks of Portland cement
(ASTM C150 Type II) per cubic yard of concrete and a
maximum of seven gallons (0.026 m3) of water per ninetyfour-
pound (42.7 kilograms) sack of cement. The maximum
slump shall be four inches. The aggregate shall consist of
47% sand and 53% coarse aggregate, conforming to ASTM
Designation c-33. The maximum size aggregate should be
0.75 inches. Concrete grout shall not be placed in an
annulus of less than three inches.
[4] Sand cement grout shall consist of a mixture of Portland
cement (ASTM C150 Type II), sand and water in the
proportion of not more than two parts by weight of sand to
one part of cement with not more than six gallons (0.022
m3) of water per ninety-four-pound (42.7 kilograms) sack
of cement.
§ 353-6 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-6
1:638
[5] Bentonite grout shall be a pure bentonite with at least 20%
solids by weight when mixed with water. Hydration of the
bentonite must be delayed until bentonite mix has been
placed down the well. This can be done by using additives
with the dry bentonite or in water; mixing calcium
bentonite with sodium bentonite or by using granular
bentonite which has less surface area.
[6] In all well installations, if rapid loss of grout material
occurs during placement, coarse fill material (e.g., sand,
gravel, crushed stone, dry cement) may be used in the
zone or zones in which the rapid loss is occurring. The
remainder of the annular space shall be grouted as
provided below. In no case shall pouring, dumping or
shoveling of grout material into the annular space be
deemed an approved method of grout placement.
(3) Grout placement.
(a) Grout pipe outside casing.
[1] The minimum annular space of 1 1/2 inches around the
entire outside of the casing shall be provided by drilling a
bore hole three inches larger than the outside diameter of
the casing to be inserted. All grout shall be placed by
pumping through the grout pipe. The entire interval to be
grouted shall be open and without obstructions. Washing
or jetting with water is recommended for cleaning the bore
hole and may serve to remove obstructions caused by
casing which otherwise would prevent a proper grout. It is
recommended that the grout pipe extend from the surface
to the bottom of the interval to be grouted. The grout pipe
may remain extended to the bottom of the interval during
and after grouting, or it may be raised slowly as a grout is
placed, provided that the discharge end of the grout pipe
remains submerged in the emplaced grout at all times
until grouting is completed. In the event of interruption in
the grouting operations, the bottom of the grout pipe shall
be raised above the grout level and should not be
resubmerged until the air and water have been displaced
from the grout pipe.
[2] Grouting depths greater than 30 feet. The minimum length
of grout pipe shall be inserted into the annular space is 30
feet.
[3] Grouting depths of 30 feet and less. Grout may be placed
by a tremie pipe inserted only a short distance
(approximately five feet into the annular space, provided
that the entire interval to be grouted is clearly visible from
the surface and is dry. An annular space larger than the
§ 353-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-6
1:639
minimum 1 1/2 inches may be required to assure visibility
from the surface.
(b) Grout pipe inside casing. The bottom of the casing is fitted with
a packer arrangement, also referred to as a "cementing shoe"
or "float shoe," and the casing is placed in the bore hole a short
distance off the bottom. The float shoe allows grout to be
pumped through the grout pipe and upward into the annular
space while preventing grout leakage into the casing during
grouting and after removal of grout pipe. Grouting is continued
until cement appears at the surface, at which time the grout
pipe is disconnected from the float shoe. The float shoe is
drilled out after the grout sets and hardens sufficiently.
(c) Interior method two plug. The first plug separates the grout
from the fluid in the casing, and the other separates the grout
from the water pumped in above it. First, the casing is placed a
short distance off the bottom. After pumping water through the
casing to circulate fluid in the annular space and clear any
obstructions from the hole, the first plug is inserted, and the
casing is capped. A measured volume of grout is pumped in
which is sufficient to fill the annular space. The casing then is
opened, and the second plug inserted. A measured volume of
water is pumped in above the second plug until it is pushed to
the bottom of the casing and most of the grout is expelled up
and into the annual space. The water in the casing is held
under pressure to prevent the backflow of grout until it has set
and hardened.
(d) Interior method upper plug. The casing is placed a short
distance off the bottom, and the water is pumped into the
casing to circulate fluid through the annular space to clear any
obstructions from the hole. A measured quantity of grout
slightly greater than that needed to fill the annular space is
pumping into the capped casing. Because this grout is in direct
contact with the drilling fluid, there will be a narrow zone of
weak grout between the drilling fluid and good grout; however,
this zone should remain inside the casing and not be forced
into the annular space. The casing is opened, and a drillable
plug is inserted. A measured volume of water is pumped in
above the plug until it is pushed to the bottom of the casing and
most of the grout is expelled up and into the annular space.
The water in the casing is held under pressure until the grout
sets and hardens.
(e) Interior method capped casing. The casing is placed a short
distance off the bottom, and water is pumped into the casing to
circulate fluid in the annular space and clear any obstructions
from the hole. The grout pipe passes through an airtight cap at
the top of the casing and is positioned three to four feet above
the bottom of the casing. The grout pipe is assembled so that it
§ 353-6 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-6
1:640
can be pulled through the cap a distance of about 20 feet
after the injection of grout is completed. A bleeder valve is
provided to release air from inside the casing as it is filled with
water. The first step is to fill the casing and annular space with
water. With the upper end of the casing closed, grouting is
started by forcing the cement through the grout pipe upward
into the annular space. Grouting is continued until the cement
overflows around the casing at ground surface. Just enough
water is pumped to clear the cement from the grout pipe, and
the grout pipe is lifted free of the grout. Both the casing and
grout pipe shall be kept tightly closed under pressure until the
cement sets and hardens.
(f) Grout displacement method. The hole is filled with the
estimated volume of grout required to fill the annular space,
and the casing is lowered into the hole. The bottom of the
casing is closed in a tight, drillable plug. Guides often are used
to keep the casing centered in the hole. As the casing is
lowered, the grout is forced upward around it to fill the annular
space. If the pipe does not sink to the bottom under its own
weight, it is filled with water.
(g) Unconsolidated formations. When drilling through an
unconsolidated formation, a steel drive shoe shall be required.
Grouting shall be done in accordance with the following:
[1] If caving conditions are experienced on wells deeper than
30 feet, the annular space shall be grouted from the point
where caving occurred or from a depth of 30 feet,
whichever is greater, to land surface.
[2] If the annular space cannot be grouted in accordance with
these regulations, the well shall be abandoned and sealed
in accordance with § 353-9 of this article.
(h) Other grouting methods and materials may be used subject to
prior written approval of the Department.
(4) Packers. Packers, when used, shall be of materials that will not
impart taste, odor, toxic substances or bacterial contamination to
the well water.
(5) Well screens. Well screens, when used, shall:
(a) Provide the maximum amount of open area while still
maintaining structural strength.
(b) Have the size of openings in the screen based on a sieve
analysis of the material contained in the surrounding
geological formation or gravel pack.
§ 353-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-6
1:641
(c) Be constructed of materials resistant to damage by chemical
action of groundwater or cleaning operations.
(d) Have sufficient diameter to provide adequate specific capacity
and low-aperture velocity. Usually, the entrance velocity should
not exceed 0.1 foot per second.
(e) Be installed so that the pumping water level remains above the
screen under all operating conditions.
(f) Be designed and installed to permit removal or replacement
without adversely affecting watertight construction of the well.
(g) Be provided with a bottom place or wash-down bottom fitting
of the same material as a screen.
(6) Gravel packs. Gravel packs, when used:
(a) Shall be well rounded particles, 95% siliceous material, that
are smooth and uniform, free of foreign material, properly
sized, washed and disinfected immediately prior to or during
replacement.
(b) Shall be placed in one uniform continuous operation.
(c) Gravel refill pipes, when used, shall be Schedule 40 steel pipe
incorporated within the pump foundation and terminated with
screwed or welded caps at least 12 inches above the pump
house floor or concrete apron.
(d) Gravel refill pipes located in the grouted annular opening shall
be surrounded by a minimum of 1.5 inches of grout.
(e) Protection from leakage of grout into the gravel pack or screen
shall be provided.
(7) Pit installations. Pit installations are used where the casing
terminates below the ground surface. Where well pits are used,
such pits shall be maintained free of water at all times. The floor of
the pit shall be a watertight reinforced concrete platform at least
four inches thick poured around the casing and shall be provided
with a watertight seal. The floor of the pit shall extend at least two
feet from the center of the casing in all directions. In all cases, the
pit shall be sized to allow adequate working space. The casing shall
extend above the floor for at least 12 inches. An insect-resistant
well cap shall be installed. The surface of the floor shall be pitched
toward a drain which has a minimum diameter of four inches and
discharged by gravity to the surface of the ground in an area not
subject to flooding or to a basement which is effectively protected
against flooding. Drain openings shall be effectively screened to
prevent the entrance of insects and rodents. The drain shall not be
connected to any sewer or other drain. The pit shall have
watertight reinforced concrete walls four inches thick or equivalent
§ 353-6 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-6
1:642
which provide for an effective watertight seal against the floor. The
top of the pit shall be a watertight reinforced monolithic concrete
slab at least four inches thick, which shall be sealed with the wall
so as to effectively prevent the entrance of water. The top of the
pit shall not be more than six inches below the ground surface.
A durable watertight manhole shall be installed in the top of the
pit centered over the casing and effectively sealed with the top
to prevent the entrance of water. This manhole shall be at least
24 inches in diameter. It shall extend at least three inches above
the surrounding ground surface and be covered by an impervious
durable cover of concrete, steel or equivalent material which
overlaps the manhole vertically by at least two inches. The manhole
cover shall be effectively secured to the manhole by bolting, locking
or equivalent means and shall be kept so secured. Pit installations
shall not be used in areas subject to flooding by groundwater or
surface water or where the groundwater level rises to within one
foot of the bottom of the proposed pit. Where pipes enter the
pit, the annular space between the pipes and the wall shall be
effectively sealed by a watertight permanent seal.
(8) Pitless installations. Pitless installations are those installations
where the casing terminates above the ground surface.
(a) Where pitless installations are used, they shall be of a design
which provides an effective seal against the entrance of
groundwater or surface water into the well, access casing and
into the piping leading to the pump. All buried suction lines
shall be effectively encased or otherwise protected to prevent
external damage or contamination. Pitless installations must
be so designed as to be structurally sound and to provide for
ready removal of drop piping without excavation. The access
casing shall be effectively protected against corrosion and
shall extend at least 18 inches above the natural ground
surface and to a point below the frost line. The ground level at
this point shall be elevated above the adjacent ground level
and graded to drain away in all directions. The top of the
access shall be effectively sealed against the entrance of
waters, insects and rodents. An insect resistant cap shall be
installed. The pitless adapter shall not be submerged in water
or used in areas used by automobiles and other vehicles.
(b) Where surface installations (i.e., hand pumps, pump rooms,
etc.) are used, a watertight reinforced-concrete platform at
least four inches thick and extending for at least two feet in all
directions from the center of the casing shall be poured around
the casing to provide an effective watertight seal with the
casing, or it shall be made watertight with an effective
permanent seal. The surface of the platform shall slope to the
edges. The casing shall extend through the slab for a least 12
inches and shall be effectively sealed against the entrance of
§ 353-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-6
1:643

of the operational status of the well. This shall be required on an
annual basis within 30 days of the anniversary of the original
issuance date of the permit for each monitoring well.
(5) When a monitoring well is no longer going to be actively used, it
shall be considered as an abandoned well according to § 353-4 of
this article and is required to be sealed in accordance with the
abandonment procedures given in § 353-9.
(6) Failure to comply with the above requirements relating to
ownership, reporting and the operation, maintenance or
abandonment of any monitoring well may result in legal action
being initiated against the property owner by this Department.
B. Test wells.
(1) Test wells require a permit and must meet the isolation distances
and construction standards of § 353-6B of this article for water
supply wells.
(2) Test wells are temporary and therefore are not permitted as
permanent supply wells. Once the intended use of the well has been
completed, the well shall be considered abandoned according to
§ 353-4 of this article and shall be sealed according to § 353-9.
(3) Test wells may be converted for use as a permanent supply well. To
be converted for use as a supply well, the owner shall submit a new
§ 353-7 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-7

geologic log (No. FM-TGS-15) and well completion form (No.
WTWSD-01 and WTWSD-01-1) must be submitted.
(4) The converted test well will not be granted approval for use until a
copy of the pump completion information form (No. WTWSD-02)
and a water quality analysis showing that the water meets the
requirements of § 353-13 is submitted to this Department. In
addition, documentation that the supply well meets the individual
supply system standard in § 353-6B(10) and minimum yield
requirements in § 353-6B(11) must be submitted to this
Department prior to well approval.
(5) Failure to comply with these regulations regarding test wells may
result in the initiation of legal action against the property owner by
this Department.
A. Head pump installations.
(1) The pump head shall be designed and constructed to prevent
contamination from reaching the water chamber and other interior
surfaces of the pump.
(2) The pump shall be designed and constructed to provide an effective
watertight seal with the well casing or stored water reservoir.
(3) The pump cylinder or foot valve shall be installed below the
pumping level of the well.
(4) The pump shall be designed where necessary for protection against
freezing.
(5) All pump information must be submitted in writing on Department
form WTWSD-02 within 30 days of the installation of the pump.

1:647
§ 353-9. Abandonment of wells.
The Department must be notified in writing within 30 days by the well
contractor and/or property owner when a well meets the criteria of an
abandoned well under § 353-4 of this article. All wells considered to be
abandoned shall be filled and sealed by a Department-licensed well
contractor in accordance with the procedures for abandonment listed in this
subsection. Written notification and proper documentation of abandonment
shall be submitted to the Department within 30 days from the point that
the subject well has met the criteria of or otherwise been determined to
be an abandoned well according to § 353-4. One of the following methods
of abandonment described below must be used in accordance with the
geological formations penetrated and in such a manner as to prevent the
bore hole being sealed from acting as a channel for pollution or the escape
of subterranean gases. A report, as required above, of the method of sealing
shall be filed with the Department (Form WTWSD-05).
(4) Location and installation of the pump and all related equipment
shall permit convenient access, removal, maintenance and repair.
(5) The pump suction opening shall be placed at least two feet below
the maximum drawdown of the water in the well. However, the
pump suction opening shall be placed at a sufficient distance from
the bottom of the well so as to prevent agitation of accumulated
sediment.
C. Well cap replacement. Whenever a pump is repaired or replaced, the
pump installer shall ensure that an insect-resistant well cap is installed
on the well. Caps other than insect-resistant caps shall be replaced with
insect-resistant caps. If an existing insect-resistant cap is to be
reinstalled on a well, the pump installer shall inspect the condition of
the cap and either clean or replace the cap as necessary to ensure that
the integrity and operation of the well is maintained. The new well cap
should be a watertight locking cap with O-ring seals.
A. A well in unconsolidated deposits shall be filled with neat cement grout
or concrete grout.
B. The section of a well in a cavernous or creviced rock (such as cavernous
limestone or diabase, creviced granite, etc.) shall be filled with concrete
or neat cement grout or alternate layers of concrete or neat cement
grout, gravel or stone aggregate. The filling shall be completed at the
top by a layer of neat cement grout, concrete grout or bentonite
extending at least 20 feet (6.1 meters) above the top of the cavernous
rock or to the ground surface.
C. The section of a wall in sandstone strata shall be filled with neat cement
grout, concrete grout or sand. The filling shall be completed at the top
of the formation by a layer of neat cement grout, concrete grout or
bentonite extending at least 20 feet (6.1 meters) above the top of the
sandstone or to the ground surface.
§ 353-8 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-9
1:648
§ 353-10. Disinfection.
D. The flow in a flowing well shall be confined and the well filled in
accordance with preceding paragraphs, or the well shall be sealed by
pressure grouting.
E. Abandonment of wells containing subterranean gases requires special
precautions, and a casing in such a well shall be sealed with neat
cement grout, concrete grout or bentonite.
F. Debris or obstructions that may interfere with sealing operations shall
be removed from the well.
A. Following the completion of the construction of an individual,
semipublic water or public supply and installation of the pumping
equipment, or alterations, repairs or maintenance work, the well shall
be pumped continuously until the water discharged is clear. The well,
pump, piping system and other fixtures shall be filled with water
containing a concentration of not less than 100 parts per million of free
chlorine. A portion of the chlorine solution shall be recirculated directly
to the well in order to ensure proper agitation. The water shall not be
used for a period of 24 hours. Other combinations of concentration and
time intervals may be used as are demonstrated to be equally effective.
B. Disposal of the purged water shall be at a point so as to minimize
adverse effects to aquatic life, and, further, the purged water shall not
be discharged into any subsurface sewage disposal system. One ounce
(28 g/0.8 kg) of dry calcium hypochlorite (70% available chlorine),
dissolved in 52.5 gallons (200 liters) of water, makes a 100 ppm
strength disinfectant solution. Various proportions can be worked out

[Adopted 2-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-O-03]
§ 353-29. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is:
§ 353-30. Application and policy.
§ 353-31. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AIR GAP SEPARATION  The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the
flood level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance shall be at least
double the diameter (2 x D) of the supply pipe measured vertically above
the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall the air gap be less than one
inch.
A. To protect the public water supply from contamination or pollution by
isolating, within the consumer's water system, contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the
public water supply system.
B. To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's water supply and
nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or systems
containing process fluids.
C. To provide for the maintenance and continuation of a cross-connection
control program which prevents the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer's water supply.
A. This article shall apply to all premises (commercial and noncommercial)
served by the Township's water supply system.
B. The Township and the consumer have the joint responsibility for
protection of the public water supply from contamination or pollution
due to backflow. If the Township requires an approved backflow
prevention device, the Township or its authorize representative, shall
give notice to the consumer to install such an approved backflow
prevention device at each service connection to the premises. The
consumer shall install such an approved device or devices at his own
expense within 90 days of receiving notification. Failure, refusal, or
inability on the part of the consumer to install such a device or devices
shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises
until such a device or devices have been installed.
§ 353-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-31
1:671
APPROVED  A backflow prevention device or method that has been
accepted by the Township as suitable for the proposed use.
ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER (AVB)  A fixture outlet device
containing an optional shutoff valve followed by a valve body containing
a soft-seated float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. If the shutoff
valve is open, the flow of water causes the float to close the air inlet port.
If the shutoff valve is closed, the float falls and forms a check valve against
backsiphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port. If no shutoff
valve is provided, the flow of water will determine the opening and closing
of the air inlet port.
AUXILIARY WATER SYSTEM  Any water source or system on the premises
of, or available to, the customer except connections to other approved
community water supply systems.
BACKFLOW  A flow condition, induced by a differential in pressure, that
causes the flow of water or mixtures of water and other substances into
the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from a source other
than its intended source. Backflow can result from either backsiphonage or
backpressure.
BACKFLOW PREVENTER  A device or other means which will prevent
the backflow of water or any other substance into the public water supply
system.
BACKPRESSURE  The backflow of water or a mixture of water and
other substances from a plumbing fixture or other customer source, into a
public water supply system due to an increase of pressure in the fixture or
customer source to a value that exceeds the system pressure.
BACKSIPHONAGE  The backflow of water or a mixture of water and
other substances from a plumbing fixture or other customer source, into a
public water supply system due to a temporary negative or sub-atmospheric
pressure within the public water supply system.
CONSUMER  The owner or person in control of any premises supplied by
or in any manner connected to a public water supply system.
CONSUMER'S WATER SYSTEM  Any water system, located on the
consumer's premises, supplied by or in any manner connected to a public
water supply system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a
consumer's water system.
CONTAINMENT  Cross-connection control which isolates the customer's
entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply
in the event of backflow from the customer's facility. Though containment
control prevents contamination of the public water supply, it offers no
protection to the water distribution system within the facility. Reduced
pressure zone devices are used for containment control.
CONTAMINATION  The degradation of the quality of the drinking water
by wastewaters, processed fluids, or any water of a quality less than
accepted drinking water quality to a degree which would create an actual
§ 353-31 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-31
1:672
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION  An arrangement allowing either a direct or
indirect connection through which backflow, including backsiphonage, can
occur between the drinking water in a public water system and a system
containing a source or potential source of contamination, or allowing
treated water to be removed from any public water system, used for any
purpose or routed through any device or pipes outside the public water
system, and returned to the public water system. The term does not include
connections to devices totally within the control of one or more public water
systems and connections between water mains.
DEGREE OF HAZARD  An evaluation of the potential risk to health and
the adverse effect upon the public water supply system.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA)  An assembly composed of
two single, independently acting, soft-seated, spring-loaded check valves
including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly
and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each check valve.
FIXTURE OUTLET PROTECTION  Cross-connection control which
isolates all free-flowing fixture outlets (i.e., faucets) from the water
distribution system within a facility. Fixture outlet protection prevents
backflow contamination of both the facility water system and the public
water supply. Examples of fixture outlet protection devices include
atmospheric vacuum breakers, hose-bibb vacuum breakers, and pressure
vacuum breakers.
HEALTH HAZARD  Any condition, device, or practice in a water system or
its operation that creates, or may create, a danger to the health and wellbeing
of its users. The word "severe," as used to qualify "health hazard,"
means a hazard to the health of the user that could reasonably be expected
to result in significant morbidity or death.
HOSE-BIBB VACUUM BREAKER (HBVB)  A fixture outlet device which
contains a soft-seated, spring-loaded, air inlet valve and is designed to be
attached to an outlet having a hose connection thread.
INTERCHANGEABLE CONNECTION  An arrangement or device that will
allow alternate, but not simultaneous, use of two sources of water.
INTERNAL PROTECTION  Cross-connection control which isolates all
non-outlet, water-use appliances within a facility (e.g., kitchen appliances,
air conditioners, boilers, process tanks, photo developing equipment) from
the water distribution system within the facility. Internal protection
prevents backflow contamination of both the facility water system and the
public water supply. Reduced pressure zone devices and double check valve

§ 353-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-36
1:677
§ 353-37. Backflow prevention devices.
§ 353-38. Installation.
C. An approved air gap separation, an approved reduced pressure zone
device, or an approved double check valve assembly shall be installed
where the public water supply system may be polluted with substances
that would be objectionable but not dangerous to health.
A. Any backflow prevention device required by this article shall be of a
model or construction approved by the Township or its designated
representative and shall comply with the following:
(1) Air gap separation to be approved shall be at least twice the
diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the top rim
of the receiving vessel, but in no case less than one inch.
(2) A double check valve assembly or a reduced pressure zone device
shall be approved by the Township and shall mean a device that has
been manufactured in full conformance with standards established
by the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE) entitled:
(a) ASSE/ANSI 1015 Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow
Assemblies;
(b) ASSE/ANSI 1013 Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle

B. Existing backflow prevention devices approved by the Township at the
time of installation and properly maintained shall, except for inspection
and maintenance requirements, be excluded from the requirement of
§ 353-37A of this article provided the Township is assured that they will
satisfactorily protect the public water supply system. Whenever the
existing device is moved from the present location, or requires more
than minimum maintenance, or when the Township finds that the
maintenance of the device constitutes a hazard to health, the device
shall be replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the
requirements of this article.
§ 353-36 WARRINGTON CODE § 353-38
1:678
§ 353-39. Inspection and maintenance.
A. Backflow prevention devices required by this article shall be installed at
a location, and in a manner, approved by the Township. The device(s)
shall be installed by a person properly qualified. Installation of the
devices shall be at the expense of the water consumer.
B. Backflow prevention devices installed on the service line to a
consumer's water system shall be located on the consumer's side of the
water meter, as close to the meter as is reasonably practical, and prior
to any other connection.
C. Pits or vaults shall be water-tight, flood-free, and maintained free from
standing water by means of either a sump and pump or a suitable drain.
Such a pump or drain shall not connect to a sanitary sewer, nor permit
flooding of the pit or vault by reverse flow from its point of discharge.
An access ladder and adequate lighting, natural or artificial, shall be
provided to permit maintenance, inspection, and testing of the backflow
prevention device.
D. When installing a backflow prevention assembly the installer must
comply with the IPC and ASSE/ANSI standards and be aware of all
OSHA safety considerations when installations are performed. Major
safety considerations are thermal expansion and assembly discharge
damage. Thermal expansion can cause hot water tanks and other
storage vessels to explode when there are no provisions made for
thermal expansion. Township strongly recommends the installation of a
thermal expansion tank on hot water heaters to prevent the hot water
heaters relief valve from discharging or, more importantly, from
exploding. Many backflow prevention assemblies discharge large
amounts of water for various reasons. This discharge of water could
obviously pose a hazard when the valves are discharging onto or around
electrical equipment. Equipment damage or electrocution could occur.
The installer must ensure that valve discharge will not cause safety
hazards or property damage. Thermal expansion is a concern anytime
substances are confined (in a closed system) and are heated.
A. It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises on which backflow
prevention devices are required by this article to have inspections,
tests, and overhaul made in accordance with the following schedule, or
more often where inspections indicate a need.
(1) Air separation shall be inspected at the time of installation, and at
least every 12 months thereafter.
(2) Double check valve assemblies shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation, and at least every 12 months
thereafter. These devices shall be dismantled, inspected internally,
cleaned, and repaired whenever needed, and at least every 30
months.
§ 353-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 353-39
1:679
§ 353-40. Booster pumps.
§ 353-41. Violations.
(3) Reduced pressure zone devices shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation, and at least every 12 months
thereafter. These devices shall be dismantled, inspected internally,
cleaned, and repaired whenever needed and at least every five
years.
(4) Pressure vacuum breakers shall be inspected and tested for the
capability to prevent backsiphonage at the time of installation and
at least every 12 months thereafter. These devices shall be
dismantled, inspected internally, cleaned, and repaired whenever
needed and at least every 12 months.
B. Inspections, tests, and overhaul of backflow prevention devices shall be
made at the expense of the water consumer, and shall be performed by
a person certified to inspect, test, and overhaul backflow prevention
devices.
C. Whenever backflow prevention devices required by this article are
found to be defective, they shall be repaired or replaced at the expense
of the consumer without delay.
D. The water consumer must maintain a complete record of each backflow
prevention device from purchase to retirement. This shall include a
comprehensive listing that includes a record of all tests, inspections,
and repairs. Records of installation, inspections, tests, repairs, and
overhaul shall be submitted to the Township or the Township's
designee, within 30 days, on a form provided by the Township.
E. Backflow prevention devices shall not be bypassed, made inoperative,
removed, or otherwise made ineffective without specific authorization
by the Township. Bypasses are only permitted when matched protection
is provided meaning that the bypass must contain the same level of
protection as the primary service line. On a parallel service connection,
backflow prevention assemblies must be of the same size and type.
A. Where a booster pump has been installed on the service line to, or
within, any premises, such a pump shall be equipped with a lowpressure
cut-off device designed to shutoff the booster pump when the
pressure in the service line on the suction side of the pump drops to 10
pounds per square inch gauge pressure or less for a period of 30
seconds or longer.
B. It shall be the duty of the water consumer to maintain the low-pressure
cut-off device in proper working order and to certify to the Township, at
least once a year, that the device is operating properly.
A. The Township may deny or discontinue, after issuing reasonable notice,
the water service to any premises wherein any backflow prevention

uses. Open space shall be a parcel or parcels of land, or an area
of water, or a combination of land and water on a site which are
logically interrelated, interconnected, and designed for the stated use.
Open space does not include streets or rights-of-way, required yards or
lot areas or parking areas. Open space shall be substantially free of
structures but may contain such improvements as finally approved as
appropriate for the recreation of the residents. Open space may include
environmentally sensitive areas, unless otherwise noted below.
A.
Open space shall consist of two types, common and active open space:
COMMON OPEN SPACE (COS)  All open space, except active
open space. Common open space may contain subsurface and
drainage structures, utilities, etc., as determined to be necessary
by the Township, provided they are properly restricted and subject
to necessary easements to the satisfaction of the Township.
(1)
ACTIVE OPEN SPACE (SOS)  A parcel of land which is generally
flat, dry and clear of any vegetation other than grass, and which
is suitable as an active recreation area and developed according
to the Township's Comprehensive Plan standards. The recreation
facilities and design of open space shall be subject to the approval
of the Board of Supervisors. Common recreation areas shall not be
considered part of an active open space area.
(2)

combination of the following ways upon approval of the Township.
Active open space may only use the "dedicated" or "development" form
of ownership.
DEED-RESTRICTED AREAS  Required open space which is
contained within the deeded lot areas of individual residential
lots. Deed-restricted open space shall not be used to calculate the
minimum lot areas required by Township ordinances; shall not be

kept free of all structures which would limit or preclude the use or
access of the open space areas, except for those structures or other
facilities associated with storm drainage or other utilities.

and unloading areas. It does not include areas allotted for commercial
loading and unloading. These areas shall be calculated based on actual
suitable for use as park and open space, and shall have suitable
access as determined by the Board. In general, land to be dedicated
shall have an area of not less than five acres. If a tract of less
than five acres would result, the Board may require such land to
be located on the periphery of the development so that a tract of
sufficient size will result when additional open space is obtained via
dedication when adjacent land is developed. In no case, however,
shall an area of less than 2.5 acres be dedicated if it would be
impractical or impossible to secure additional adjacent land in the
future.
DEVELOPMENT OWNERSHIP OF COMMON OPEN SPACE 
Areas set aside for open space use and governed by the
establishment of an organization of development residents for the
ownership and administration of the area pursuant to § 705(d)(1)
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247), as
amended.137
(3)
If it is determined that open space land as represented on a subdivision
or land development plan is not suitable with regard to the size, shape,
location, access or provisions for maintenance, the Township may, at
the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, require that open space
be provided through payment of a fee in lieu of land and/or facilities.
This fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the acreage that
would otherwise be dedicated pursuant to this section, as stated in the
adopted Fee Schedule. Such payment shall be made to the Warrington
Township Parks and Recreation Board, to be used for the acquisition,
development, or improvement of open space land that will be available
and accessible to and that will benefit the residents of the development.
This option is available in all zoning districts within the Township in
which open space is required.

§ 370-302. Zoning Map. [Amended 3-17-1992 by Ord. No. 92-3]
The Zoning Map of Warrington Township, which is dated March 3, 1992, is
incorporated by reference into this chapter and shall be, with all notations,
references, and data shown thereon, made a part of this chapter.
§ 370-303. District boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district as shown on said
map, the following rules shall apply:
§ 370-304. Resource protection. [Amended 7-19-1988 by Ord. No.
88-12; 10-25-1994 by Ord. No. 94-15A]
A. District boundary lines are intended to follow the center line of streets
and streams, and lot or property lines as they exist on plans of record at
the time of the adoption of this chapter, unless such district boundary
lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the Zoning Map.
B. Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows a lot line, and where it does not scale more than
10 feet therefrom, such lot lines shall be construed to be such
boundaries unless specifically shown otherwise.
C. In unsubdivided land or where a district boundary divides a lot, the
location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions,
shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.
D. In case further uncertainty exists, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
interpret the intent of the map as to location of district boundaries.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the resource protection overlay is to identify
those areas in which environmental restrictions must be applied in
order to achieve the resource protection objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan. It is the intent of these regulations to identify only
those areas in which development must be restricted in order to protect
valuable environmental resources.
B. Establishment of overlay district.
(1) The boundary and limits of "resource protection areas" are
generally as shown on the environmental restrictions overlay map
of the Warrington Township Growth Management Plan. The
boundaries of a resource protection overlay district shall be subject
to a resource protection area study on a site-specific basis. The
precise boundary of the overlay district and the enforcement of the
development limitations shall be subject to requirements of this
chapter and Chapter 305, Subdivision and Land Development.
(2) Additional requirements for the protection and preservation of
environmentally sensitive areas, other than those listed in this
chapter as resource protection areas, shall be regulated in Chapter
§ 370-302 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-304
1:718
305, Subdivision and Land Development, under § 305-327,
Environmental performance standards.
C. Applicability. The resource protection regulations and standards
contained herein shall be applicable to all zoning districts in Warrington
Township.
D. Procedure for establishing land use intensities.
(1) To establish the permitted land use intensity for any tract of land,
the applicant shall prepare maps and perform the calculations
specified in §§ 370-305 to 370-307 herein.
(2) Following determination of the gross buildable site area, the
applicant shall develop a site plan based upon the zoning
requirements of the applicable zoning district.
(3) The number of dwelling units permitted on the tract shall be
determined by one of the following methods:
(a) Where minimum lot areas are determinative of land use
intensities (that is, where no maximum density requirements
are specified), the maximum number of units shall be
determined by the maximum number of lots that can be sited
on the tract. In making this determination, restricted resource
protection areas must be designated as common open space
except where specifically permitted as part of lot areas in
§ 370-305.
(b) Where maximum density requirements are determinative (that
is, where maximum density requirements are specified and
minimum lot areas may or may not be specified), the maximum
number of dwelling units shall be determined by the density
applied to the gross buildable site area (GBSA).
E. Procedures for delineating the environmental restriction and
establishing the gross buildable site area. To establish the gross
buildable site area and net gross buildable site area for any tract
proposed for development, the applicant shall prepare the following
maps and perform the following calculations (which calculations are to
be made in accordance with § 370-307).
(1) Submit a map at the same scale as the gross site area map, locating
all reserved land (RL) and resource protection areas.
(2) The reserved land area map shall include the following:
(a) All existing roads and utility rights-of-way and easements.
(b) All ultimate rights-of-way for existing streets as specified in
Appendix C of Chapter 305, Subdivision and Land
Development, of the Code of the Township of Warrington, and/
§ 370-304 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-304
1:719
or all future street rights-of-way and other land reserved by
virtue of the official Township Map.
(c) All land shown on previously recorded subdivisions or land
developments for use as open space or for natural resource
protection.
(3) The resource protection areas map shall include the following:
(a) Identification of areas.
[1] Streams, Type I.
[2] Water body, Type I.
[3] Wetlands.
[4] Steep slopes shall be mapped as follows:
[a] Areas containing slopes of 25% or more.
[b] Areas with a slope of between 25% and 15%.
[c] Areas with a slope of between 15% and 8%.
[5] Forest areas.
[6] All prime agricultural soils within the RA Residential
Agricultural District only. [Amended 4-26-2011 by Ord.
No. 2011-O-04]
(b) Mapping of area. The area of each individual component of the
resource protection area shall be computed and the acreage
shall be itemized and shown on the map. Areas of overlap shall
be indicated. Where alternative methods of identifying
protection areas are indicated, the map shall indicate the
parameters used. For example, both the HUD floodplain and
soil lines shall be indicated for stream delineation.
(4) The restricted resource protection area shall be determined by
applying the environmental restriction standards to the total of
each individual component of resource protection areas.
(5) The gross buildable site area (GBSA) shall be calculated by
subtracting the total of the reserved land (RL) and the portion of
the restricted area designated as totally unusable land (TUL) from
the gross site area (GSA).
(6) The net gross buildable site area shall be calculated by subtracting
the portion of the restricted protection area designated as partially
unusable land (PUL) from the gross buildable site area (GBSA).

3-7-1995 by Ord. No. 95-5]
A. Streams, Type I. All Type I streams shall represent totally unusable land
and shall be 100% restricted for purpose of calculating restricted
resource protection areas. Such restricted land must be designated as
common open space and may only be disturbed for purposes of roads,
dams, culverts, water-impounding basins and stormwater and utility
construction. Such construction must be in accordance with state and
federal regulatory agency approval. No structures or impervious
surfaces shall be permitted.
B. Water body, Type I. All Type I water bodies shall represent totally
unusable land and shall be 100% restricted. This land must be
designated as common open space and may only be disturbed for road
or bridge construction in accordance with state and federal regulatory
agency approval. No structures, filling, pipes or diverting of water shall
be permitted except as stated above.
C. Wetland. All wetlands shall represent totally unusable land and shall be
100% restricted. This land must be designated as common open space
and may not be disturbed except as permitted by state and federal
regulatory agencies. If wetland disturbance is approved by state and
federal regulatory agencies, the area shall still be considered 100%
restricted for purposes of determining building densities.
D. Steep slopes.
(1) In areas of steep slopes (i.e., those slopes in excess of 8%), a
portion of the area will be considered restricted resource
protection area as partially unusable land and shall be subject to
certain development limitations. A restricted area shall be based on
the severity of the slope. Regardless of allocation of restricted area,
it shall not be disturbed by regrading or stripping of vegetation.
(a) Slopes between 8% and 15%: A minimum of 60% of this area
shall be considered restricted.
(b) Slopes between 15% and 25%: A minimum of 70% of this area
should be considered restricted.
(c) Slopes in excess of 25%: A minimum of 85% of this area shall
be considered restricted.
(2) Within the RA Residential Agricultural District, the Township may
waive the partly usable land restrictions and recommend greater
encroachment into the areas of steep slopes in order to ensure the
best design of a site for agricultural purposes.
E. Forest.

307,139 provided by the Township. The required open space calculations,
designated areas and recreational facilities shall be so noted on the
subdivision and land development plan(s) in the preliminary or sketch plan
submission. Open space requirements are applicable to all residential and
commercial subdivision and land development and to all planned residential
developments, except for conservation residential developments pursuant
to § 370-405.
(1) Forests in varying degrees provide wildlife habitat, recreational
opportunities and buffers between adjacent land uses. Forests also
mitigate environmental stress by reducing stormwater runoff,
filtering groundwater recharge, controlling erosion and
sedimentation, moderating regional micro-climates and purifying
air. Structures are to be located in forested areas with a minimal
amount of clearing. Forests are an important part of the
environment and protecting 50% of a forest on a development site
is the minimum standard.
(2) In order to promote forest protection, the Township requires
protection of a minimum of 50% of a forest on a site and 80% when
it is associated with another environmentally sensitive resource.

(a) Standards for single-family detached residential development
using transferable development rights.
[1] In the RA District, transferable development rights may be
utilized for the development of single-family detached
dwellings when authorized by the Board of Supervisors
pursuant to a conditional use procedure. In the R-1, R-3,
R-21 and R-1-C Districts, TDRs may be utilized only for the
development of single-family detached dwellings. In the
R-2 District, TDRs may be utilized for either or both singlefamily
detached and two-family semidetached dwellings
when authorized by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to a
conditional use procedure. A single-family detached and
two-family semidetached residential development utilizing
transferable development rights shall be known as a
"subdivision with transferable development rights" or
"TDR subdivision."
[2] Density, area and dimensional criteria for a subdivision
with transferable development rights. The density area
and dimensional criteria for a subdivision with
transferable development rights in the R-1-C District shall
be identical to those expressed in § 370-1212.

18, 1997, a ten-foot-wide easement with buffer plantings in accordance
with the requirements of Chapter 305, Subdivision and Land
Development, or a solid fence shall be provided along the portion of
the common boundary line which lies within 200 feet of the existing
dwelling. The area of the required easement shall be included in the
calculation of the minimum lot area.
(b) Standards for use of transferable development rights in
nonresidential zoning districts.
[1] General standards. In order to facilitate and encourage the
use of the transferable development rights in the PI-1,
PI-2, OI, IU, I-U-A, I-U-A1, I-U-B, CR/O, CBD, C-1 and C-2
Zoning Districts, development criteria otherwise
applicable to development in those districts shall be
modified for developments utilizing transferable
development rights according to the criteria set forth
hereinbelow. These criteria shall apply in lieu of the
criteria set forth in regulations governing development in
each of the enumerated districts.
[a] Alternative dimensional criteria. Minimum setbacks,
building separations, isolation distances and buffer
yard requirements shall be modified according to the
following table:
Maximum Dimensional Reduction Applied to
Setbacks, Separations, Gross Site Area,
Isolation, and Buffers
One transferable development right shall be
used for each type of reduction applied to a
subdivision or land development plan.
Acres Maximum
0.99 acres or less 45% maximum
1.0 acre to 2.00 acres 40% maximum
3.0 acres to 9.99 acres 35% maximum
10.0 acres or more 30% maximum
[b] There shall be no dimensional setback or buffer yard
required from adjacent residential uses if the
residential use is nonconforming.
§ 370-411 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-411
1:741
[c] A minimum ten-foot separation between parking areas
and buildings shall be maintained for all
nonresidential sites.
[d] A minimum fifteen-foot-wide planted buffer yard along
the ultimate right-of-way of all streets on which the
proposed development has frontage (including
sidewalks, where required) shall be provided.
[e] A minimum distance of 20 feet between buildings
where more than one building is proposed in a land
development.
[f] A minimum building setback of 50 feet.
[g] The number of parking spaces required by the
provisions of this chapter with respect to any
nonresidential use may be reduced by 20% of the
minimum requirement for nonresidential
developments utilizing transferable development
rights where such reduction is supported by a traffic
study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer. The
Board of Supervisors may, in its discretion, approve a
greater reduction where the Board is satisfied that the
parking proposed by the applicant will be adequate for
the proposed use.
[h] Within any required buffer yard, the buffer plantings
for proposed developments utilizing transferable
development rights shall be increased by a factor of
1 1/2 times the planting otherwise required for such
use under the provisions of Chapter 305, Subdivision
and Land Development, of the Code of the Town of
Warrington.
[i] The following sections allow a transferable
development right to be used for additional
impervious surface coverage, inclusive of building
coverage. For example, in the PI-1 District:
[i] One TDR might be used for up to 10,000 square
feet of pavements, provided that the total
impervious surfaces do not exceed 85%;
[ii] One TDR might be used for up to 6,000 square
feet of pavements, provided that the total
impervious surfaces do not exceed 85%, and
4,000 square feet of building coverage, provided
that the total building coverage does not exceed
45%; or
§ 370-411 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-411
1:742
[iii] One TDR might be used for up to 8,000 square
feet of pavements, provided that the total
impervious surfaces do not exceed 85%, and
2,000 square feet of building coverage, provided
that the total building coverage does not exceed
45%, or any combination of impervious coverage
and building coverage within the limits
established.

H. If it is determined that open space land as represented on a subdivision
or land development plan is not suitable with regard to the size, shape,
location, access or provisions for maintenance, the Township may, at
the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, require that open space be
provided through payment of a fee in lieu of land and/or facilities. This
fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the acreage that would
otherwise be dedicated pursuant to this section, as stated in the
adopted fee schedule. Such payment shall be made to the Warrington
Township Park and Recreation Board, to be used for the acquisition,
development, or improvement of open space land that will be available
and accessible to, and that will benefit the residents of the
development. This option is available in all zoning districts within the
Township in which open space is required.145
I. At the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, forests may be
disturbed in excess of the amount permitted in § 370-305E, where TDRs
are to be applied to a site only if the amount disturbed in excess of the
amount otherwise permitted is replaced on site, or at another site
within the Township as directed by the Township, or a fee in lieu thereof
is provided to the Township. All replacement trees shall be in
accordance with the following standards outlined in the Warrington
Township Code, Chapter 305, Subdivision and Land Development,
§ 305-325 (henceforth called the "Landscape Ordinance"), as currently
revised by Ord. No. 2012-O-04, and as may be revised hereafter from
time to time.
(1) The following are considered priorities for location of replacement
trees:
(a) Establish or enhance forests within or adjacent to riparian
buffers.
(b) Establish or enhance forests on one-hundred-year floodplains,
when appropriate.
(c) Establish or enhance forest corridors to connect existing
forests within or adjacent to the site; and, where practical,
forest corridors should be a minimum of 300 feet in width to
facilitate wildlife movement.
(d) Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to critical habitats
where appropriate.
(e) Establish forest areas adjacent to existing forests to increase
the overall area of contiguous forest cover.
145. Editor's Note: Original Subsection F, regarding receipt of transferable development rights
to the RA District from Tax Map Parcel No. 50-10-13, which immediately preceded this
subsection, was repealed 7-10-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-O-07.
§ 370-411 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-411
1:745
(f) Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to areas of
differing land use or adjacent to highways or utility rights-ofway.
(2) The replacement trees used in the reforestation shall be native to
the Township or other trees approved by the Township in
accordance with the Landscape Ordinance.
(3) All tree replacement shall be conducted in conformance with state
and federal best management practices.
(4) All tree replacement shall be completed prior to the recordation of
the approved subdivision or land development plan or be
guaranteed to be completed pursuant to the development/financial
security agreements. All tree replacement areas shall be
maintained until 18 months after completion of construction upon
the site and acceptance of the public improvements by the
Township.
(5) All tree replacement shall occur upon nonbuildable areas of the
site, including open space, recreation lands, buffers (but shall be in
addition to any buffer requirements), stormwater management
BMPs, and other such areas. No tree replacement shall occur upon
residential building lots.
(6) Forest conservation fund. If an applicant subject to this section
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that
the requirements for tree replacement cannot be reasonably
accomplished on-site or off-site, the applicant shall contribute a feein-
lieu-of, at a rate to be established by the Board of Supervisors.
(7) Retention. The following trees, shrubs, plants, and specific areas
shall be granted priority for retention and protection and shall be
left in an undisturbed condition unless the applicant has
demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, that
reasonable efforts have been made to protect them and the plan
cannot be reasonably altered:
(a) Trees, shrubs, and plants located in the following sensitive
ecological areas: steep slopes, riparian buffers, one-hundredyear
floodplain, floodplain soils, streams, watercourses, waters
of the commonwealth, waters of the Unites States, lakes,
ponds, wetland margins, and critical habitats.
(b) Any part of a contiguous forest that is 10 acres or larger.
(c) Trees, shrubs or plants determined to be rare, threatened or
endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act of
1973 in 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 through 1544, and in 50 CFR Part 17,
or placed upon the Pennsylvania Threatened Species List or

required easement shall be included in the calculation of the minimum
lot area.
A. Pursuant to the enabling legislation contained in § 619.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. § 10619.1,
there are hereby created, as a separate estate in land, transferable
development rights (TDRs). TDRs are severable from the land itself and
are separately conveyable from the estate in fee simple to which they
are applicable.
B. TDRs shall be conveyed by a deed duly recorded in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which deed shall
contain the approval of the Board of Supervisors of Warrington
Township, dated not more than 60 days prior to the recording thereof.
C. No TDRs created by this section shall be transferable beyond the
boundaries of Warrington Township.
D. TDRs are created appurtenant to Bucks County Tax Map Parcel Nos.
50-4-153 and 50-4-164 (Urwiler) and the 39.8526-acre portion of Bucks
County Tax Map Parcel No. 50-10-15 described in Exhibit "A" hereto.147
The actual number of TDRs available for transfer from Tax Map Parcel
50-4-153 and 50-4-164 (Urwiler) shall be equal to 26 plus the difference
between 177 and the number of lots available for development for
single-family detached houses as shown on a subdivision plan given
final approval by the Board of Supervisors, up to a maximum of 79. The
actual number of TDRs available for transfer from the 39.8526 acre
tract of land, being a portion of Bucks County Tax Map Parcel No.
50-10-15 described on Exhibit "A" hereto, shall be equal to 115. There
shall be no TDRs appurtenant to the remainder of Bucks County Tax
Map Parcel No. 50-10-15.
E. The TDRs created appurtenant to Bucks County Tax Map Parcels
50-4-153 and 50-4-164 (Urwiler) may be transferred to any property
147. Editor's Note: Exhibit "A" is on file in the Township office.
§ 370-603 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-607

§ 370-608. Special provisions for development.
TDRs may only be used for the development of single-family detached
dwellings. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
following standards shall apply to the development of single-family
detached dwellings in the RA-2 District:
located in the RA Residential Agricultural District, R-1 Low-Density
Residential District, R-2 Medium-Density Residential District, R-3
Single-Family Residential District, R-2I Residential Infill District, CR/
O Corridor Residential/Office District, OI Office Industrial District, PI-1
Planned Industrial District, PI-2 Planned Industrial District, C-1
Commercial District, C-2 Commercial District and/or CBD Central
Business District. The TDRs created appurtenant to the 39.8526 acre
portion of Bucks County Tax Map Parcel No. 50-10-15 may be
transferred to any property located in the CR/O Corridor Residential/
Office District, OI Office Industrial District, PI-1 Planned Industrial
District, PI-2 Planned Industrial District, C-1 Commercial District, C-2
Commercial District and/or CBD Central Business District, or such
other nonresidential zoning districts as may be hereafter created. As
a condition of the approval of the Township for the conveyance of any
TDRs appurtenant to the 39.8526 acre portion of Bucks County Tax
Map Parcel No. 50-10-15, the transferor of the TDRs shall pay to the
Township as a transfer fee the sum of $3,000 per TDR payable at the
time of transfer of each TDR. The standards for the use of TDRs in the
above-referenced districts are those set forth in § 370-411G(6) of this
chapter.
A. Special setback requirements. The special setback provided for in

Planned Residential Development District
§ 370-901. Purpose.
The purpose of the PRD Residential/Planned Residential Development
District is to provide areas in which to accommodate projected residential

the availability and adequacy of public facilities and services, particularly
public water and sewer; to allow for variations in permissible densities of
development in accordance with the availability of public sewer and water
necessary to serve such development; to allow for a diversification mix
of residential types and densities; to encourage innovations in residential
development and efficient use of land that is served by public water and
sewer; to ensure flexibility in design and development; to encourage
environmentally sensitive development; and to respond to development
pressures and regional housing demand in accordance with population
and housing projections. The intent of this district is to accommodate a
significant portion of Warrington Township's share of regional projected
development and housing needs. The boundaries of the PRD District were
delineated based upon two principal considerations:
§ 370-902. Permitted uses.
The following uses may be permitted as a use by right:
A. The suitability of the area for residential development; and
B. The feasibility of providing public sewer and water from existing or

Art. I)]
[6] Prior to approval of any subdivision plan for lot averaging
pursuant to this chapter, applicant shall submit an
engineered sketch plan, which plan shall depict the area
proposed for dedication for public purposes, in addition to
the proposed layout of the building lots pursuant to the
design criteria set forth hereinabove. This sketch plan, if
approved as submitted or with certain revisions as
required by the Board of Supervisors, shall be
§ 370-903 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-903
1:766
incorporated as part of the conditional use approval such
that the subsequent submission of plans in accordance
with Chapter 305, Subdivision and Land Development, of
the Code of the Township of Warrington, shall be designed
in accordance with the layout as depicted thereon.
[7] The provisions of this chapter may be applied to an
application for subdivision of one parcel of land, or a
combined subdivision application for multiple parcels of
land shall be permitted unless the parcels of land are
owned or otherwise controlled by the same owner and/or
developer, and in the latter instance, applicant shall be

subdivision plan (or plans where multiple parcels are
involved) by the Board of Supervisors, applicant shall
deliver to Township, for recording, a deed of dedication for
the land which the Board of Supervisors, in its sole and
absolute discretion, has chosen to accept, for the parcel or
parcels then subject to the final subdivision plan approval,

to one; visually opaque fencing not greater than
six feet in height; and coniferous shrubbery.
[ii] Any combination of evergreen trees, coniferous
shrubs, or other natural vegetation or mounding
is allowable, provided an effective visual screen at
least 15 feet in height above the adjacent ground
elevation in the development is achieved within a
reasonable time. But, whenever only vegetation is
used, there shall be at least a double row of
evergreen trees, with the trees in one row offset
five feet from the trees in the other row, and the
rows at least five feet apart.
[b] Softening buffer. The primary component of a
softening buffer shall be a row of trees spaced more
§ 370-1605 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-1605

development occurs along natural features which function
as buffers including, but not limited to, mature vegetation,
significant grade changes or stream valleys, which are
likely to be permanently preserved, buffering may be
waived along that edge(s) upon approval of the Board of
Supervisors.

extent possible and practicable to those areas necessary for normal site
development activities (i.e., roads, lots, stormwater management
facilities, grading and the like).

expressed in caliper inches; dividing the cost difference by a
minimum size installed tree cost, and then multiplying by the
minimum tree size required.
Example: Assume a four-inch replacement tree is being provided.
Assume a two-inch installed tree costs $200 and a four-inch
installed tree costs $600. ($600 - $200) divided by $200 x two
inches equals four inches, plus the two-inch minimum size equals a

provided at a caliper larger than required by the ordinance shall
receive a credit in caliper inches equal to the difference between
the installed cost of the larger size and the installed cost of the
minimum tree size, expressed in caliper inches; dividing the cost
difference by the minimum size installed tree cost, and then
multiplying by the minimum tree size required.
Example: Assume a two-inch deciduous tree is being increased to a
four-inch deciduous tree. Assume the two-inch installed tree costs
$200 and the four-inch installed tree costs $600 ($600 - $200)
divided by $200 x 2 inches = 4-inch credit.

Supervisors determines they are not needed. These walkways
shall connect with walkways on abutting tracts or extend to the
property line so that they can be continued on the adjacent
tract.
(2) The walkways shall form a continuous coordinated system
throughout the development.
(3) Walkways shall be barrier-free and shall facilitate easy pedestrian
movement for all people, regardless of physical condition.
(4) A clearly marked crosswalk, at least 10 feet wide, is required
wherever a walkway crosses an internal street. The crosswalk may
be marked by either painted lines or with a paving material of a
different color.
(5) Seating and trash containers shall be located at appropriate

sides of all residential streets, secondary streets or
primary streets as defined by Chapter 305, Subdivision
and Land Development, § 305-304.
[4] All streets permitting on-street parking shall allow elevenfoot
travel lanes, eight-foot on-street parking lanes.
[5] On-street parking shall be prohibited on any through
primary road in the development which connects to an
arterial roadway.
(4) Whenever there is an alteration of a structure or a change or
extension of a use which increases the parking requirements
according to the standards of this chapter, the total additional
parking required for the alteration, change or extension shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements of that section.
(5) In order to prevent the establishment of a greater number of
parking spaces than is actually required to serve the needs of
nonresidential uses, the Board of Supervisors, after consulting with
the Planning Commission and Township Engineer, may permit a
§ 370-2905 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-2905
1:904
conditional reduction of parking space if the following conditions
are satisfied: [Amended 4-8-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-O-07;
2-23-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-O-05]
(a) The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land
development plan, must designate sufficient space to meet the
parking requirements of this chapter. The plan shall also
illustrate the layout for the total number of parking spaces.
(b) The conditional reduction shall provide for the establishment
of not less than 80% of the required number of parking spaces,
as specified in this chapter. This initial phase of the parking
provision shall be clearly indicated on the plan.
(c) The balance of the parking area conditionally reserved shall
not include areas for required buffer yards, setbacks or areas
which would otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to
the physical characteristics of the land or other requirements
of this chapter. This parking area which is reserved shall be
located and have characteristics so as to provide amenable
open space should it be determined the additional parking
spaces are not required. The developer shall provide a
landscaping plan for the reserved area with the land
development plan.
(d) The developer shall enter into a written agreement with the
Board of Supervisors that, after one year following the issuing
of the last occupancy permit, the additional parking spaces
shall be provided at the developer's or owner's expense should
it be determined that the required number of parking spaces
are necessary to satisfy the need of the particular land
development.
(e) At the time of the above-stated agreement, the developer or
owner shall post a performance bond or other securities to
cover the expense of a traffic study to be undertaken by a
registered traffic engineer of the Board of Supervisors'
choosing, who shall determine the advisability of providing the
full parking requirements. Said study shall be taken one year
after the issuance of the last occupancy permit pursuant to
Subsection D(5)(d) above. With recommendations of the
Township Engineer and the Planning Commission, the Board of
Supervisors shall determine if the additional spaces shall be
provided by the developer or if the area shall remain as open
space.
(f) Land which has been determined and designated by the Board
of Supervisors to remain as open space rather than as required
parking shall not be used to provide parking spaces for any
addition or expansion but shall remain as open space.

(2) All interior streets shall be landscaped with street trees that are
planted at an interval of 35 feet.
(3) A one-hundred-foot buffer is required along all property lines that
are adjacent to a residential zoning district. This buffer yard can be
reduced to 50 feet based on the final setbacks agreed during final
site development plan where floodplains, wetlands or natural
vegetation provide a sufficiently natural buffer and approval by the
Board of Supervisors. Parking loading/service areas and streets are
not permitted in the buffer yard. This buffer yard shall be
landscaped in accordance with the standards in Chapter 305,
Subdivision and Land Development, of the Code of the Township of
Warrington, including §§ 305-324 and 305-325.

submissions shall set clear standards for the aggregate project to
ensure that the development of the site achieves the healthy mix of
building uses and building types in a unified architectural manner. As
such, the development standards for buildable area, building coverage,
parking criteria and impervious coverage shall be related to the
aggregate project. Any future land development submission shall
comply with the approved preliminary and final land development plan.

[Amended 3-10-1998 by Ord. No. 98-7]
All applicants for a special exception for an accessory apartment shall have
the burden of going forward with evidence and the burden of persuasion for
all of the following requirements:
or any extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the
taxable value of the properties within the development and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance,
may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same
for a period of one year. Said maintenance by the Township shall
not constitute a taking of said common open space, nor vest in the
public rights to use the same. Before the expiration of said year,
the Township shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization
or to the residents of the development, to be held by the Board of

of the development shall show cause why such maintenance by
the Township shall not, at the option of the Township, continue
for a succeeding year. If the Board of Township Supervisors shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the Township
shall cease to maintain said common open space at the end of
the year. If the Township shall determine that such organization
is not ready and able to maintain such common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, at its discretion, continue
to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding
year; and, subject to similar hearing and determination, in each
year thereafter. The decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be
subject to appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same
time limitations, as is provided for zoning appeals.

D. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to
be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained
or used in violation of any ordinance enacted under this Act or prior to
the enabling laws, the Board of Supervisors, or with the approval of the
Board of Supervisors, an officer of the Township, or any aggrieved
owner or tenant of real property who shows that his property or person
will be substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to
other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping
or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct,
business or use constituting a violation. When any such action is
instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be served
upon the Township at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun
by serving a copy of the complaint on the Board of Supervisors of the
Township. No such action may be maintained until such notice has been
given.
E. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by Warrington Township, pay a judgment of not more than
$500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred
by Warrington Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, Warrington
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of
civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees collected for the violation of zoning
ordinances shall be paid over to Warrington Township.
A. Creation and membership. The Zoning Hearing Board created under
previous ordinances shall continue, said members having been
appointed by the Board of Supervisors. The Board shall consist of five
members, each of which shall serve a term of five years. Terms shall be
staggered so that one member's term shall expire on December 31 of
each year. The members of the Board shall be removable for cause, by
the Board of Supervisors, in accordance with the provisions in Act 247.
Vacancies shall be filled by appointment of the Board of Supervisors for
§ 370-3706 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-3707
1:989
the unexpired term of any member whose term become vacant. The
Board of Supervisors may also reappoint members of the Board whose
terms have expired.
B. General procedures. The Zoning Hearing Board shall be governed by
the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act
247 of 1968, amended, by Act 93 of 1972, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., as
may be amended or revised, and such other Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania laws as may be applicable. As used in this chapter, unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term "Board" shall refer to
such Zoning Hearing Board, and "Act 247" shall refer to the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, as cited
above.
C. Officers. The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers,
who shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves.
D. Meetings. Meetings shall be held at the call of the Board Chairman and
at such other times as the Board may determine.
E. Hearings. Hearings will be held and records will be kept in accordance
with Article IX, Act 247.190
F. Powers. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following powers:
(1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter or of any
ordinance adopted pursuant hereto.
(2) To hear and decide special exceptions authorized by this chapter. In
granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to those
expressed in the chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter. In any case where a special exception
is granted, construction must commence within six months;
otherwise, the special exception shall have deemed to have
expired. The procedures shall be the same as those specified under
this section. The following requirements also apply:
(a) Application shall be made in writing indicating the section of
this chapter under which an exception is sought. A reasonably
exact dimensional sketch shall be furnished showing
placement and use of the proposed buildings; details of
parking, loading and lighting; sidewalks and other pedestrian
areas.
(b) Further, a description of the uses proposed shall be included in
sufficient detail that the objectionable side effects, if any, can
be determined.

§ 370-3707 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-3707
1:990
(c) In granting special exceptions, the Zoning Hearing Board shall,
in addition to such other factors as it may deem relevant:
[1] Give full consideration to the size, scope, extent and
character of the exception desired and assure itself that
such request is consistent with the plan for future land use
in the Township and with the spirit, purpose and intent of
this chapter.
[2] Consider the suitability of the property for the use desired
and the extent to which the new expanded use is
susceptible of regulation or restriction by appropriate
conditions and safeguards.
[3] Consider the public interest in, or the need for the
proposed use or change, and determine that the proposal
will service the best interests of the Township, the
convenience of the community (where applicable), and the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare, but shall
not constitute a change of use to one not specifically
permitted by exception in that district.
[4] Consider, where pertinent, the effects of the proposed
change with respect to congestion on the roads or
highways, the most appropriate use of land, conserving
the value of buildings, safety from fire, panic and other
dangers, adequacy of light and air, the prevention of
overcrowding the land, congestion of population and the
adequacy of public and community services.
[5] Make certain that the proposed change is reasonable in
terms of the logical efficient and economic extension of
public services and facilities, such as public water, sewers,
police and fire protection, transportation and public
schools.
[6] Take into consideration the character and type of
development in the area surrounding the location for
which the request is made and determine that the
proposed change or modification, as permitted, will
constitute an appropriate use in the area and will not
substantially injure or detract from the use of surrounding
property or from the character of the neighborhood.
(3) To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to public interest,
where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, in
order that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed and
substantial justice done.
§ 370-3707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-3707
1:991
(4) Variances to the delineated one-hundred-year floodplain line and
elevations as specified in the Floodplain Management Ordinance
located in Chapter 181, Floodplain Management, of the Code of the
Township of Warrington.
(5) In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as believed proper. Notice
of such decision shall forthwith be given to all parties in interest.
G. Notice of public hearing. Upon receiving an appeal, the Board shall fix a
reasonable time and place for a public hearing thereon and shall give
the notice thereof:
(1) By advertising notice once each week for two successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Such notice
shall state the time and place of the hearing and the particular
nature of the matter to be considered at the hearing. The first
publication shall not be more than 30 days and the second
publication shall not be less than seven days from the date of the
hearing. [Amended 2-23-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-O-04]
(2) By mailing due notices at least six days prior to the date of the
hearing to the public in interest. Such parties shall be at least those
persons adjoining or across public roads from the property in
question.
(3) By posting said hearing notice conspicuously on the affected tract
of land.
H. Public hearing. The Board shall conduct a public hearing on such
appeal at which hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent or
attorney, and all of said parties so affected shall be given an opportunity
to be heard.
I. Decision of the Board. The Board shall decide the issue involved within
45 days after the hearing or, if said hearing is continued, within 45 days
after said continued hearing. If the Board does not make a decision
within 45 days after the hearing or continued hearing, it shall be
deemed that such Board has decided in favor of the Board of Township
Supervisors. Such amendment, supplement, change or repeal shall be
submitted to the Township Planning Commission for its
recommendations and shall be specially found by the Board of Township
Supervisors to be in accordance with the spirit and intent of the
formally adopted portions of the Comprehensive Plan before final action
shall be taken by the Board of Supervisors. [Amended 4-8-2014 by
Ord. No. 2014-O-07; 2-23-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-O-05]

2014-O-07; 2-23-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-O-05]
The Board of Township Supervisors may, from time to time, after public
notice and hearing as hereinafter prescribed, amend, supplement, change
or repeal this chapter, including the Zoning Map. Any amendment,
supplement, change or repeal may be initiated by the Township Planning
Commission, the Board of Supervisors or by a petition to the Township
Secretary and shall thereafter be refiled as part of the permanent records
of the Township.
(1) If the variance is granted or the issuance of a permit is approved, or
other action by the appellant is authorized, the necessary permit
shall be secured and the authorized action begun within six months
after the date when the variance is finally granted or the issuance
of the permit is finally approved, or the other action by the
appellant is authorized; the building or alteration, as the case may
be, shall be completed within 12 months of said date. For good
cause, the Board may, upon application in writing stating the
reasons therefor, extend it for an additional six months.
(2) Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within said six-month-period, or having obtained the
permit, should he fail to commence work thereunder within such
six-month-period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the
appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his
appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances and permits
granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the
Board.
(3) Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or
alteration within said six-month-period, but should he fail to
complete such construction or alteration within said twelve-monthperiod,
the Board may rescind or revoke the granted variance, or
the issuance of the permit, or permits, or other action authorized to
the appellant or applicant. If the Board finds that a good cause
appears for the failure to complete within such twelve-monthperiod,
and if the Board further finds that conditions have so
altered or changed in the interval since the granting of the
variance, permit or action, that revocation or rescission of the
action is justified.
A. Amendments initiated by the Township Planning Commission. When an
amendment, supplement, change or repeal is initiated by the Township
Planning Commission, the proposal shall be presented to the Board of
Township Supervisors, which shall then proceed in the same manner as
with a petition to the Board of Township Supervisors which has already
been reviewed by the Township Planning Commission.
B. Amendment initiated by the Board of Township Supervisors. When an
amendment, supplement, change or repeal is initiated by the Board of
§ 370-3707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-3708
1:993
Township Supervisors, it shall submit the proposal to the Township
Planning Commission for review and recommendations.
C. Amendments by citizens' petition. Whenever the owners of 75% or more
of the adjacent properties, including those with opposite street frontage
in any area where a change of zoning regulations is sought, shall
present to the Board of Supervisors a petition duly signed and
acknowledged, requesting an amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal of regulations prescribed for or the Zoning Map
including such area, it shall be the duty of the Board of Supervisors to
hold a public hearing thereon and cause written notice to be given to
each property owner having frontage on the subject area not less than
14 days in advance of said public meeting and notices to be given in a
manner prescribed in Subsection G of this section. For purposes of this
section, the area wherein a change in zoning is sought shall be not less
than five acres or 1,000 feet of lineal frontage, whichever is less.
D. Procedure for petition. The petition for amendment, supplement,
change or repeal shall contain as fully as possible all the information
requested by the Zoning Officer and shall be signed by at least one
record owner of the property in question, whose signature shall be
notarized attesting to the truth and correctness of all the facts and
information presented in the petition. A fee established by the Board of
Township Supervisors shall be paid upon the filing of such petition for
change and for the purpose of defraying the costs of the proceedings
prescribed herein.
E. Referral to Township Planning Commission. After receipt of the petition
by the Board of Township Supervisors, said petition shall be presented
to the Township Planning Commission for review and recommendations
at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. A report of said review,
together with any recommendations, shall be given to the Board of
Township Supervisors in writing within 30 days from the date of

ARTICLE XXXVIII
Transportation Impact Study
[Added 9-20-1988 by Ord. No. 88-17]
§ 370-3801. Purpose.
A transportation impact study shall be required for all major subdivisions
and land developments or zoning changes, special exceptions or conditional
uses as defined in § 370-3803. This study will enable Warrington Township
to assess the impact of a proposed development, zoning change, special
exception or conditional use on the transportation system, both highways
and public transportation in Warrington Township. Its purpose is to insure
that proposed developments or zoning changes do not adversely affect the
transportation network and to identify any traffic problems that are created
in the existing highway network as a result of the development, zoning
changes, special exception or conditional use. The study's purpose is also
to delineate solutions to potential problems and to present improvements
to be incorporated into the proposed development or to the highway and/
or public transportation system within the study area as designated in
§ 370-3804. The study shall assist in the protection of air quality, the
conservation of energy and the encouragement of public transportation use.
§ 370-3802. Conduct of the traffic impact study.
The traffic impact study shall be prepared by an experienced traffic
engineer and/or transportation planner with previous traffic study
experience. The procedures and standards for the traffic impact study are
set forth in § 370-3805 of this article.
§ 370-3803. Applicability.
A. A transportation impact study shall be submitted for all change of
zoning requests, special exceptions and conditional uses and as part of
the preliminary plan application for all subdivisions and/or land
developments for all commercial or industrial applications and for
residential applications of 10 or more dwelling units.
B. The application for change of zoning requests and preliminary
subdivision and/or land development plans which meet the aforesaid
criteria shall not be considered complete until the transportation
impact study is submitted to the Township Manager in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
C. The Warrington Planning Commission, at its discretion, may require
any subdivision, land development, zoning change, special exception, or
conditional use application to be accompanied by a traffic impact study,
provided that the Warrington Township Manager notifies the applicant
immediately after the first meeting of the Planning Commission to
consider the proposal. Such notification shall specify the reason for the
requirement, citing the proposal's particular location or existing
§ 370-3801 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-3803
1:997
§ 370-3804. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CAPACITY ANALYSIS  Intersection approach capacity is the maximum
rate of vehicular flow that can pass through an intersection under roadway,
traffic and signalization conditions. The analysis compares actual or
projected traffic volume to the intersection capacity and in a volume/
capacity (v/c) ratio.
LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS)  As described in the 1985 Highway Capacity
Manual Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, is a qualitative
measure of the operational conditions within the traffic stream and their
perceptions by motorists. Levels of service are defined in terms of delay for
signalized intersections and reserve capacity for unsignalized intersections.
Six levels of service (A through F) are defined for each type of facility with
LOS "A" representing least congested operating conditions and LOS "F"
representing a breakdown in the operating conditions.
MAJOR INTERSECTION  Any intersection, either signalized or
unsignalized, where traffic generated by the proposal will have a significant
impact on the operation of the intersection. The transportation engineer
shall seek guidance from the Warrington Township Engineer prior to the
initiation of the traffic impact study to ensure agreement on the location of
major intersections.[Amended 4-8-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-O-07]
OFF-SITE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS  Other transportation
related improvements which are generally not contiguous with the property
being developed and not required as an on-site improvement but found to
be necessary as a result of the proposed development.
ON-SITE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT  All improvements on or
adjacent to the development site in the public right-of-way required to
be constructed by the developer pursuant to any ordinance, resolution
or requirement of Warrington Township and/or directly related to the
transportation needs of the subdivision and/or land development.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  Transportation services for the general
public provided by a common carrier of passengers, generally but not
necessarily on a regular-route basis, by the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority or a private operator offering service to the public.
STUDY AREA  This area will extend along the adjacent roadways in both
directions from all access points to at least the first major intersection along
these roadways but no further than two miles. The transportation engineer
shall seek guidance from the Warrington Township Engineer prior to the
initiation of the traffic impact study to ensure agreement on the study area
boundaries.[Amended 4-8-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-O-07]
problems or type of use (e.g., generation of heavy truck traffic).

No. 2016-O-05]
§ 370-3803 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-3804
1:998
TRIP GENERATION RATES  The total count of trips to and from a study
site per unit of land use, as measured by parameters like dwelling units,
acres, etc. The Trip Generation Report, Third Edition, or as amended by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers, shall be referenced to determine
specific rates.
WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLATION  A series of tests
which detail the minimum traffic or pedestrian volumes or other criteria
necessary for the installation of a traffic signal. These warrants are
contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways, United States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, 1978, as amended.
§ 370-3805. General requirements and standards.
A transportation impact study shall contain the following information:
A. General site description. The site description shall include the size,
location, proposed land uses, construction staging and completion date
of the proposed land development. If the development is residential,
types of dwelling units shall also be included. The general site
description shall also include probable socioeconomic characteristics of
potential site users to the extent that they may affect the transportation
needs of the site (i.e., number of senior citizens). A brief description of
other major existing and proposed land development within the study
area shall be provided.
B. Transportation facilities description.
(1) The description shall contain a full documentation of the proposed
internal and existing external transportation system. This
description shall include proposed internal vehicular, bicycle and
pedestrian circulation, all proposed ingress and egress locations,
all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way, parking conditions,
traffic channelizations and any traffic signals or other intersection
control devices at all intersections within the site. The site design
shall be shown to maximize potential public transportation usage to
and from the development, by providing adequate turning radii at
all access points to allow a bus to enter the development and
designating bus shelter and sign locations where appropriate.
(2) The report shall describe the entire external roadway system
within the study area. Major intersections in the study area shall be
identified and illustrated. All existing and proposed public
transportation services and facilities within a one-mile radius of the
site shall also be documented. Regional rail stations within three
miles shall be noted. All future highway improvements, including
proposed construction and traffic signalization, shall be noted. This
information shall be obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation's Twelve-Year Highway and Bridge Program and
Warrington Township's Public Works Department. Any proposed
§ 370-3804 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-3805
1:999
roadway improvements due to proposed surrounding developments
shall be recorded.
C. Existing traffic conditions.
(1) Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented for
all roadways and intersections in the study area and shall include
current average daily traffic volumes, peak highway hour(s) traffic,
and peak development generated hour(s) traffic. Manual traffic
counts at major intersections in the study area shall be conducted,
encompassing the peak highway and development generated
hour(s), and documentation shall be included in a technical
appendix to the report. Volume/capacity (v/c) and delay analysis
based upon existing volumes shall be performed during the peak
highway hour(s) and the peak development generated hour(s) for
all roadways and major intersections in the study area. Volume/
capacity ratios and delay levels of service shall be determined for
each location according to the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual.
(2) This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway
system to serve the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or
intersections experiencing levels of service D, E or F or v/c ratios
greater than or equal to 1.0 shall be noted as congested locations.
(a) Existing traffic conditions (when a municipality-wide
transportation study has been conducted). The Warrington
Township Area Transportation Study, as adopted, shall be
considered the baseline for determining existing conditions.
Updated average daily traffic volumes and manual turning
movement counts shall be provided for the peak highway
hour(s) traffic and peak development generated hour(s) traffic.
All data shall be included in the technical appendix to the
report. Volume/capacity (v/c) and delay analyses, based on the
updated traffic volumes, shall be performed for the peak
highway hour(s) and the peak development generated hour(s)
for all roadways and intersections in the study area. V/c ratios
and delay levels of service (LOS) shall be determined for each
location.
(3) All changes from the baseline conditions shall be noted.
D. Transportation impact study.
(1) Estimation of vehicular trips to result from the proposal shall be
completed for the average daily peak highway hour(s) and peak
development generated hour(s). Vehicular trip generation rates to
be used for this calculation shall be obtained from the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation Report, Third Edition,
or as amended. For land uses not listed in the Institute's report, the
transportation engineer shall seek guidance from the Township
Engineer. [Amended 4-8-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-O-07]
§ 370-3805 WARRINGTON CODE § 370-3805
1:1000
(2) All turning movements shall be calculated. These generated
volumes shall be distributed to the study area and assigned to the
existing roadways and intersections throughout the study area.
Documentation of all assumptions used in the distribution and
assignment phases shall be provided. Traffic volumes shall be
assigned to individual access points. Pedestrian volumes shall also
be calculated, if applicable. If school crossings are to be used,
pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any
characteristics of the site that will cause particular trip generation
or distribution problems shall be noted.
E. Analysis of transportation impact.
(1) The total future traffic shall be calculated and shall consist of the
existing traffic volume expanded to the project completion year
using an annual background growth factor plus the development
generated traffic and the traffic generated by other proposed
developments in the study area. The annual background growth
factor shall be determined using projected rates of population and
employment growth as determined by the Bucks County Planning
Commission and the average annual traffic growth of the area's
roadways as determined from the Delaware Valley Regional
Planning Commission's "Highway Network Coverage Traffic
Counts" and current twenty-four-hour traffic counts.
(2) Volume/capacity and delay analyses shall be conducted using the
total future demand and the future roadway capacity. If staging of
the proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each
stage of completion shall be made.
(3) The analyses shall be performed for the peak highway hour(s) and
peak development generated hour(s) for all roadways and major
intersections and proposed access points of the development. It is
usually at these locations that capacity is most restricted.
(4) All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined as to
the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This evaluation shall
compare the project traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants
for traffic signal installation.
F. Conclusions and recommended improvements.
(1) Levels of service (LOS) and volume/capacity (v/c) ratios shall be
listed for all roadways and intersections. All roadways and/or
intersections showing levels of service D, E or F or v/c ratios equal
to or greater than 1.0 shall be considered deficient. Also, the
proportion of site-generated traffic to total future traffic shall be
identified at each intersection approach that is considered
deficient. Specific recommendations for the elimination of all
deficiencies shall be listed and shall include, but not be limited to,
the following elements: internal circulation design, site access
location and design, external roadway intersection design and
