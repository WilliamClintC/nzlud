the discretion of the court against the sexually oriented business. Each day
a sexually oriented business so operates is a separate offense or violation.

It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses to
promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the
township and to establish reasonably and uniform regulations to prevent

way condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials or harmful
materials to minors.

equivalent official or designee shall determine if the action taken or
to be taken will substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms.
If he determines that the action will substantially reduce the
likelihood of false alarms, he shall notify the alarm user, in writing,
that his permit will not be revoked at this time and that if three
more false alarms occur within the permit year, the user's permit
may be revoked.
(3) If no report is submitted, or if the Chief of Police or equivalent
official or designee determines that the action taken or to be taken
will not substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms, the
Chief of Police or equivalent official or designee shall give notice by
first class postage prepaid, certified mail, to the user that the

action which substantially reduces the likelihood of false alarms, it
shall issue an order revoking the user's permit.
(6) An alarm user shall immediately discontinue use of this alarm
system upon being notified by first class postage prepaid, certified
mail, of the revocation of his permit.
(7) An alarm user whose permit has been revoked may apply for a
probationary user's permit. The Manager shall not be required to
issue a probationary user's permit, unless he is satisfied that the
user's system has been properly serviced and its deficiencies
corrected. The Manager may impose reasonable restrictions and
conditions upon the user, before issuing a probationary user's
permit, which restrictions and conditions shall be written on the
permit. A probationary user's permit shall be issued for only a oneyear
period. If the alarm user does not have three or more false
alarms during that period, they may apply for a permanent permit
under the provisions of § 61-8.
A. For the purpose of defraying the costs to the Police Department and
Fire Companies of responding to false alarms, the owner, lessee or user
of any alarm system, person using the service of an intermediary, user
of audible alarms and user of any other kind of alarm systems or any
other kind of direct or indirect connections with the Police, Fire or EMS
Communications Centers, except a person using the two-way live voice
communication by telephone, shall, as a condition to installation and
continued operation of such equipment or service, execute a consent in

contractor is insured for an amount of not less than the sum of $100,000
against any injury or damage to persons or property arising directly or
indirectly from the performance of the contractor in making the excavation
or fill for which such permit is issued.
§ 98-13. Revocation or suspension of permit.
Any permit granted under this chapter may be revoked by the Code Official
for any reason for which the issuance of a permit might be lawfully denied
or for the failure of the contractor to comply with any of the terms or
conditions of the permit. Revocation shall be made only after a hearing
before the Code Official after five days' written notice to the applicants,
given by personal service or deposited in the United States mail, addressed
to the applicants at the addresses given in the application. The action of the
Code Official may be appealed to the Board of Commissioners as heretofore.

endangered the Code Official may suspend any permit. Such revocation
or suspension shall be in addition to any other penalties provided in this
chapter.

materials from any such excavation shall be immediately removed in a
manner and to an extent satisfactory to the Code Official at the expense
of the applicant.

shall be made; provided, however, that the conditions and responsibilities
in such permit shall remain binding upon the person or firm to whom such
permit was issued, and all legal and equitable remedies shall be available
against such person or firm for any breach thereof. When the amount of
material excavated or filled equals the number of cubic yards authorized by
the permit, no further excavation or fill shall be made until a supplemental
permit has been issued. An excavation or fill shall set forth the same
information required in the original application correcting, however, the
quantity of excavation or fill and paying the proper fee therefor.

structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such estimate
is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the
insured the amount of the funds transferred to the township in
excess of that required to pay the municipal expenses,
provided that the township has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case
the township will complete the work.

velocities they impose additional loads on the structure. These loads consist
of frontal impact by the mass of moving water against the projected width
of the obstruction represented by the structure, drag effect along the sides
of the structure and eddies or negative pressures on the downstream side.
HYDROSTATIC LOADS  These loads or pressures at any point of
floodwater contact with the structure are equal in all directions and always
act perpendicular to the surface on which they are applied. Pressures
increase lineally with depth of head water above the point under
consideration. The summation of pressures over the surface under
consideration represents the load acting on that surface. For structural
analysis purposes, hydrostatic loads are defined to act vertically downward
on structural elements such as roofs, decks and similar overhead members
having a depth of water above them, vertically upward or uplift when they
act at the underside of generally horizontal members such as slabs and
footings and the net effect is upward and laterally when they act in a
horizontal direction on walls, piers and similar vertical structural elements.
It is assumed that hydrostatic conditions prevail for still water and water
moving with a velocity of less than five feet per second.
IMPACT LOADS  These loads are induced on the structure by solid objects
and masses carried by or floating on the moving water surface. These loads
are the most difficult to predict and define with any degree of accuracy,
yet reasonable allowances must be made for these loads in the design and
potential debris problems at the site and to the degree of exposure of the
structure in relationship to its general setting.
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest fully enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished, flood-resistant partially enclosed area,
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and incidental storage,
in an area other than a basement area is not considered the lowest floor of
a building, provided that such space is not designed and built so that the
structure is in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements
of this chapter.

100:151
MANUFACTURED (MOBILE) HOME  A transportable, single-family
dwelling intended for permanent occupancy, office or place of assembly,
contained in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis, which
arrives at a site complete and ready for occupancy except for minor and
incidental unpacking and assembly operations and constructed so that it
may be used with or without a permanent foundation. For Federal
Emergency Management (FEMA) floodplain management purposes, this
term includes recreational vehicles, travel trailers and other similar
vehicles located on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days.
MANUFACTURED (MOBILE) HOME PARK  A parcel of land under single
ownership which has been planned and improved for the placement of two
or more mobile homes for nontransient use.
MUDSLIDE  A condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid
mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush
cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on or under the ground
preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.
MUDSLIDE AREA HAVING SPECIAL MUDSLIDE HAZARDS  A mudslide
area with a high potential for mudslides.
MUDSLIDE-PRONE AREA OR MUDSLIDE AREA  An area with land
surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology
and climate indicate a potential for mudslide.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Any structure for which construction commenced
on or after September 19, 1977, and includes any subsequent improvements
thereto.
OBSTRUCTION  Any wall, dam, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation, channel rectification, culvert, building,
fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across or
projecting into any channel, watercourse or designated floodplain districts,
which may impede, retard or change the direction of the flow of water which
might carry the same downstream to the damage of life or property.
ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD  The highest level of flooding that, on the
average, is likely to occur once every 100 years within the Township (i.e.,
that has a one-percent chance of occurring each year), although the flood
may occur in any year. It shall also mean "base flood" or "area of special
flood hazard" or "regulatory flood."
REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION  The one-hundred-year-flood elevation
based upon information contained in the Flood Insurance Study plus a
freeboard safety factor of 1 1/2 feet. Unless other data exists, within the
General Floodplain Conservation District, the height of a one-hundred-year
flood shall be established as a point on the boundaries of the General
Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest to the construction site in
question.
STORY  That portion of a building included between the surface of any
floor and the surface of the floor next above it; if there is no floor above it,
then the space between any floor and the ceiling immediately above it.

assessment and collection of a civil penalty contained in § 117-8B of this
article.
A. Criminal penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this article
or any order of the Township issued pursuant to this article commits a
summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine
of not less than $100 nor more than $2,500 for each separate offense

issued pursuant to this article, the Township may assess a civil
penalty for the violation. The penalty may be assessed whether or
not the violation was willful. The civil penalty so assessed shall not
exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. In determining the
amount of the penalty, the Township shall consider the willfulness
of the violation; damage to air, soil, water, or other natural
resources of the Township or their uses; financial benefit to the
person in consequence of the violation; deterrence of future
violations; cost to the Township; the size of the source or facility;
the compliance history of the source; the severity and duration of
the violation; degree of cooperation in resolving the violation; the
speed with which compliance is ultimately achieved; whether the
violation was voluntarily reported; other factors unique to the
owners or operators of the source or facility; and other relevant
factors.
§ 117-7 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 117-8
100:166
(2) When the Township proposes to assess a civil penalty, it shall
inform the person of the proposed amount of the penalty. The
person charged with the penalty shall then have 30 days to pay the
proposed penalty in full; or if the person wishes to contest the
amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation to the extent not
already established, the person shall forward the proposed amount
of the penalty to the Township within the thirty-day period for
placement in an escrow account with the State Treasurer or any
commonwealth bank, or post an appeal bond to the Township
within 30 days in the amount of the proposed penalty, provided that
such bond is executed by a surety licensed to do business in the
commonwealth and is satisfactory to the Township. If, through
administrative or final judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is
determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the
penalty shall be reduced, the Township shall, within 30 days, remit
the appropriate amount to the person with any interest
accumulated by the escrow deposit. Failure to forward the money
or the appeal bond at the time of the appeal shall result in a waiver
of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the civil
penalty unless the appellant alleges financial inability to prepay the
penalty or to post the appeal bond. The Township shall conduct a
hearing to consider the appellant's alleged inability to pay within
30 days of the date of the appeal. The Township may waive the
requirement to prepay the civil penalty or to post an appeal bond if
the appellant demonstrates and the Township finds that the
appellant is financially unable to pay. The Township shall issue an
order within 30 days of the date of the hearing to consider the
appellant's alleged inability to pay. The amount assessed after
administrative hearing or after waiver of administrative hearing
shall be payable to the Township and shall be collectible in any
manner provided by law for the collection of debts, including the
collection of interest on the penalty amount computed in
accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (Public Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) from the date of
assessment of the penalty. If any person liable to pay any such
penalty neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the
amount, together with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall
constitute a debt of such person, as may be appropriate, to the
Township. The debt shall constitute a lien on all property owned by
said person when a notice of lien incorporating a description of the
property of the person subject to the action is duly filed with the
prothonotary of the court of common pleas where the property is
located. The prothonotary shall promptly enter upon the civil
judgment or order docket, at no cost to the Township, the name and
address of the person, as may be appropriate, and the amount of
the lien as set forth in the notice of lien. Upon entry by the
prothonotary, the lien shall attach to the revenues and all real and
personal property of the person, whether or not the person is
solvent. The notice of lien, filed pursuant to this section, which

of any of the provisions of this article or to fail to comply with any order
or other requirement of the Township; or to cause a public nuisance; or to
hinder, obstruct, prevent, or interfere with the Township or its personnel
in their performance of any duty hereunder, including denying the Code
Enforcement Official access to the source or facility.
§ 117-10. Public nuisances.
A violation of this article or of any order issued by the Township under
this article shall constitute a public nuisance. The Township shall have the
authority to order any person causing a public nuisance to abate the public
nuisance. In addition, when abating a public nuisance, the Township may
recover the expenses of abatement following the process for assessment
and collection of a civil penalty contained in § 117-8B. Whenever the
nuisance is maintained or continued contrary to this article or any order
issued pursuant to this article, the nuisance may be abatable in the manner
provided by this article. Any person who causes the public nuisance shall be
liable for the cost of abatement.
§ 117-11. Effect on other provisions.

ordinances in force immediately prior to the enactment of this article, are
intended as a continuation of such ordinances and not as new enactments.
The provisions of this article shall not affect any such suit or prosecution
pending or to be instituted to enforce any right or penalty or to punish any
offense under the authority of any ordinance repealed by this article.

over all subsequent claims or liens which are filed against the
person, but it shall not affect any valid lien, right, or interest in
the property filed in accordance with established procedure prior

water lines, no excavation or pipe-laying shall be done at those
crossings without the presence of an authorized representative of
the Authority having jurisdiction, and no such excavation shall be
done without the prior written approval of the owner or lessee of
such line.
(2) Sewer lines and other work shall be protected at all times against

into the trench and shall be kept clean during the laying operation
by means of plugs or other devices. [Amended 11-9-1998 by Ord.
No. 98-10]
(3) When laying PVC pipe, the spigot shall be cleaned and lubricated,
with care being taken not to allow the spigot end of the pipe to
touch the bedding material after lubrication. Insert the spigot end
of the pipe into the bell, making contact with the rubber ring. While
keeping the pipe in proper alignment, brace the bell as the spigot of
the pipe is pushed into the bell. Assembly may either be made by
hand or with a wooden block. Stabbing of the pipe shall not be
allowed. Care must be taken to ensure that the pipe is not
overassembled, beyond the reference mark, because this will cause
the spigot to squeeze down in the neck of the bell, creating a
reduced internal diameter of the spigot end.
(4) Walking or working on the complete pipeline, except as necessary
in tamping or backfilling, shall not be permitted until the trench
has been backfilled to a height of at least one foot over the top of
the pipe.
C. Protection of the pipe. Once the sewer pipe has been laid to a true
grade and alignment, it should be protected from displacement or
breakage until the trench is backfilled. Protection may be provided by
placement of initial backfill material. The upper end of the pipe shall be
plugged at the end of the work day or if pipelaying is to be stopped for
several hours.
D. Drop connections to manholes. Where change in grade of the sewer line
requires the use of a drop manhole, the pipe and fittings used to make
those drop connections shall be of the same type pipe and fittings as
used to construct the sewer line. All drop connections to manholes shall
be of the outside drop type as shown in the sewer detail drawings.79
E. Branches.
(1) Wye branches shall be of the same pipe material as the pipe used to
construct the main sewer to which it is connected. In general,
connections to sewer mains shall be made with commercially
manufactured branches and 1/8 bend.

§ 175-42 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 175-43
169:244
§ 175-43. National categorical pretreatment standards.
Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at
40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. Environmental Protection
Agency regulations at 40 CFR 403.13 authorize a CIU to obtain a variance
from a categorical pretreatment standard if the CIU can prove, pursuant to
the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors
relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
The Township and Authority may recognize revised standards if the user
has obtained an FDF variance from EPA on the basis of 40 CFR 403.13 and
consider using revised EPA FDF variance standards.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with § 175-43E and [40 CFR 403.6(c)].
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Authority
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users [40 CFR 403.6(c)(2)].
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(e).
D. A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following subsections of this section
(40 CFR 403.15).
(1) Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in
accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain
credit for intake pollutants must make application to the Authority.
Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be
calculated on a net basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for
pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of Subsection
D(2) of this section are met.
(2) Criteria.
(a) Either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR, Subchapter N, specifically provide that
they shall be applied on a net basis or the industrial user
demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to
meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if
properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
§ 175-43 (RESERVED) § 175-43
169:245
(b) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and
grease shall not be granted unless the industrial user
demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in
the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents
of the generic measure in the intake water or unless
appropriate additional limits are placed on process water
pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
(c) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a
maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional
monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for
credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
(d) Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into
which the POTW discharges. The Authority may waive this
requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will
result.
E. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the
Authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. Mass-based limit
requests will not be approved by the Authority in place of categorical
concentration-based limits for pollutants such as pH, temperature,
radiation or any other pollutants for which mass limits are not
appropriate. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass
limits is within the discretion of the Authority. The Authority may
establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the
conditions set forth in § 175-43E(1)(a) through (e) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a
substitute for treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data
from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as
the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the
actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average
production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
§ 175-43 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 175-43
169:246
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined
in § 175-43E(1)(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised
production rate, the Authority will reassess the equivalent
mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those implemented
pursuant to § 175-43E(1)(a) of this section so long as it
discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Authority:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of
the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum
and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion
factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial
user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a
result of the implementation of water conservation methods
and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used
in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment
pursuant to § 175-47. The industrial user must also be in
§ 175-43 (RESERVED) § 175-43
169:247
§ 175-44. State pretreatment standards.
Users must comply with all applicable Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes,
as amended.
§ 175-45. Local limits.
compliance with § 175-103, regarding the prohibition of
bypass.
F. The Authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. When converting such limits to
concentration limits, the Authority will use the concentrations listed in
the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 and
document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as
prohibited by § 175-47 of this article. In addition, the Authority will
document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from
concentrations to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information
publicly available [40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)].
G. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this § 175-43 in lieu of the
promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived [40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)].
H. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average,
limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average
and the maximum equivalent limitation [40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)].
I. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Authority within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the Authority of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on
the original estimate of the long-term average production rate [40 CFR
403.6(c)(9)].
A. The Authority is required and authorized to establish local limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
B. Pollutant limits.
(1) The following pollutant limits are established to protect against
pass-through and interference. No person shall discharge
§ 175-43 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 175-45
169:248
§ 175-46. Authority's right of revision.
The Authority reserves the right to establish, by resolution or in individual
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements
on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this article.
§ 175-47. Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
wastewater containing in excess of the following monthly average
and daily maximum limits.

requirement. The Authority may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements
or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
§ 175-48. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in § 175-42 of this article
within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state or the Authority,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall
be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Authority for review before such facilities are constructed. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce
a discharge acceptable to the Authority under the provisions of this article.
§ 175-49. Additional pretreatment measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Township or Authority may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as
may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's
compliance with the requirements of this article.
B. The Township or Authority may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on his or her property and at his or her
expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be
issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Township and Authority, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil
or sand except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity to
accommodate the peak flow and loading expected to occur, have a
minimum size of 250 gallons, be located outside as to be readily
accessible for inspection and cleaning and be approved by the
Authority.

The Township or Authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The Township or Authority may require any user to
develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the
Township or Authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
§ 175-51. Hauled wastewater.
The Authority will not receive hauled septic tank waste or hauled industrial
waste.
§ 175-52. Wastewater analysis.
When requested by the Township or Authority, a user must submit

discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials,
loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker
training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
A. No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge
permit from the Authority, except that a significant industrial user that
has filed a timely application pursuant to § 175-54 of this article may
continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.
B. The Authority may require other users to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article.
C. Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects

subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Township and Authority a report containing the information described
in § 175-56A(6) and (7) and 175-67(B)(2) of this article. For users subject
to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with
the procedures in § 175-43 [40 CFR 403.6(c)], this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of
operation, this report shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 175-80A of this article. All sampling will be
done in conformance with § 175-77.
§ 175-70. Periodic compliance reports.
All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports.
A. Except as specified in § 175-70C, all significant industrial users must, at
a frequency determined by the Township or Authority, submit no less
than twice per year and no later than 45 days from the last day of June
and December reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP)
or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Authority or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
B. The Authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water
and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user [40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)].
(1) This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(a) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged
from the facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not
regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise
includes no process wastewater.
(b) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit,
but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a
new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted
§ 175-69 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 175-70
169:262
for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
See § 175-56A(8).
(c) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of
the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment
present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater
from all processes.
(d) The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with § 175-41E and include the certification
statement in § 175-80A [40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)].
(e) Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPAapproved
method from 40 CFR 136 with the lowest minimum
detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(f) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Authority must be
included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the
user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the
Authority for three years after expiration of the waiver.
(g) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user's permit by the Authority, the industrial user must certify
on each report with the statement in § 175-80C below that
there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream
due to activities of the industrial user.
(h) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the
monitoring requirements of § 175-70A, or other more frequent
monitoring requirements imposed by the Authority, and notify
the Authority.
(i) This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment
standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical
pretreatment standard.
(2) Any Categorical user that is authorized to reduce its monitoring to
once per year is required to immediately notify the Authority if it no
longer meets the criteria for reduced monitoring [40 CFR
403.12(e)(3)(iv)].
C. Reduced reporting.
(1) The Authority may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance
reports for Categorical users subject to categorical standards as
may be permitted by § 175-70A [40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)] to a
§ 175-70 (RESERVED) § 175-70
169:263
§ 175-71. Reports of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the Township and Authority of any significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
EPA, where the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow
does not exceed any of the following:
(a) A value equal to 62,500 gallons per day, 0.01% of the POTW's
design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000
gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the
industrial user discharges in batches; and
(b) A value equal to 108.46 pounds per day, 0.01% of the design
dry-weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and
(c) A value equal to 0.01% of the maximum allowable headworks
loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local
limits were developed in accordance with § 175-45 of this
article.
(2) Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in
the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in
§ 175-84 of this article. In addition, reduced reporting is not
available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production
levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the
opinion of the Authority decreasing the reporting requirement for
this industrial user, would result in data that are not representative
of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
D. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 175-80A of this article.
E. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
F. If a user subject to the reporting requirements in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Authority, using the procedures
prescribed in § 175-77 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.

If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
A. The Township or Authority may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 175-56 of this article.
B. The Authority may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
under § 175-65 of this article or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under § 175-62 of this article in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that
might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Authority of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the Authority, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any
other damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve
the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this article.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in Subsection A above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
D. Significant industrial users are required to notify the Authority
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a
slug discharge.
§ 175-71 (RESERVED) § 175-74
169:265
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the Authority within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the
Authority performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or
if the Authority performs sampling at the user's facility between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or
the Authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the Authority has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
§ 175-75. Discharge of hazardous waste prohibited.
§ 175-76. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136,
and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Township or Authority or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 175-77. Sample collection.
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be obtained
through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, which is representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period.
A. The discharge into the POTW of any substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261 is
prohibited.
B. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Township and Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities, and stop the
discharge of such substance on the effective date of such regulations.
C. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place stop the hazardous wastes
generated from being discharged.
D. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 175-78. Date of receipt of reports.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 175-79. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and
documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall
A. Except as indicated in Subsections B and C below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Authority. Where timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the
reasons documented for using the alternative sampling monitoring.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to
the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Township or Authority, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
compliance reports required in §§ 175-67 and 175-69 [40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the Township or Authority
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by § 175-70
[40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)], the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and
Requirements.

§ 175-81. Right of entry: inspection and sampling.
The Township and Authority shall have the right to enter the premises of any
user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this article and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the Township and Authority ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties.
§ 175-82. Search warrants.
If the Township or Authority has been refused access to a building, structure
or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the Authority designed to verify compliance with this article
or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the Township or Authority
may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Court of Common Pleas of
Cumberland or York County or other appropriate forum and may request
EPA enforcement assistance.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Township and Authority
shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.
B. The Township or Authority shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The Township or Authority may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum
frequency specified by the Township or Authority based on site
conditions to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Township or Authority
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Township or Authority access to
the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.

Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs, and from the Township's or Authority's inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Township or Authority, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report
that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall
not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the
public without restriction.
§ 175-84. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The Township or Authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any
other industrial user that violates Subsections C, D or H of this section) and
shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any

§ 175-85. Notice of violation.
When the Township or Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Township or Authority may serve upon that user a
written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
by the user to the Township or Authority. Submission of such a plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the Township or Authority to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
§ 175-86. Consent orders.
The Township or Authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 175-88
and 175-89 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Authority's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the Authority determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
§ 175-84 (RESERVED) § 175-87

§ 175-87. Show cause hearing.
The Township or Authority may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, to appear before the Township or Authority and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and
a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user as defined in § 175-41 and required by § 175-58.
A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
§ 175-88. Compliance orders.
When the Township or Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Township or Authority may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within
the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional selfmonitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount
of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
§ 175-89. Cease and desist orders.
When the Township or Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a

cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
A. When the Township or Authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Township or Authority may
fine such user in an amount not to exceed the maximum fine allowed
under state law. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
B. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Township or Authority to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of
the fine amount, within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Township or Authority may convene a hearing on
the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment
shall be returned to the user. The Township or Authority may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices
and orders, to the fine.
C. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. The Township or Authority may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Township or Authority may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Township or Authority may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or
endangerment to any individuals. The Township or Authority may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township or Authority that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in § 175-92 of this article are initiated against the user.

§ 175-92. Termination of discharge.
§ 175-93. Injunctive relief.
When the Township or Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Township or Authority may petition the Court of Common
Pleas of Cumberland or York County or any other appropriate forum
through the Authority's Solicitor for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order
or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The
Township or Authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Authority prior to the date of any show cause or termination
hearing under § 175-87 or § 175-92 of this article.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 175-64 of this article, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 175-42 through
175-47 of this article.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 175-87 of this
article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.

treatment works Penalty Law, Act of the General Assembly of March 26,
1992, P.L. 23, No. 9, subject to the appeal procedures as specified in 2
Pa.C.S.A. for any industrial user in noncompliance.
§ 175-95. Criminal prosecution.
Any person who knowingly, willfully or intentionally makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant
to this article, or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers
with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this article, will be prosecuted to the extent permitted by
law under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
§ 175-96. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The Township
or Authority may take any, all or any combination of these actions against
a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally
be in accordance with the Authority's enforcement response plan. However,
the Township or Authority may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the Township or Authority is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
§ 175-97. Performance bonds.
The Authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision
of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Authority, in
a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Authority to be necessary to
achieve consistent compliance.
§ 175-98. Liability insurance.
The Authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater
discharge to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this
article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 175-99. Payment of outstanding fees and penalties.
The Authority may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees,

§ 175-100. Eligibility for receipt of contractual award.
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and Requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award
for the sale of goods or services to the Township and Authority. Existing
contracts for the sale of goods or services to the Township and Authority
held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment
standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the
Township and Authority.
§ 175-101. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection C; below are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Authority
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. (If this information
is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days.):
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

§ 175-102. Affirmative defense of prohibited discharge
enforcement.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 175-42A of
this article or the specific prohibitions in § 175-42B(1)(c) through (g) and (i)
through (r) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from
other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
§ 175-103. Bypass.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or
fails.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough
or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
Authority was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in
the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use
or disposal requirements.
A. For the purposes of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These

separate resolution and amended as required.
bypasses are not subject to the provisions of Subsections C and D of
this section.
C. Bypass notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Authority at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Authority of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of
the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue;
and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Authority may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
D. Bypass prohibited; exceptions.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Township or Authority may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
(2) The Township or Authority may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Authority determines
that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection D(1) of
this section.

Yard waste, as defined above, may not be disposed of as refuse, nor mixed
with refuse for collection by the Township or the Township collector. There
is therefore established in the Township a yard waste collection program for
persons residing in residential dwellings from which solid waste is collected
by or on behalf of the Township
§ 180-19. Precollection practice.
A. Preparation of Christmas trees, leaf waste and yard waste.
(1) Preparation for collection by the Township or Township collector.
(a) All Christmas trees must have all ornaments, tinsel and other
decorations removed. Trees may not be placed in plastic bags.
Trees may be placed at curbside on the appropriate day or
delivered to the Township recycling facility.
(b) Leaves must be raked to curbside in order to be picked up by
Township equipment. Leaves packed into recyclable paper
(Kraft) bags will not be picked up at curbside, but may be
dropped off at the Township recycling facility.

such cans are placed a minimum of six feet away from regular
refuse. Branches may not exceed three inches in diameter.
(d) All materials shall be otherwise prepared for collection in
accordance with any regulations established by the Township
Manager.
(2) Preparation for collection by Township licensee. The manner of
preparation of Christmas trees, leaf waste and yard waste for
collection by a Township licensee is a matter of agreement between
the private parties involved; provided, however, that such manner
shall be subject to the power of regulation of the Township
Manager and shall not be unnecessarily offensive to the senses,
attractive to vectors, creative of other nuisances, unsafe or
unhealthy.
B. Collection by Township collector or by Township licensee.
(1) Collection by Township collector.
(a) Persons may dispose of oversized yard waste by contracting
privately with the Township collector or with a Township

kept in good condition. Any container that does not conform to
this article or that is likely to injure the collector or his
employees or hampers the prompt collection of refuse shall be
replaced upon notice. Failure to replace such defective
container may result in the stoppage of service until such time
as the container is replaced.
(2) Storing of yard waste. No person shall place any yard waste in any
street, alley or public place or upon any private property, whether
owned by such person or not, within the Township, except as
properly prepared in § 180-19A(1) for collection or under an
express approval by the Township Manager. No person shall throw
or dump any yard waste in any stream or other body of water.

a given property shall be placed at ground level on the property,
along or near the curb abutting said property and not within the
cartway of a street or alley, unless agreed to by the Township and
the Township collector. Where there is no curb, it shall be placed
immediately next to the paved portion of the roadway. Said material
shall be accessible and not more than 10 feet from the side or curb
of the street or alley from which collection is made, nor may be
placed less than 10 feet from regular refuse. Said placement for
collection shall be not more than 24 hours prior to the time of the
scheduled collection.
(2) Collection by a contractor. Points of collection of yard waste by a
licensed contractor are a matter for agreement between the private
parties involved; provided, however, that such points shall be
subject to the power of regulation of the Township Manager, that no
cartway of a street or alley shall be employed as a point for the
placing of bundles and containers, that no sidewalk shall be
employed for the placing of such bundles or containers in a manner
which disrupts its function and that such points shall not constitute
a nuisance, health or safety peril or unnecessary offense to the
senses.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 184-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Lower Allen Township
Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 184-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 184-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 184-2 of this chapter through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
E. Nonstormwater discharges to storm sewer systems can contribute to
pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
§ 184-1 SOLID WASTE § 184-3
180:309
§ 184-4. Statutory authority.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management (SWM) best management practices (BMPs)
that are implemented within the municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
I. Meet general water quality and soil disturbance goals by implementing
measures to:
(1) Maintain or extend riparian buffers and protect existing forested
buffer.
(2) Establish and maintain nonerosive flow conditions in natural flow
pathways.
(3) Minimize soil disturbance and soil compaction.
(4) Direct runoff to pervious areas, wherever possible.
(5) Incorporate the techniques for low-impact development practices
described in the most current version of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (SWM Manual).
(6) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of the commonwealth.

activity at a project site in the municipality.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one
§ 184-10 SOLID WASTE § 184-10
180:313
of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural."
In this chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational
and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.
CHANNEL EROSION  The widening, deepening and headward
cutting of small channels and waterways due to erosion caused by
moderate-to-large floods.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  The Cumberland County Conservation
District (CCCD).
CULVERT  A structure with appurtenant works which carries a
stream under or through an embankment or fill.
DEP  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM  The magnitude and temporal distribution of
precipitation from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence
(e.g., a five-year-storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours), used in the design
and evaluation of stormwater management systems. See also "return
period."
DETENTION VOLUME  The volume of runoff that is captured and
then infiltrated, evaporated, reused or released into the waters of this
commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)  See "project site."
DISCONNECTED IMPERVIOUS AREA (DIA)  An impervious or
impermeable surface which has its stormwater runoff disconnected
from any stormwater drainage or conveyance system and is redirected
or directed to a pervious area which allows for infiltration, filtration and
increased time of concentration.
DISTURBED AREA  An unstabilized land area where an earth
disturbance activity is occurring or has occurred.
EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY  A construction or other human
activity which disturbs the surface of the land, including land clearing
and grubbing, grading, excavations, embankments, land development,
agricultural plowing or tilling, operation of animal-heavy use areas,
timber harvesting activities, road maintenance activities, oil and gas
activities, well drilling, mineral extraction and the moving, depositing,
stockpiling or storing of soil, rock or earth materials.
§ 184-10 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 184-10
180:314
EROSION  The movement of soil particles by the action of water,
wind, ice, chemical or other actions.
EXISTING CONDITION  The initial condition of a project site prior to
the proposed construction.
FEMA  Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FLOODPLAIN  The lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland
and coastal waters, including, at a minimum, that area subject to a onepercent-
or-greater chance of flooding in any given year.
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the one-hundred-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the
boundary of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance
studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies
have defined the boundary of the one-hundred-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends
from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and
activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include
conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management
plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and
construction, timber harvesting, site preparation and reforestation.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Refers to soils grouped according
to their runoff-producing characteristics. The chief consideration is
the inherent capacity of soil bare of vegetation to permit infiltration.
Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface
permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are classified into
four HSGs (A, B, C and D) according to their minimum infiltration rate,
which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS
defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils
become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D [NRCS (References
3 and 487].
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to, compacted aggregate,
roofs, patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures, and streets
or sidewalks, driveways, parking areas and other paved surfaces.
KARST  A type of topography or landscape characterized by surface
depressions, sinkholes, rock pinnacles/uneven bedrock surface,
underground drainage and caves. Karst is formed on carbonate rocks,
such as limestone or dolomite.

LAND DEVELOPMENT (DEVELOPMENT)  Inclusive of any of the
following activities:
MUNICIPALITY  Lower Allen Township, Cumberland County,
Pennsylvania.
NRCS  USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (previously
SCS).
PEAK DISCHARGE  The maximum rate of stormwater runoff from a
specific storm event.
PENNDOT  The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
PERVIOUS AREA  Any area not defined as impervious.
PROJECT SITE  The specific area of land where any regulated
activities in the municipality are planned, conducted or maintained.
QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL  Any person licensed by the
Pennsylvania Department of State or otherwise qualified by law to
perform the work required by this chapter.
REGULATED ACTIVITIES  Shall include, but not be limited to, any
earth disturbance activities or any activities that involve the alteration
or development of land in a manner that may affect stormwater runoff
as specified in § 184-5.
REGULATED EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY  Activity involving
earth disturbance subject to regulation under 25 Pa. Code Chapters 92a
and 102, or the Clean Streams Law.88

§ 184-13. Volume controls.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below for
all regulated activities not otherwise exempted by § 184-12. For regulated
activity areas equal to or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with
each methodology and other factors.

0.25 to 0.5 10,890 to 21,780 2,500
Greater than 0.5 Greater than 21,780 5,000
A. The Design Storm Method (See Section 8.7 of the most current version
of the SWM Manual.) is applicable to any size of regulated activity. This
method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes: Calculate existing (pre-development)
stormwater runoff and infiltration volumes based on existing site
conditions, as verified through design phase soil infiltration testing.
B. The Simplified Method (See Section 8.7 of the most current version of
the SWM Manual,) provided below is independent of site conditions and
should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method
is not applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for
projects that require design of stormwater detention or rate control
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall be sized to capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow  i.e., it shall
not be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth.
Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.

180:321
§ 184-14. Rate controls.
See Section 8.3 of the most current version of the SWM Manual.
§ 184-15. Stormwater management districts.
(3) Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate
infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases, at least the first 1/2 inch of the permanently removed
runoff shall be infiltrated.
(4) The second one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall
be detained using structural and nonstructural BMPs (as outlined
in the most current version of the SWM Manual) and released at a
controlled rate, unless permanently removed from the runoff flow.
A. Areas not covered by the Cedar Run Watershed or Yellow Breeches
Creek Lower Watershed Release Rate Maps: Post-development
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates
for the one-, two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storms. If it is shown that
the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis
are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
pre-development analysis for one-, two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year
twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have
been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as
necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. Areas covered by the Cedar Run Watershed or Yellow Breeches Creek
Lower Watershed Release Rate Maps (See Appendix B95): For the one-,
two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storms, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps.
(See Appendix B.) For any areas not shown on the release rate maps,
the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates.
A. The municipality has been divided into two stormwater management
districts as shown on the Cedar Run Watershed and Yellow Breeches
Creek Lower Watershed Release Rate Maps in Appendix B.96 All areas
of the municipality not specifically identified on the Watershed Release
Rate Map are assumed to be in the One-Hundred-Percent Release Rate
District.
B. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea for the one-, two-,
ten-, and one-hundred-year design storms are shown below.
Development sites located in each of the districts must control postdevelopment
runoff rates to pre-development runoff rates for the design
storms as follows:

provisions; performance standards.
District Control Criteria
One-Hundred-
Percent
Post-development peak discharge for all design
storms must be no greater than pre-development
peak discharges.
Seventy-Five-
Percent
Post-development peak discharge for all design
storms must be no greater than 75% of the predevelopment
peak discharges.
A. General. Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Runoff Peak Rate
Districts Map, Appendix B97 and § 184-15, of this chapter.
B. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on the Cedar Run Watershed and Yellow Breeches
Creek Lower Watershed Release Rate Maps, which are available for
inspection at the municipal office. Copies of the maps, at reduced scale,
are included in the Appendix B.
C. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more release rate districts, the peak discharge
rate from any subarea shall be the pre-development peak discharge for
that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate. The calculated
peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan
changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the above may
be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity
to the site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a
release rate of 100% provided that the overall site discharge meets the
weighted average release rate.
D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed
to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria.
F. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
97.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 184-15 SOLID WASTE § 184-16
180:323
§ 184-17. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at a minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
G. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas, it may be more cost
effective to provide one control facility for more than one development
site than to provide an individual control facility for each development
site. The initiative and funding for any regional runoff control
alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The
design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable
development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak outflow of a
regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis using the
hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the
downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the
calibrated model as developed for the Stormwater Management Plan.
H. Waiver of peak rate control requirement. For certain development sites
in close proximity to stream channels, the municipality may consider a
waiver of the peak rate control requirement, upon recommendation of
the Municipal Engineer. The developer is responsible to demonstrate no
harm by providing engineering analysis, in accordance with the
following:
(1) The developer must demonstrate that discharge without peak rate
control will improve drainage conditions by draining the
development site prior to peak stream flows from the upstream
drainage area.
(2) The developer must demonstrate that all drainage facilities
downstream from the site have adequate capacity to safely convey
the undetained increased peak flows for the storm events listed in
§ 184-14. This analysis may be required for any drainage facility
between the development site and the discharge point at the Yellow
Breeches Creek. Approval of a detention waiver shall not relieve
the developer from meeting the volume control (§ 184-13)
requirements.
§ 184-16 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 184-17
180:324
A. Detention and retention facilities.
(1) Any stormwater management facility or BMP designed to store
runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this chapter shall be designed to provide an
emergency spillway to handle flow up to and including the onehundred-
year post-development conditions.
(2) The height of the embankment must be set as to provide a
minimum of one foot of freeboard above the maximum pool
elevation computed when the facility functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow.
(3) Emergency spillways must be designed to pass the one-hundredyear
post-development flow, assuming that all discharge orifices
are completely clogged and that any principal spillway grate is 50%
clogged.
(4) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under DEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety, which may be required to pass storms
larger than the one-hundred-year event.
B. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges,
outfalls, or stream enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as
directed in DEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced from
time to time by DEP), shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105
and will require a permit from DEP. Any other drainage conveyance
facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be able to
convey, without damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff
from the twenty-five-year design storm with a minimum of one-foot of
freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of the
embankment along the edge of the roadway. Any facility that
constitutes a dam as defined in DEP Chapter 105 regulations may
require a permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility located
within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design
standards and permit submission requirements.
C. Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from a
twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging inlets.
D. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
E. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The municipality shall
reserve the right to disapprove any design that would result in the
creation, occupancy or continuation of an adverse hydrologic or
hydraulic condition.
F. Storm drainage facilities shall be required as necessary to:
§ 184-17 SOLID WASTE § 184-17
180:325
(1) Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses;
(2) Ensure the drainage of all low points along the line of streets and
other applicable areas;
(3) Intercept, retain or detain surface water runoff in a manner
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained;
(4) Provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal
facilities and buildings.
G. General storm drainage facility design requirements:
(1) Design of storm drainage facilities shall generally conform with
PennDOT Design Manual Part 2, Chapter 10.
(2) The minimum design criteria shall be a ten-year storm with a fiveminute
duration. Higher frequency conditions may be required by
the municipality where an overflow would endanger public or
private properties.
(3) The complete drainage system for the subdivision or land
development shall be incorporated into the design. If the
subdivision or land development is to be developed in phases, an
overall stormwater facilities plan for the entire site shall be
submitted with the preliminary plan.
(4) The developer shall be responsible for obtaining any permits
required by state or federal agencies for construction of the
facilities or points of discharge. Copies of hydrologic or other
studies requested by other agencies shall be provided by the
developer.
(5) The existing points of drainage discharge, whether natural or
constructed, shall not be altered without written approval from the
affected property owner(s).
(6) Stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall not be diverted
so as to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or
the need for additional drainage structures on other private
properties or public lands, without provisions being made by the
developer for properly handling such conditions.
(7) Facilities for storm drainage shall be designed to handle the
anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided or
developed as well to handle the anticipated increase in runoff that
will occur when all upstream property is fully developed.
(8) Where a watercourse runs across or through a subdivision or land
development, a drainage easement, which conforms with the line of
such watercourse, shall be provided at such a width as will be
adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage.
§ 184-17 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 184-17
180:326
Provisions for reasonable access for maintenance of these facilities
shall be provided.
(9) All drainage structures that are located within the right-of-way of
state highway agencies shall be approved by the applicable agency.
(10) All streets shall be designed so that surface water is discharged
from their cartways and rights-of-way. The minimum street crossslope
shall be 2%.
(11) Storm drainage facilities, as required, shall be placed in front of the
curb or curbline when located in a street right-of-way. When
located in undedicated land, facilities shall be placed within an
easement, as approved by the Municipal Engineer, who may
require additional width of easement as circumstances warrant.
(12) Street drainage shall not be permitted to cross intersections or the
center line of a road.
(13) Stormwater roof drains, sump pump discharge drains and other
stormwater drainage facilities or groundwater discharges shall not:
(a) Discharge directly over a sidewalk.
(b) Discharge within five feet of any lot line.
(c) Cross a lot line.
(d) Be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers or roadside
ditches, to promote overland flow and infiltration of
stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is more
advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers,
then it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the
municipality.
(14) Stabilized outlets shall be provided for footer drains, floor drains,
downspouts and other point discharges.
(15)No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the flow
of, alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or thing or
commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any stream
or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from
applicable local, state and federal agencies.
(16) All street inlets shall be the combination inlet and hood type in
compliance with PennDOT Standard Construction Drawings for
Type C Special Inlet. The designation of "special" means a ten-inch
curb reveal which requires the road surface to be sloped into the
inlet for additional effectiveness. Inlets shall be constructed of
reinforced cast-in-place concrete or precast concrete with separate
bottom and top units.
§ 184-17 SOLID WASTE § 184-17
180:327
(17) All storm drainage system manholes shall be reinforced cast-inplace
concrete or precast concrete in compliance with PennDOT
Standard Construction Drawings.

drainage is contributed. All pipes shall meet PennDOT
specifications. A headwall or end section shall be provided at the
start and end of each pipe run.
(19) All springs and sump pump discharges shall be collected by piping
so as not to flow in the streets.
(20) Underdrain shall be required at all low points on the street profile.
The underdrain system shall be designed and installed in
accordance with PennDOT specifications. Combination storm

the municipality from time to time. Where adopted, such standards
shall take precedence over PennDOT standards that are referenced
herein.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on-and off-site areas, shall use a generally
accepted calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover
complex method. Table 184-1 summarizes acceptable computation
methods. It is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design
professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of each
method for a particular site. The municipality may approve the use of
the Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas
that contain less than 200 acres.

D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland flow
and return periods from the design storm curves from PennDOT Design
Rainfall Curves (1986). Times of concentration for overland flow shall
be calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban

§ 184-19. Erosion and sediment control requirements.
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in size, the
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method
that produces a full hydrograph. The municipality may approve the use
of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that
shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a
method that produces a full hydrograph.
J. The municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions. If the
designer can substantiate through actual physical calibration that more
appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration values should be utilized
at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon
review and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer. Calibration
shall require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the particular site in
question.
K. An impervious area flash (IAF) analysis shall be conducted for all sites.
The analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be modeled
without the pervious areas. The time of concentration should also be
determined from the impervious areas only. If the IAF analysis results in
a higher post-development peak runoff rate, this higher value must be
used for the final design/comparison.
A. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," and in
accordance with the Cumberland County Conservation District (CCCD)
and the standards and specifications of the municipality.
B. No regulated activities shall commence until an erosion and sediment
control plan consistent with this chapter is approved by the
municipality.
C. Evidence of any permits required by DEP or CCCD must be provided to
the municipality.
D. Plan review, approval and permitting functions under this section may
be delegated by the municipality to another entity, if such agreement is
entered into by the municipality.
§ 184-18 SOLID WASTE § 184-19
180:331
E. Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria
that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed include the
following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
F. A copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan and any
required permits shall be available at the project site at all times.
G. Any permanent stormwater detention or retention facility that also
functions as a sediment control facility during construction must be
designed to meet the permanent peak rate release design requirements
for the ten-year storm event during the construction period.
Documentation of this design shall be included in the stormwater
management report. This requirement is in addition to design
parameters that may be required by other agencies.

No person shall make or cause to be made any excavation of any nature
whatsoever in any street, highway, alley or thoroughfare within the limits of
the township without first securing a permit granting authority therefor as
hereinafter provided.
§ 187-3. Information for permit application.
Any application for the issuance of an excavation permit shall be filed in
the office of the Township Manager or his designee, upon forms furnished
by the township for that purpose, and shall be signed by the applicant.
Such application shall set forth the location and purpose of the proposed
excavation, the dates between which such excavation is to be opened, the
length, width and depth of the trench, the area of the roadway surfaces to
be removed, the date on which all work will be completed and the names of
all persons interested in or to be benefited by the work to be done.
§ 187-4. Deposit for restoration. [Amended 10-13-1986 by Ord. No.
86-9]
Before issuance of an excavation permit, the Township Manager or his
designee shall collect from the applicant and the applicant shall deposit

Upon an application for the issuance of an excavation permit being
approved by the Township Manager or his designee and the deposit by
the applicant with the Township Manager or his designee, the deposit
determined in accordance with the provisions of § 187-4, there shall be
issued to the applicant a permit granting authority to make the excavations
specified in the application. This permit shall at all times be in the
possession of a competent person actually on the work and shall be shown
at all times to any police officer or properly authorized officer or employee
of the township upon demand. The Township Manager or his designee shall
have the right to refuse to permit an excavation during the period from
November 15 to March 15, unless directed by the Board of Commissioners
to grant such permit. All permits are subject to revocation at any time by
the Township Manager or his designee or by the Board of Commissioners
in the event of failure of the holder of such permit to comply with any of
the conditions upon which the permit has been granted; such conditions,
however, shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. All
permits shall be invalid and expire on the date set forth therein. An

§ 187-2 SOLID WASTE § 187-5
180:357
additional fee per day as set forth from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners.
§ 187-6. Liability.
By acceptance of the excavation permit, the applicant agrees to pay the
entire cost and expense incurred in the replacement of the excavation
and agrees to protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the township
and the officers, agents, servants or employees thereof from all claims,
suits, actions and proceedings of every nature and description which may
be brought against the township, officers, agents, servants or employees
thereof or for any injuries or damage to persons or public or private
property due to any materials or appliances used in the work or by or
on account of improper materials or workmanship or for or on account of
any accident or any other act, negligence or omission of such applicant or
his agents servants or employees, and the township, the officers, agents,
servants or employees thereof shall not in any way be liable therefor. The
applicant agrees to safeguard and maintain in good order the excavation
until such time as the township may restore the street surface, and the
applicant further agrees to abide by all the terms and conditions of this
article whether specifically mentioned in the application or not. The grant
of a permit by the township does not relieve the applicant from obtaining
any consent otherwise required from the owner or owners of the abutting
property and does not confer upon the applicant the right to cut, remove
or destroy trees or shrubbery within the legal limits of the street, highway,
alley or thoroughfare except under such conditions, restrictions and
regulations as the permit may specifically prescribe.
§ 187-7. Tunneling prohibited; exception.
No part of a trench or excavation shall be tunneled or undermined so as
to leave the surface undisturbed, but all materials shall be removed to the
full length, width and depth of the excavation, except in such cases as may
be approved by the Township Manager or his designee. The charges for the
permit, however, shall be the same as if the surface had been removed.
§ 187-8. Safeguards.
The applicant, during the progress of the excavation work, shall provide
and maintain such fences, barriers, "street closed" or "danger" signs, red
lights and watchmen as may be necessary to prevent avoidable accidents
to the public and adjoining property owners. The convenience of the public
and temporary approaches to and crossings of intersecting streets shall be
provided for and kept in good condition when practicable. The sidewalks or
portions of the street adjoining the work or its vicinity shall not be littered
or obstructed more than necessary, and the drainage gutters and inlets to
the stormwater sewers shall at all times be kept clean and unobstructed.
Plates or bridging may be required on all openings made within the
improved surface which have a shortest dimension in length or width of
six feet or less whenever work cannot be completed within the same day,
§ 187-5 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 187-8
180:358
during peak traffic hours. The plate or bridging is to be extended a
minimum of 18 inches on either side of the opening and tied into the
existing cartway.102
§ 187-9. Supervision.
The Township Manager or his designee or his duly authorized
representative shall have authority to regulate the excavation and shall
have authority to see that the excavation is filled and closed as required by
this article.
§ 187-10. Procedure.
A. Excavations shall be by open cut from the surface, and no tunneling or
drifting shall be permitted except by permission as required by § 187-7
and so noted on the permit. Where there is an asphalt or macadam
surface, the surface shall be cut with a jackhammer or a saw to the
width of one foot on either side of the maximum trench width. The
amount of trench opened shall at all times be subject to the decision of
the Township Manager or his designee. No trench or excavation shall
be undercut or have a greater width at the bottom than at the top. In
case of slips or slides of the sides of the excavation, the same shall be
trimmed to solid earth and the top surface cut back to the limit of the
same before any backfilling is commenced. When necessary or
required, the sides of a trench shall be sheathed and braced and
rendered secure until the construction has been laid therein and the
trench refilled.
B. Care shall be taken not to move or disturb other subsurface structures,
and in crossing these or running parallel with or near them, they shall
be securely hung, braced and supported in place until the work is
completed. The applicant shall maintain their respective services and
shall repair all damages done to any of such structures.
C. In rock excavation, all drilling and blasting shall be conducted with the
greatest possible care and all possible precautions taken to guard
against accidents, and if the applicant is required to use certain
blasting operations in the excavation, the applicant shall agree to make,
execute and deliver to the township a bond in the sum stipulated by the
Township Manager or his designee, with surety in the form approved by
the Township Manager or his designee, conditioned that the applicant
will save harmless the township from any damage whatsoever to its
subgrade, special subgrade, subbase, drainage facilities, road material
and any other installations or matters in, under or upon the highway
right-of-way for a period from the date of the completion of the last
work covered by the permit.
102. Editor's Note: Original Section 901.09, Notification to officials, which immediately
followed this section, was deleted at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I).
§ 187-8 SOLID WASTE § 187-11
180:359
§ 187-11. Restoration materials and methods.
A. The person making or causing to be made the excavation shall retain
suitable material from the excavated trench to provide insulation
around and over subsurface structures, including but not limited to
pipes or conduits, not to exceed 12 inches over the same, and it shall be
compacted in four-inch layers. This excavated material shall be stored
at the side of the excavation in such a manner that there will be no
interference with the flow of water in any gutter, drain, pipe, culvert or
ditch. The remaining excavated material shall be removed from the site.
Completion of the backfill and restoration of the base and surface
course shall be performed by the Township Highway Department, but
the township may, at its option, require the applicant to backfill and
restore the base and surface course at the sole cost and expense of the
applicant in accordance with the following requirements:
(1) Surface replaced five years or less prior to permit application.
(a) Suitable material from the excavated trench must be retained
to provide insulation around and over the utilities, if any, to a
height not to exceed 12 inches over the top of the pipe,
conduit, etc. This material shall be compacted in four-inch
layers. This material shall be placed or stored on the side of the
operation farthest from the road pavement, unless otherwise
authorized in the permit, and in such manner that there will be
no interference with the flow of water in any gutter, drain,
pipe, culvert, ditch or waterway. The remaining excavated
material must be removed from the site. The trench must then
be backfilled with 2A modified limestone compacted in layers
not to exceed four inches, using the mechanical tamper up to
within four inches of the finished grade. The 2A modified
limestone must meet the requirements of Section 703.3(D),
Form 408, as specified in the latest revision of the
specifications issued by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation.
(b) The surface course shall be replaced in accordance with the
depths of existing bituminous surface, but in no case shall the
wearing course be less than four inches of ID-2A. The edges
shall be sealed with two applications of E-8 emulsion. An
additional one foot on each side of the trench must be sawed or
cut in a neat straight line prior to replacing the bituminous
surface and the base course as specified above.
(2) Surface replaced in excess of five years prior to application for
permit.
(a) The method of trench backfilling shall be in accordance with
the requirements as set forth in Subsection A(1) hereof.
(b) The base course and binder and surface course shall be
replaced in accordance with the requirements as set forth in
§ 187-11 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 187-11
180:360
§ 187-12. Necessary additional work; supplemental application.
In no case shall an applicant open or remove a greater area of surface and
in no other location than specified in the original application. However, if,
at the time of actually doing the work, it is necessary to open or remove a
greater area of surface than originally applied for, the applicant shall first
notify and secure, by telephone or otherwise, the consent of the Township
Manager or his designee to do so, upon the express condition that the
applicant, before 12:00 noon of the following business day, files a
supplemental application for the making of an additional excavation.
§ 187-13. Increased area; charges; refunds.
Before the backfilling of any excavation, the Township Manager or his
designee shall verify the actual area of the excavation. If actual area of the
excavation exceeds the area of the excavation set forth in the application
for a permit and the amount required to backfill and restore the street
determined in accordance with the schedule of charges per square yard
set forth in § 187-4 exceeds the amount deposited by the applicant, then
the excess shall be charged to the applicant. Where the completion of the
backfilling and restoration of the base and surface course is to be performed
by the Township Highway Department, the Township Highway Department,
as soon as practicable to do so, shall permanently backfill, replace and
restore the pavement surface in such manner and with like material existing
in the roadway previous to the making of the excavation and shall determine
and charge the cost of backfilling and restoring of the base and surface
course to the applicant, together with any other charges to the applicant
Subsection A(1) hereof. Where the applicant backfills and
restores the base and surface course, the applicant shall be
responsible for any failure of the highway surface during a
period of two years following completion of the permanent
restoration work. The township may require, in its discretion,
that the applicant furnish a bond, conditioned that the
applicant shall complete and maintain the work in accordance
with the terms of this article, sufficient in amount to cover
the cost of the required improvements, as estimated by the
Township Engineer.
B. In the case of an improved street or alley, fill shall be replaced in
excavation in eight-inch layers and tamped with an approved gasoline
or mechanical tamper, and a suitable top of ballast and fine stone shall
be placed on the excavation to a minimum depth of 10 inches.
C. Excavation in grassed areas of street rights-of-way shall be backfilled
with excavated material, compacted in eight-inch lifts. Excavated sod
shall be removed and preserved for replacement after excavation. If the
excavated sod is destroyed, new sod shall be replaced over excavation.
D. Backfill operations shall be done in the presence of the Township
Manager or his designee.
§ 187-11 SOLID WASTE § 187-13
180:361
authorized by this article. The township shall retain a like amount of all
sums deposited by the applicant for the permit. The township shall refund
to the applicant the difference where the amount deposited exceeds the cost
and expense determined by the township for the backfill and restoration of
the pavement and surface area and any other costs or expenses chargeable
to the applicant under the terms and provisions of this article or where
the applicant, when required, performs the backfilling and restoration of
the base and surface course; and where the completion of the backfill and
restoration of the base and surface course is performed by the Township
Highway Department and it is determined that the cost and expense of the
backfilling and restoration of the base and surface course and any other
costs and expenses chargeable to the applicant under the provisions of this
article exceed the amount so deposited, then the excess shall be charged
to the applicant. The sum due the township shall be paid within 30 days
from the date of rendering a statement to the applicant, and no permit shall
be issued to any applicant until all accounts due the township on previous
permits granted to the applicant and owing by the applicant shall have been
paid. Notwithstanding any provision herein set forth to the contrary, 15%
of the total cost and expenses for all street excavations shall be retained by
the township for inspection and supervision.
§ 187-14. Emergencies. [Amended 11-9-1998 by Ord. No. 98-12]
In case of an emergency arising at night, Sundays, legal holidays or at
such times as the office of the Township Manager or his designee is closed
and an immediate excavation may be necessary for the protection of public
or private property, the same shall be reported to the Police Department,
which shall immediately notify the Township Manager or his designee of
the excavation. The person granting permission to make the emergency
excavation shall make application for said excavation to the Township
Manager or his designee on or before 12:00 noon of the next business day.
§ 187-15. Inspection.
The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to place an inspector on
any and all excavations it deems necessary in order to ensure good
workmanship, and the actual expense of such inspection shall be charged to
the applicant.
§ 187-16. Work beyond street center line; length.
No excavation in any street, highway, alley or thoroughfare shall extend
from the curbline into the highway a distance greater than one foot beyond
the center line of the street, highway, alley or thoroughfare before being
backfilled and the surface of the highway restored to a condition safe and
convenient for travel. No more than 500 feet longitudinally shall be opened
in any street at any one time, unless written permission has been granted
by the Board of Commissioners or the Township Manager or his designee.
§ 187-13 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 187-17
180:362
§ 187-17. Work not properly completed; penalty.
If the excavation is not performed promptly or shall be unskillfully or
improperly or incompletely done, the Board of Commissioners may cause
the same to be done in a manner it deems proper, and the expense thereof,
including any overhead expense, shall be charged to the applicant, together
with 15% additional as a penalty.
§ 187-18. Exemptions to required deposit.
No deposit shall be required and no charge shall be made for an excavation
made under permits issued for the construction or repair of sidewalks,
curbing or gutters nor for a contract executed by the township, but in all
other cases, proper application shall be made and permits secured as herein
provided.

Temporary Right-of-Way Obstructions Ordinance."
§ 187-62. Intent. [Amended 6-24-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-02]
It is the intent of the Board of Commissioners to protect the health and
safety of the residents and visitors of Lower Allen Township by restricting
or prohibiting the use of public rights-of-way for temporary obstructions.
After a review of safety issues, the Board of Commissioners has determined
that placement of temporary obstructions in the public right-of-way is a
hazard to the public safety, since they can obstruct the sight distance of
motorists using the public street and obstructs public rights-of-way for use
by emergency vehicles. Moreover, it also obstructs snowplows and other
Township maintenance crews from their public responsibilities. Further,
the continued use of temporary right-of-way obstructions may result in the
damage to the property of Township residents.

A. It shall be unlawful for any person to place any obstruction in the
cartway portion of the public right-of-way.
B. It shall be unlawful for any person to place any obstruction in the public
right-of-way that projects into the required eight feet of height
clearance over Township sidewalks or 14 feet of height clearance over
Township cartways including, but not limited to, basketball goals.
[Amended 6-24-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-02]
C. No roll-off container, storage pod or similar container shall be placed
upon any street or public right-of-way. Any person seeking a temporary
exemption from this article may make said application to the Township
Manager, who will review the application for the following criteria:
[Added 6-24-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-02]
(1) Will the placement create a safety hazard or sight distance
obstruction.
(2) Valid reasons why the ROW obstruction cant be placed on the
property instead of the street.
(3) Reasonable duration of the placement.

is proposed to be deferred and the draft text of an agreement
to carry out this subsection. The agreement shall be in a legally
binding document that is acceptable to the Township. The list
of information that is deferred shall require written approval
by the Board of Commissioners. The agreement shall be
prepared in a manner that is binding upon all of the applicant's
heirs, successors and assigns.

road data, utility profiles, grading plans, stormwater
calculations, improvement construction details and road
profiles, provided that the applicant shall be required to show
that design standards will be met.
(c) In place of submitting this information at the preliminary plan
stage, an applicant shall submit sufficient information at the
preliminary plan stage to demonstrate the feasibility of
proposed development. The Township Engineer, Planning
Commission or Board of Commissioners may require that
specific information be provided to show this feasibility. This

fully function in a coordinated manner, even if all stages are
not completed.

showing the proposed development, including the item that is
requested to be waived or modified, and a plan showing the proposed
development if the waiver or modification is granted.

fees, requirements for escrow accounts and a payment procedure for all
applications and other matters pertaining to this chapter. The applicant
shall pay the reasonable charges by the Township's Engineer and other
professional consultants for review of the proposed project and for
related preparation of reports and meeting time. At the time of
submittal of a final plan, the applicant shall also be required to deposit

deposited by the applicant. If expenses exceed the amount placed into
escrow, such excess expenses shall be paid by the applicant prior to
recording of the final plans. If the funds exceed the amount of the
expenses, the balance remaining shall be refunded to the applicant,
without interest, after inspection and final release by the Board of
Commissioners of any security posted with respect to maintenance or
repair of the improvements.

sewer, building, zoning, etc., shall be paid to the Township or
Authority, as applicable.

bill submitted under or within the time specified in this section
shall be a reason for disapproval of the final plan or revocation of
any building or zoning permit issued to the applicant or the
applicant's heirs, successors or assigns.

revision of a previously submitted plan, the Township may
require the applicant to submit additional amounts into an
escrow account or other fees if needed based upon the
Township's expenditures on the review up to that time. If any

General Procedures
§ 192-23. Purpose.
This article summarizes the general procedures for the submission and
review of proposed subdivisions and land developments. This article is only
a general explanation and is not binding on the Township or an applicant.
See the actual provisions of the other articles of this chapter.
§ 192-24. General procedure for subdivisions and land
developments.
A. Review and approval stages. Three types of plan submissions are
established: sketch, preliminary and final, as outlined below.

NOTES:
(1) See definitions in Article II.
(2) See Article VII for minor subdivision final plan submission and
review requirements. See § 192-41 for submission requirements
for a lot line adjustment.
(3) At their option, the Board of Commissioners may grant a waiver
of the preliminary plan requirement if the plan submission meets
the requirements of a final plan submission.
(4) Except where exempted by § 192-30.
(5) If applicant chooses to use the conservation subdivision option, a
sketch plan is required.
B. Sketch plan. While a sketch plan is not required, it is strongly
recommended that it be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and
informally with the Township staff and Planning Commission before
§ 192-23 SOLID WASTE § 192-24
180:405
§ 192-25. General plan submission procedures.
preparing a preliminary plan. This will often avoid expensive redesign
and delay to the applicant.
C. Preliminary plan. Preliminary plans are required to be submitted for
any major subdivision and for certain land developments, as described
above.
D. Final plan. After approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision
or certain land developments, and to obtain approval of a minor
subdivision, the applicant must file a final plan. A final plan must be
approved prior to recording of the plans at the County Recorder of
Deeds Office and prior to the sale of any lots or the construction of any
buildings. (See Article IX.)
E. Guarantee of improvements installation. Where improvements are
required by this chapter, the Township will require that the applicant
enter into a development agreement, including the posting of financial
security sufficient to guarantee the costs of any improvements which
may be required. See Article VIII.
A. Submission. Sketch, preliminary and final plans and all required
accompanying information are required to be submitted to the
Township staff.
B. Completeness. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to
recommend rejection by the Board of Commissioners or to table an
application that the Commission determines is significantly incomplete.
C. Attendance. The applicant or his/her duly authorized representative
should attend the Commission meeting to discuss the filed plans. The
Commission may request such attendance. If the applicant fails to
appear when so requested at a meeting where the plans will be
considered, it may result in plan disapproval, if the Township
determines that it resulted in insufficient information to render a
decision.
D. Action by the Commission and the Board of Commissioners. The
Planning Commission advises the Board of Commissioners on proposed
plans. There are time limits in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code136 for approval of a subdivision or land development, unless the
applicant grants a time extension.

180:406
ARTICLE IV
Sketch Plan
§ 192-26. Pre-plan consultation.
Prior to submitting a sketch plan, applicants are encouraged to informally
discuss their proposal with the Township staff. See also discussion of a site
inspection in § 192-29.
§ 192-27. Sketch plan submission requirements.
Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, applicants are very strongly
encouraged to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan review often allows
an applicant to save substantial time and engineering costs because many
concerns about layout and issues concerning Township ordinances can be
resolved prior to detailed engineering. This can often reduce the need
for future redesign at a more detailed stage, thereby saving the applicant
significant money and time. When submitted, sketch plans shall include the
following information:
A. Submission requirement. If submitted, 17 print copies of the sketch
plan and the accompanying application should be submitted to the
Township staff prior to a regular Township Planning Commission
meeting. It is strongly encouraged that a sketch plan be provided at
least 30 days before a Planning Commission meeting where it will be
discussed.
B. Drawing requirements. Any sketch plan shall be drafted to approximate
scale, shall be clearly labeled as "sketch plan only" and is recommended
to include the following, as applicable:
(1) Boundary line of the development.
(2) Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map:
(a) Existing contour lines and identification of any slopes of 15% to
25%, and greater than 25%.
(b) The locations of watercourses (with any name), natural
springs, ponds, lakes and wetlands.
(c) Rock outcrops, stone fields, sinkholes and topical depressions.
(d) Location of any areas within the one-hundred-year floodplain.
(e) Approximate locations and abbreviated names of soil types,
according to the County Soil Survey (or more detailed
professional study) with identification of those that are alluvial,
hydric, have a depth to bedrock of less than three feet or a
seasonally high water table of less than three feet. If such soils
do not exist, that shall be stated on the plan.
(f) Ridgelines and watershed boundaries.
§ 192-26 SOLID WASTE § 192-27
180:407
(g) Area and location of any proposed common open space, with a
description of the rationale used to locate the open spaces.
(h) If any common open space is proposed; method of ownership
and entity proposed to be responsible for maintenance.
(i) If any common open space is proposed: description of intended
purposes and uses.
(j) Any proposed trails, existing trails and trail easements.
(k) Buildings of historical significance that could be impacted by
the project, with name and description.
(l) Existing and proposed utility easements and restrictive
covenants and easements for purposes which might affect
development (stating which easements and rights-of-way
proposed for dedication to the municipality).
(m) Locations of treelines and existing forested areas, with a
description of the approximate average trunk diameter of the
older trees on the tract (such as "less than 12 inches").
(n) Locations of individual mature trees of greater than 18 inches
in trunk diameter measured at a height of three feet above the
surrounding average ground level, other than trees within
forested areas and treelines (not required for areas that will
not be affected by the proposed plan, if so noted on the plan).
(o) Areas of existing mature woods that are proposed to be
protected and preserved or removed.
(p) An identification of scenic views onto the tract and from the
tract.
(q) Proposed access onto existing streets.
(3) Conceptual proposed lot and street layout with approximate areas
of lots (such as "two acres").
(4) Site data, including:
(a) Acreage of the entire tract.
(b) Number of lots and types of dwelling units (if residential).
(c) Zoning district, including any overlay districts, and applicable
lot area and setback requirements.
(5) North point and scale and a tentative name of the project.
(6) Approximate proposed locations of any nonresidential buildings
and statement of the general proposed types of any nonresidential
uses.
§ 192-27 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-27
180:408
§ 192-28. Sketch plan review procedures.
(7) A map showing the general location of the project in relation to
nearby streets and creeks.
(8) Tentative approximate locations of any stormwater detention
basins, best management practices and stormwater drainage
channels.
(9) For residential developments, whether the applicant proposes to
dedicate recreation land or provide fees in lieu of land, if required.
(10) Note stating the general methods of providing water and sewer
service, including sufficient information to show the general
feasibility of any proposed nonpublic central sewer service.
(11) Names of any adjacent nonresidential uses and any zoning district
boundaries in the area.
(12)Name and address of person responsible for the preparation of the
plan and the date of preparation.
(13) Statement of the proposed uses of the land.
(14) Plans should be of a standard size, such as 18 inches by 24 inches,
and should be a maximum of 24 inches by 36 inches.
C. Overlay. As part of a preliminary plan application, accurate mapping is
required of natural features of the tract. Applicants are encouraged to
submit this same accurate natural feature mapping as part of the sketch
plan. Applicants are also encouraged to show a conceptual sketch of the
proposed development on a transparent overlay over this map of
natural features.
D. Conservation design process. See § 192-33, which requires applicants
for certain subdivisions and land developments to submit maps showing
how their project follows the conservation design process. Applicants
choosing the conservation subdivision option are required to submit
these maps as part of the sketch plan process, to avoid delays to the
applicant in preliminary plan approval. Submittal at the sketch plan
stage will greatly increase the likelihood that all issues will be able to
be resolved in time to meet the standard ninety-day time clock for
approval of a preliminary plan, without needing time extensions.
A. No official action shall be taken on a sketch plan. The Township shall
not be bound by comments made or not made as part of a sketch plan
review.
B. The Township should distribute copies of the sketch plan to the
Township Engineer, the relevant Township staff and the Planning
Commission for advisory reviews.
§ 192-27 SOLID WASTE § 192-28
180:409
C. The sketch plan should be reviewed by the Planning Commission and
the Board of Commissioners, with any comments reported to the
applicant or his/her representative. It is recommended that the
following matters be emphasized in a review of a sketch plan:
(1) The suitability of areas proposed for development and areas
proposed as open space, considering the process of § 192-33.
(2) The most suitable methods of providing street access, including
access points onto existing streets, and possible interconnections
with existing streets or streets within approved developments.
(3) Methods to reduce the total percentage of the site that will be
regraded, paved or deforested.
D. If the sketch plan proposes to include three or more dwelling units, then
a copy of the plan should be provided to the Township Recreation and
Park Board for a review of whether open space or recreation fees
should be required.
E. If the applicant chooses the conservation subdivision option, a field
view at the project site to review the sketch plan with the Planning
Commission is required, unless such requirement is waived by action of
the Planning Commission.
§ 192-28 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-28
180:410
ARTICLE V
Preliminary Plans for Major Subdivisions and Certain Land
Developments
§ 192-29. Initial steps.
§ 192-30. Submission and review procedure.
A. Presubmission consultation. As described in § 192-26, applicants are
encouraged to informally discuss their proposals with applicable
Township staff before preparing engineered plans.
B. Design process. See § 192-33, which requires that applicants for certain
types of applications must show compliance with the specified design
process at the time of a sketch plan, preliminary plan or conditional use
application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to meet this
requirement at the earliest submittal made to the Township.
C. Site tour. Applicants are very strongly encouraged to cooperate in an
on-site tour of the property by Township officials. See the language in
the application form that requests permission for a site tour. This site
tour should be scheduled as soon as possible after the applicant has
provided copies of a map of existing conditions. At best, this would
occur after a sketch plan has been submitted, but before preliminary
plans have been completed.
(1) This site tour is intended to informally:
(a) Familiarize Township officials with the property's existing
features, particularly including scenic views and the site's
relationship to surrounding areas;
(b) Identify potential site design issues that will need to be
addressed; and
(c) Discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of
proposed development and open spaces.
(2) Comments made during the site visit shall not be binding upon the
Township, and no formal action or recommendation shall be made
during the site visit.
D. Sketch plan. Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, applicants
are very strongly encouraged to submit a sketch plan, prepared in
accordance with the requirements of § 192-27. A sketch plan review
often allows an applicant to save substantial time and engineering costs
because many concerns about layout and issues concerning Township
ordinances can be resolved prior to detailed engineering. This can often
reduce the need for future redesign at a more detailed stage, thereby
saving the applicant significant money and time. No official action is
required on a sketch plan, so it will not delay the submittal of a
preliminary plan.
§ 192-29 SOLID WASTE § 192-30
180:411
A. Preliminary plan submission required.
(1) A preliminary plan submission for a major subdivision or land
development (except as provided in Subsection A(2) below)
meeting all of the requirements of this article shall be filed by the
applicant and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
(2) A preliminary plan submission is not required for the following
applications, which instead shall meet the requirements of Article
VII:
(a) A minor subdivision (as defined in Article II); or
(b) A submission that only involves a lot line adjustment (as
defined in Article II) or minor adjustments to a previously
approved plan as specified in § 192-41; or
(c) A land development that involves only one principal
nonresidential building or addition of less than 10,000 square
feet of building floor area on one lot without any additional
dwelling units.
B. Required submission.
(1) The applicant shall file with the Township staff, at least 30 calendar
days prior to a regular Planning Commission meeting; the required
fees and the information and plans required under § 192-31. Any
subsequent submittal of revised plans shall be submitted at least 12
days before a Planning Commission meeting where the plans are
intended to be reviewed, unless permission is granted for a later
submittal by the Township Engineer or Planning Commission,
particularly when a revision only involves minor technical changes
or corrections. These deadlines may be revised by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners.
(2) The staff shall forward applicable plans to the following agencies to
seek their comments prior to preliminary plan approval:
(a) Township Authority or Sewage Enforcement Officer (if
applicable);
(b) Public Safety Department;
(c) The Township Park and Recreation Board (layout, natural
features and grading plan only; if recreation land or common
open space is proposed or if deemed appropriate by the
Township staff);
(d) The Township Planning Commission, with such information
provided prior to or at the first regularly scheduled Planning
Commission meeting after a proper submission; and
§ 192-30 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-30
180:412
(e) The County Planning Commission.
(3) Applicant's distribution. The applicant is fully responsible for the
following:
(a) Contacting the appropriate utility authorities/companies, as
appropriate, including the water supplier;
(b) Seeking at least an informal review by PennDOT of any
proposed access onto a state road, and providing PennDOT
with sufficient information for such a review;
(c) Determining whether any permits or approvals are needed
from any agency outside of the Township, including PaDEP and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
(d) Providing a copy of the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Plan (ESPCP) to the County Conservation District, together
with its required review fees, if any earth disturbance is
proposed, unless the applicant states, in writing, in a signed
letter to the Township that earth disturbance will not occur
until approval of the final plan, in which case the ESPCP may
be submitted at final plan stage;
(e) Providing copies to adjacent municipalities if any portion of a
subdivision or land development is within the boundary of that
municipality;
(f) Providing the County Planning Commission review fees to the
Township with the plan submission;
(g) Providing copies and making submittals to the Township and
review agencies as required under PaDEP's sewage planning
module process, if applicable.
(4) Each preliminary plan and supporting documents should
incorporate any revisions recommended by the Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer and other appropriate
Township Officials during any sketch plan review.
(5) Colored layout plan. It is recommended that the applicant provide
one copy of the layout plan that is colored to highlight major
features such as paving, trees, waterways, streets, wetlands and
building locations to allow clear understanding by the general
public at public meetings.
(6) Revisions. A detailed list of revisions and response to each
comment from a previously submitted plan shall be provided
whenever a revised plan is submitted. The developer's plan
preparer shall certify that the list of revisions is complete.
C. Determination of completeness of the submission.
§ 192-30 SOLID WASTE § 192-30
180:413
(1) Based upon the initial review by the Township staff and/or the
Township Engineer, the Planning Commission shall have authority,
at its first regularly scheduled meeting after the submission is filed
in a timely fashion, to determine that a submission is incomplete
and therefore to refuse to review the submission further and to do
one of the following:
(a) Not accept the submission, indicating deficiencies in writing,
and return the fee (minus the costs of any Township review) to
the applicant.
(b) Accept the submission as being filed for review on the
condition that the applicant shall file such additional required
materials and information to the staff or appropriate agency or
person by a specific deadline.
(c) Table the acceptance of the submission until the next Planning
Commission meeting after the applicant has met all of the
submittal requirements within the required time period prior
to the meeting. The ninety-day time limit for action shall not
begin until the plan is accepted as complete.
(d) Recommend that the plan be rejected by the Board of
Commissioners for just cause, such as the submission being
significantly incomplete.
(2) If the Commission determines that the submission is complete, as
filed and as required, the Commission shall accept the plans and
may begin its review.
(3) Zoning variances and approvals.
(a) Applications for a subdivision or land development shall
comply with the Township Zoning Ordinance, as amended. An
application under the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall not be considered to be complete for the
purposes of starting the state-mandated ninety-day time limit if
one or more zoning variances or special exception or
conditional use zoning approval will be required for the
subdivision or land development to legally occur as submitted,
until such time as the needed zoning variances and approvals
have been granted. During this time, the application may still
be reviewed by the Township.
[1] If a zoning variance or special exception or conditional use
approval is needed for the plan to be completed as
submitted, and such approval has not been granted, then
the Board of Commissioners shall have sufficient grounds
to deny approval of the application under this chapter.
[2] At the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, a
subdivision or land development may be approved
§ 192-30 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-30
180:414
conditioned upon the later approval of a zoning variance,
special exception or conditional use.
(b) A subdivision or land development approval shall not be
delayed because of a court appeal of a zoning variance, special
exception or conditional use that was granted to the developer.
Instead, satisfactory resolution of such appeal shall be a
condition for approval under this chapter. If a developer
appeals a zoning variance, special exception approval or
conditional use approval that was not granted to him/her, then
Subsection C(3)(a) above shall still apply.
D. Review by Township staff.
(1) Review by Township Engineer.
(a) After the plans are duly submitted for review, unless granted
an extension by the Planning Commission or unless the plans
are incomplete, the Township Engineer should review the
engineering considerations of the preliminary plan and
prepare one or more reports on such considerations to the
Planning Commission.
(b) The Township Engineer may make additional reports and
recommendations to the Planning Commission and the Board
of Commissioners during review of the plan.
(c) The applicant and/or his/her engineer shall make reasonable
efforts to resolve technical engineering considerations outside
of and prior to Planning Commission meetings. The Township
Engineer may require the applicant or his/her engineer to meet
with him/her for this purpose.
(d) A copy of findings of the Township Engineer should be sent to
the applicant or his/her representative by the Township staff.
(2) Review by Township Zoning Officer.
(a) After the plans are duly submitted for review, unless granted
an extension by the Planning Commission or unless the plans
are incomplete, the Zoning Officer should review the zoning
considerations of the preliminary plan and prepare one or
more reports on such considerations to the Planning
Commission.
(b) The Zoning Officer may make additional reports and
recommendations to the Planning Commission and the Board
of Commissioners during review of the plan.
(c) The applicant and/or his/her engineer shall make reasonable
efforts to resolve zoning considerations outside of and prior to
Planning Commission meetings. The Zoning Officer may
§ 192-30 SOLID WASTE § 192-30
180:415
require the applicant or his/her engineer to meet with him/her
for this purpose.
(d) A copy of findings of the Zoning Officer should be sent to the
applicant or his/her representative by the Township staff.
E. Review by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission should
accomplish the following within the time limitations of the State
Planning Code (unless the applicant grants a written time extension),
while allowing a sufficient number of days within this deadline for a
decision by the Board of Commissioners.
(1) Review applicable reports received from any official reviewing
agencies.
(2) Provide a recommendation regarding whether the preliminary plan
submission meets the requirements of this chapter and other
applicable ordinances.
(3) Recommend any revisions to the submission that are needed to
comply with this chapter or that would generally improve the plan.
(4) Recommend approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the
preliminary plan submission in a written report to the Board of
Commissioners that should specify any recommended conditions
for approval, identify defects found in the application, describe
requirements which have not been met and cite the provisions of
the ordinance relied upon.
(5) Offer recommendations on waivers and modifications requested by
the applicant.
F. Review and action by Board of Commissioners. The Board of
Commissioners shall:
(1) Review the report of the Planning Commission and any reports that
have been received from reviewing agencies;
(2) Determine whether the preliminary plan submission meets the
requirements of this chapter and other ordinances;
(3) Approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plan
submission within the time limits required by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.137 As of adoption date of this
chapter, this law requires:
(a) The Board of Commissioners to act not later than 90 days
following the date of the first regular meeting of the Planning
Commission held after the preliminary plan has been properly
filed for review, but in no case shall the Board of
Commissioners' decision be made later than 90 days following
137. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. 10101 et seq.
§ 192-30 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-30
180:416
the date the submission was accepted as being filed for review,
unless the applicant grants a written extension of time; and
(b) That no subdivision or land development shall be granted final
approval until a report is received from the County Planning
Commission or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the
application was forwarded to the County Planning
Commission, whichever comes first.
G. Decision by Board of Commissioners.
(1) The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be in writing and
shall be communicated to the applicant or agent for the applicant
personally or by mail or as otherwise allowed by state law at his/her
last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.
(2) Approval of the preliminary plan submission shall constitute
conditional approval of the subdivision or land development as to
the character and intensity, but shall not constitute approval of the
final plan nor authorize the sale of lots or construction of buildings.
(3) If the preliminary plan submission is disapproved, the decision
shall specify defects found in the submission, describe
requirements which have not been met and cite the provisions of
the statute or ordinance relied upon in each case.
(4) At the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, the Board may
waive the requirement to submit a preliminary plan if the
preliminary plan submission also meets all of the requirements of a
final plan submission and the Board determines that there are no
significant outstanding matters regarding the plan.
(5) Acceptance of conditions. If conditions are placed upon an
approval, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant, in writing,
to accept or reject the conditions within a maximum of five days
after the date of receipt of the decision. If the applicant fails to
accept or reject the conditions within such time period, then it shall
be presumed that the applicant has accepted all of the conditions
upon the approval. If the applicant rejects any condition, then the
approval shall be rescinded, unless a decision of a court determines
such condition was not valid.
H. Final plan submission deadline.
(1) An applicant shall file a final plan within five years from the date of
the approval of the preliminary plan by the Board of
Commissioners.
(2) Failure to comply with this requirement shall render the
preliminary plan null and void, and a new preliminary plan
submission and approval shall be required.
I. Development in stages. See § 192-35H.
§ 192-30 SOLID WASTE § 192-31
180:417
§ 192-31. Preliminary plan requirements.
See § 192-30, regarding when a preliminary plan is required.
§ 192-32. Certification.
All certification shall comply with the state professional licensing laws. All
subdivisions of land shall be certified and stamped by a registered land
surveyor. At least one set of all plans provided to the Township, including
revisions, shall bear original signatures and original seals of plan preparers,
and applicant's notarized signature, which shall be marked as a "Township
File Copy."
§ 192-33. Design process.
As part of the submittal of a sketch plan, preliminary plan or conditional
use, whichever comes first, for a major subdivision or land development
that involves over three acres of land for a nonresidential project or six or
more dwelling units for a residential project, the applicant shall provide the
following mapping and demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the
following process was followed in designing the proposed development.
A. All of the following information and materials listed in this section are
required as part of all preliminary plans for any land development and
any major subdivision.
(1) This list of requirements shall serve both:
(a) To establish the requirements; and
(b) As a checklist for the applicant and the Township to use to
ensure completeness of submissions.
(2) The applicant shall submit completed photocopies of the § 192-31D
checklist as part of the application.
B. The required information listed in this section may be combined or
separated onto different sheets, provided that all information is clearly
readable.
C. Deferral of information. See § 192-7C(2), which may allow an applicant
to defer submitting of engineering details from the preliminary to the
final plan stage.
D. Preliminary plan for Major Subdivisions or Land Developments
Checklist and List of Submittal Requirements.138
A. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit these sketches as part of
the sketch plan process to avoid delays to the applicant in preliminary
plan approval. Submittal at the sketch plan stage will greatly increase
the likelihood that all issues will be able to be resolved in time to meet
138. Editor's Note: Said checklist is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 192-31 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-33
180:418
the standard ninety-day time clock for approval of a preliminary plan,
without needing time extensions.
B. This process is intended to demonstrate how the special features of the
property relate to resource areas on adjacent lands and how the
development will properly relate to the features of the land that are
most worthy of conservation. See the Existing Resources and Site
Analysis Map provisions in § 192-31D. Existing conditions shall be
accurately mapped. For the sole purposes of meeting this section, the
mapping of proposed development may be at a sketch plan level of
detail.
(1) Delineation of recreation land and any common open space. Using
the map of Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map, the applicant
shall delineate areas that are proposed to be preserved as
recreation land if required by § 192-60 of this chapter or common
open space if required by the Zoning Ordinance139 and/or otherwise
through conservation easements.
(a) If a conservation subdivision is proposed, then the applicant
shall show compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance, including but not limited to the following:
[1] Providing calculations of the minimum percent and
acreage of required common open space, which shall be
submitted at the sketch plan stage or the preliminary plan
stage, whichever submission occurs first.
[2] Proposed common open space shall be designated using
the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map as a base
map. The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with
applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and
§ 192-60 of this chapter. One-hundred-year floodplains,
wetlands and slopes over 25% shall be shown.
[3] The proposed common open space shall maximize
opportunities to interconnect open spaces with important
natural features and common open space on neighboring
properties. (See the context map in Section 192-31.) The
applicant should consider the mapping of conservation
areas in the Comprehensive Plan, unless or until a more
detailed map is prepared for Lower Allen Township.
[4] In delineating other proposed conservation areas, the
applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on
the tract in terms of their highest to least suitabilities for
inclusion in the proposed common open space in
consultation with the Planning Commission and in
accordance with § 192-60 of this chapter and applicable
sections of the Zoning Ordinance. The highest priority
139. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Zoning.
§ 192-33 SOLID WASTE § 192-33
180:419
shall be given to open space and trails that can link into
existing or approved adjacent public recreation land or
that will preserve stream corridors.
[5] On the basis of those priorities and practical
considerations given to the tract's configuration, its
context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and
neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision
objectives, proposed conservation areas shall be
delineated to meet at least any minimum area percentage
requirements for common open space and in a manner
clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of
resources included within them.
(b) If a conservation subdivision is not proposed, the applicant
shall show measures that will be used to minimize impacts
upon important natural features. The applicant shall show that
every reasonable effort has been made to locate development
to avoid the slopes over 25%, one-hundred-year floodplain and
wetlands and minimize impact upon other important
conservation areas. In addition to meeting any requirement for
common open space, important natural features should also be
protected as part of individual lots (such as large rear yards
and/or through conservation easements).
(2) Potential development areas concept map. Based upon
consideration of the existing features map and the natural features
and conservation areas described above, the potential development
areas shall be mapped. These potential development areas are
areas that are best suited for the majority of the development on
the tract.
(3) Location of home sites. In respect of the natural features and other
conservation areas described above, the approximate proposed
locations of new homes/principal buildings shall then be selected. It
is recognized that on-lot sewage disposal system suitability needs
to influence these choices when on-lot systems are used. Proposed
development shall be carefully located and designed to minimize
impacts upon natural features and other conservation areas.
(a) While the mapping of existing features required by this section
is required to be accurate and to scale, the locations of
proposed home sites, lot lines, roads and trails may be at a
sketch plan level of detail for the purposes of complying with
this section.
(b) The applicant shall provide a written and graphic analysis of
how the proposed development will respect and incorporate
the important resources of the site and be coordinated with
resources, open space/trail corridors and views on surrounding
§ 192-33 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-33
180:420
properties. This may involve an overlay map that shows
important natural features and proposed development.
(4) Layout of streets and trails. A sketch of the tentative street layout
shall then be designed to serve the appropriate building sites.
Trails should also be considered to link together common open
spaces, clusters of homes and other destinations (such as nearby
stores, parks and schools). Building sites should be clustered
together to minimize wetland impacts and the number of stream
crossings by roads. See the proposed trail network on the
Township's Official Map.
(5) Drawing the lot lines. Tentative lot lines should then be drawn on
the site to encompass the proposed building sites, to result in a
development concept plan. Once this sketch is prepared, then more
detailed engineering may be completed.

ARTICLE VII
Minor Subdivisions, Certain Land Developments and Lot Line
Adjustments
§ 192-38. Purpose.
This article provides simplified procedures for submitting and reviewing
minor subdivisions, certain land developments and lot line adjustments.
§ 192-39. Submission and review procedure.
The following submission and review process shall apply for minor
subdivisions, lot line adjustments, annexations, land developments involving
only a single nonresidential building or building addition of less than 10,000
square feet of building floor area with no additional dwelling units, and what
the Township determines to be minor revisions of approved plans under
§ 192-41.
A. Final plan submission required. A final plan submission for each
application under this section shall be filed by the applicant and
reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII. A
preliminary plan is not required for a submittal under this Article VII.
B. Required submission.
(1) The applicant shall file with the Township staff at least 30 calendar
days prior to a regular Planning Commission meeting the required
fees and the information and plans required under this Article VII.
Any subsequent submittal of revised plans shall be submitted at
least 12 days before a Planning Commission meeting where the
plans are intended to be reviewed, unless permission is granted for
a later submittal by the Township Engineer or Planning
Commission. These deadlines may be revised by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners.
(2) If a state road is involved, the applicant shall forward the required
information to PennDOT and apply for a highway occupancy
permit. If such permit is not granted prior to final plan approval,
then it shall automatically be a condition of final plan approval, and
the plans shall not be signed or released for recording by the
Township until the PennDOT permit is granted.
(3) Each final plan filed for minor subdivisions shall provide the
information required by § 192-40. Plans for lot line adjustments
shall provide the information required by § 192-41.
(4) A soil erosion and sediment pollution control plan shall be provided
to the County Conservation District, unless waived by the
Township.
(5) Revisions. A detailed list of revisions and response to each
comment from a previously submitted plan shall be provided
§ 192-38 SOLID WASTE § 192-39
180:431
whenever a revised plan is submitted. The developer's plan
preparer shall certify that the list of revisions is complete.
C. Initial actions by the staff.
(1) The staff shall review the submission items filed against a checklist
for completeness and shall report such review to the Commission at
its next regularly scheduled meeting.
(2) The staff shall retain one file copy of all materials submitted by the
applicant.
(3) The staff shall forward to the Commission at or before the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission at least one copy of
the application form, at least one copy of the final plan checklist,
several copies of the final plan and at least one copy of the
supporting documents.
D. Determination of completeness by Planning Commission.
(1) Based upon the initial review of the Township staff and/or the
Township Engineer, the Planning Commission shall have authority,
at its first regularly scheduled meeting after the submission is filed
in a timely fashion, to determine that a submission is incomplete
and therefore to refuse to review the submission further and to do
one of the following:
(a) Not accept the submission, indicating the deficiencies, and
return the fee (minus the costs of any Township review) to the
applicant.
(b) Accept the submission as being filed for review on the
condition that the applicant shall file such additional required
materials and information to the staff or appropriate agency or
person within a certain number of days from the date of such
acceptance.
(c) Table the acceptance of the submission until the next Planning
Commission meeting where the applicant has met all of the
submittal requirements and has filed such materials within the
required time period prior to the meeting. The ninety-day time
limit for action shall not begin until such acceptance.
(d) Recommend that the plan be rejected by the Board of
Commissioners for just cause.
(2) If the Commission determines that the submission is significantly
complete, as filed and as required, the Commission shall accept the
plans and may begin its review.
(3) Zoning variances and approvals.
§ 192-39 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-39
180:432
(a) Applications for a subdivision or land development shall
comply with the Township Zoning Ordinance,143 as amended.
An application under the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall not be considered to be complete for the
purposes of starting the clock for the state-mandated ninetyday
time limit if one or more zoning variances or special
exception or conditional use zoning approval will be required
for the subdivision or land development to legally occur as
submitted, until such time as the needed zoning variances and
approvals have been granted. During this time, the application
may still be reviewed by the Township.
[1] If a zoning variance or special exception or conditional use
approval is needed and has not be granted, then the Board
of Commissioners shall have sufficient grounds to deny
approval of the application.
[2] At the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, a
subdivision or land development may be approved
conditioned upon the later approval of a zoning variance,
special exception or conditional use.
(b) A subdivision or land development approval shall not be
delayed because of a court appeal of a zoning variance, special
exception or conditional use that was granted to the developer.
Instead, satisfactory resolution of such appeal shall be a
condition for approval under this chapter. If a developer
appeals a zoning variance, special exception approval or
conditional use approval that was not granted to him/her, then
Subsection D(3)(a) above shall still apply.
E. Review by Township staff.
(1) Review by Township Engineer: The Township Engineer shall review
the engineering considerations in the plan and prepare an initial
report on such considerations to the Planning Commission. The
Township Engineer may make additional reports and
recommendations to the Planning Commission and the Board of
Commissioners during review of the plan.
(2) Review by Township Zoning Officer: The Zoning Officer shall
review the zoning considerations in the plan and prepare an initial
report on such considerations to the Planning Commission. The
Zoning Officer may make additional reports and recommendations
to the Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners
during review of the plan.
F. Review by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall
accomplish the following within the time limitations of the Pennsylvania
143. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Zoning.
§ 192-39 SOLID WASTE § 192-39
180:433

agencies and officers;
(2) Determine whether the final plan submission meets the
requirements of this chapter and other applicable ordinances;
(3) Review the final plan submission and recommend some or all
revisions that may be needed to address compliance with this
chapter and other applicable ordinances;
(4) Recommend whether any requested waivers or modifications
should be approved; and
(5) Recommend approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the
final plan submission in an advisory report to the Board of
Commissioners, which may include recommending conditions for
approval or describing requirements which have not been met.
G. Review by Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners shall:
(1) Review the report of the Commission and any reports received from
any other official reviewing agencies;
(2) Determine whether the final plan submission meets the
requirements of this chapter and other applicable ordinances; and
(3) Approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the final plan
submission within the time required by the Municipalities Planning
Code.145 (Note: As of 2008, this law requires the Board of
Commissioners to act not later than 90 days following the date of
the first regular meeting of the Commission held after it has been
duly filed for review, but in no case shall the Board of
Commissioners' decision be made later than 120 days following the
date the submission was accepted as being filed for review, unless
the applicant grants a written extension of time.)
(4) County Planning Commission review. No subdivision or land
development shall be granted final approval until a report is
received from the County Planning Commission or until the
expiration of 30 days from the date the application was forwarded
to the County Planning Commission, whichever shall occur first.
H. Decision by Board of Commissioners.

determination of the Board of Commissioners or the Township
Engineer.
H. Certificates of occupancy and completion of improvements.
(1) A temporary or final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued
and a structure shall not be occupied unless said structure has
access to a street with at least a complete paving base course and
any required curbing installed.
(2) In addition to Subsection H(1) above, no final certificate of

hydrants are fully operational, if applicable.
A. Enforcement of security.
(1) In the event that any improvements that were required have not
been installed as provided in this chapter or the approved final plan
or the development agreement, or in the event of the bankruptcy of
the owner or developer, or in the event the performance security
lapses or will lapse in time before the required improvements are
completed, then the Board of Commissioners is hereby granted the
power to elect to enforce any security posted under this chapter by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
(a) Such remedies may include taking all actions necessary to
ensure improvements are completed without cost to the
Township, including but not limited to:
[1] Seizure of undeveloped lots;
[2] Seizure of escrow funds;
[3] Revocation or suspension of building permits or
suspension of issuance of new building permits;

180:443
§ 192-50. Maintenance guaranty.
(b) Construction without inspection. If required improvements
have been completed without providing the Township Engineer
or his/her representatives with proper opportunity for
inspection, and as a result the Township Engineer cannot
determine whether the improvements were properly
constructed, then the Board of Commissioners may require
that the developer, at the developer's expense, remove,
replace, sample, test or reconstruct such improvements as
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and other
applicable Township standards.
(2) Rate of construction. Failure of a developer to construct streets and
other public improvements reasonably at the same time or prior to
the construction of the buildings served by those streets or public
improvements, and at the same rate in time at which buildings are
completed, shall be a violation of this chapter and a cause for
default of the security.
B. Completion by Township. If the proceeds of such security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections
to all the improvements covered by said security, the Board of
Commissioners may, at its option, install or replace part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and
may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.
C. Proceeds for installation of improvements. The proceeds from use of the
security and/or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
developer shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such security and directly related administrative costs.
A. Maintenance guaranty required. All applicants proposing any
subdivision or land development which provides for dedication of
improvements shall be required to provide a legally binding
maintenance guaranty to the Township prior to acceptance of
dedication of the improvements by the Township. This guaranty may be
part of the security agreement. The Township may also require a
developer to provide a maintenance guaranty for required
improvements that are not dedicated to the Township that are
necessary for the proper functioning of the development.
B. Terms of maintenance guaranty. The maintenance guaranty shall be
acceptable in legal form to the Township Solicitor and in content to the
Board of Commissioners and shall include all of the following:
(1) That the applicant make any repair or reconstruction of any
improvement stipulated in the maintenance agreement which is
specified by the Board of Commissioners, if needed because of
§ 192-49 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-50
180:444
faulty construction, workmanship or materials that occurred prior
to acceptance of such improvement by the Township;
(2) That the applicant guarantee at his/her own cost the proper
operation of the improvements stipulated in the maintenance
agreement, up to a maximum period of 18 months from the date of
dedication; and
(3) That the applicant post financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plan, for a maximum term of 18 months from
the date of completion.
C. Public utilities and authorities. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines,
or other utility facilities and related apparatus or facilities, are to be
installed under the jurisdiction and under the rules and regulations of a
public utility or municipal authority, financial security to assure proper
completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority.
This amount of financial security shall not also be required by the
Township if it is required by such utility or authority.
D. Type of security. The maintenance guaranty shall be secured by the
same form of security as is permitted for the improvements guaranties.
E. Terms. Such maintenance guaranty shall be in the form approved by the
Township Solicitor and Board of Commissioners, payable to the
Township, to guarantee the proper operation and repair of the streets
and other dedicated improvements in the subdivision or land
development for 18 months from the date of completion.
F. Amount. The amount of the maintenance guaranty shall be 15% of the
actual cost of installation of such improvements.
G. Release.
(1) Eighteen months after the date of acceptance of dedication of said
improvements, the Township shall release the maintenance
guaranty to the developer (or party that posted the guaranty if all
improvements are in satisfactory condition, as determined by the
Township Engineer.
(2) If said improvements are not in satisfactory condition, the
maintenance guaranty shall be extended until such time as
improvements are in a satisfactory condition, as determined by the
Township Engineer.

Design Standards and Required Improvements
§ 192-54. Applicability.
§ 192-55. Required improvements.
This article sets forth the design and construction standards for required
improvements, regardless of whether the improvement will be dedicated to
the Township.
§ 192-56. Overall requirements.
A. Minimum requirements. The design standards and improvements
required in this article are the minimum requirements for approval of a
subdivision or land development. Additional or higher-type
improvements may be required in specific cases where the Board of
Commissioners determines such improvements are clearly necessary to
protect the public health and safety.
B. Modifications, waivers and exceptions. See § 192-7 of this chapter.
A. Land shall be suitable for the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
B. Hazardous conditions. Subdivisions or land developments subject to
hazardous conditions (such as open quarries, hazardous or toxic site
pollution, limestone solution channels, unconsolidated fill, floods,
excessive erosion or unsafe water supply) shall not be approved until
the developer has provided or has legally committed to provide
adequate measures to overcome or eliminate the hazards, in the
determination of the Board of Commissioners, to the best of their
knowledge. See also the Township's floodplain requirements. However,
the Township accepts no responsibility to identify hazards or to
guarantee their resolution. See the liability section in Article I.
C. Zoning. All aspects of a proposed subdivision or land development shall
conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance151 and all other Township
ordinances and specifications.
D. Nearby development. A subdivision or land development and its street
pattern shall be coordinated with existing or approved nearby
developments or neighborhoods to help develop the area harmoniously
and to help prevent conflicts between neighboring development.
E. Safety. No subdivision or land development shall occur in such a way
that would significantly threaten the public health and safety, including
hazards of toxic substances, traffic hazards, explosive hazards and fire
hazards.

§ 192-54 SOLID WASTE § 192-56
180:449
§ 192-57. Streets and driveways.
F. Low-impact development. Use of low-impact development (LID)
concepts in design of public and private facilities in all subdivisions and
land developments is encouraged.
A. Street (or road) functional classifications. The terms "street" and "road"
shall have the same meaning. See the classifications in the Township
Comprehensive Plan.
(1) Principal arterial highway or street: a highway/street that provides
the main method of access between the Township and adjacent
municipalities. An arterial highway is typically owned and
maintained by the state and typically has an average daily traffic
exceeding 25,000 vehicles.
(2) Minor arterial street: a street that provides the main method of
access between different portions of the Township. A minor arterial
street is typically owned and maintained by the state and typically
has average daily traffic of between 3,500 and 25,000 vehicles.
(3) Collector street: a street that collects traffic from minor streets and
directs that traffic to arterial streets. A collector street typically is
designed to eventually serve 1,500 to 3,500 vehicles per day.
(4) Local street: This street primarily is designed for local traffic, to
collect traffic from individual lots and minor Township streets and
to carry it to collector streets. A local street typically is designed to
ultimately serve between 400 and 1,500 vehicles per day.
(5) Minor Township street: This street primarily is designed for local
traffic, to collect traffic from individual lots and to carry it to local
and collector streets. A minor Township street typically is designed
to ultimately serve less than 400 vehicles per day.
(6) Alley: An alley is not considered to be a street. An alley is a vehicle
cartway that is located to the rear of a lot that is adjacent to a street
and which has a right-of-way width of 20 feet or less.
B. Right-of-way access management and design.
(1) General. Streets shall be designed so that all motorists, bicyclists,
pedestrians and transit users of all ages and abilities can safely
move along and across the streets.
(2) Access to streets.
(a) All proposed subdivisions and land developments shall have
adequate and safe access to the public street system.
(b) Frontage. Any lot created under this chapter shall have
frontage and access onto either:
§ 192-56 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:450
[1] A public street (which may be required to be improved as
necessary under § 192-57B(2)(h)[2]); or
[2] A private street constructed to the same standards as a
public street and that has a permanent system to ensure
adequate maintenance, except as provided in Subsection
B(2)(e) and (f) below.
(c) Private streets and an existing lot. A preexisting lawful lot of
record that abuts an existing private street that does not meet
Township standards may have access for a single principal use
onto such private street, but no new lot shall be created with
access onto such street, except as provided in Subsection
B(2)(e) and (f) below.
(d) Emergency access. Suitable access for emergency vehicles
shall be provided within all subdivisions and land
developments, including adequate clear width and height, and
including access to reach all principal buildings. Driveways
shall be designed to be accessible to emergency vehicles.
Driveways shall have a ten-foot minimum horizontal clearance,
a twelve-foot minimum vertical clearance and be designed to
support the weight of aerial fire apparatus. A driveway serving
an individual single-family residence and that is less than 100
feet in length is exempt from this subsection.
(e) Existing private street and new lots. An existing private street
may be upgraded to allow the creation of up to two new lots, if
approved by the Board of Commissioners and if the following
conditions are met:
[1] The applicant shall grant a sufficient width of easement
along the street to affected property owners to result in a
total fifty-foot minimum easement width along all street
frontage that is owned by the applicant.
[2] The applicant shall agree to ensure that the private street
will be upgraded prior to occupancy of the new lot(s) with
appropriate stone, tar and chip or bituminous paving to
result in a minimum cartway width of 18 feet from the
driveways of the new lots to a public street.
[3] The owners of the parent lot and any new lots shall be
bound by an agreement to annually contribute towards the
maintenance of the street.
[4] That the street will be suitable for access by emergency
vehicles after any improvements that the applicant may
agree to make.
[5] That the private street is the only reasonable method of
providing access to the property.
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:451
(f) Parking courts. If individual units of an office park, townhouse,
apartment or mobile home park development have vehicular
access onto a private parking court, that parking court is not
required to meet Township construction standards for streets,
provided that:
[1] The parking court and related accessways have vehicular
access onto a public street; and
[2] There is a system to ensure maintenance of the parking
court; and
[3] Parking courts and related accessways shall provide
access for emergency vehicles.
(g) Arterial and collector street frontage. Where a subdivision or
land development abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial or collector street, one or more of the following
methods of layout and site design shall be required:
[1] The use of a service or frontage street, or access only onto
side or interior streets, to collect traffic from numerous
driveways and direct it to a select few number of entrances
to the arterial or collector street; and/or
[2] The minimization of the number and length of driveway
cuts or street intersections onto an arterial or collector
street, which may include requiring the use of shared
driveways between adjacent uses or lots; and/or
[3] The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand
turns onto or off of the arterial or collector street; and/or
[4] The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings
entering directly onto an arterial or collector street. If
there is no alternative to this, each driveway entering onto
an arterial or collector street shall have adequate turnaround
space for vehicles provided within the lot so that
vehicles do not back onto the street.
(h) Street continuations.
[1] Stub streets. Where a subdivision or land development
abuts undeveloped land, a subdivision or land
development shall include one or more extensions of
proposed streets with right-of-way to the boundary line of
the tract to provide for an eventual extension into the
adjacent tract for efficient circulation of traffic throughout
the area.
[2] Widening. Where a subdivision or land development abuts
or contains an existing street, additional right-of-way and
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:452
pavement width and curb construction shall be required
conforming with Table 10.1, Design Standards for Streets.
[3] The Board of Commissioners may approve a fee in lieu of
right-of-way and pavement widening and curb
construction, if proposed by the applicant.
(3) Access drives and driveways.
(a) Construction standards. See § 192-63.
(b) Access; state and Township roads. A state highway occupancy
permit is required for all access onto or work within the rightof-
way of a state road. A Township right-of-way permit shall be
obtained before any vehicle access is allowed from a Township
street.
(c) Driveway slopes. Each lot shall be accessed from a street by a
driveway with a maximum grade of 15% for a single-family
detached dwelling driveway and 10% for any other driveway,
except that:
[1] For a driveway that enters onto an arterial street, the first
20 feet from such right-of-way shall have a maximum slope
of 4%, and the next 80 feet shall have a maximum slope of
7%.
[2] For a driveway that enters onto any other street, the first
20 feet shall have a maximum slope of 7%.
(d) Drainage. The developer shall make adequate provisions to
maintain uninterrupted parallel drainage along a street where
intersected by an access drive or driveway. Access drives and
aisles within parking lots shall be graded and drained to keep
the primary travel lane free of stormwater.
(e) At a minimum, the first 50 feet of a driveway adjacent to a
street cartway shall be hard-surfaced in asphalt, concrete,
paving block or similar surface, not including stones or soil.
(f) The grade of the shoulder of a road shall be maintained along
its length and shall not be filled in to allow the construction of a
driveway at a higher grade.
(g) Shared driveways. Unless otherwise approved, a driveway
shall serve a maximum of two single-family residential lots. A
driveway serving more than one residential lot shall only be
approved if the applicant demonstrates to the Board of
Commissioners that it is needed because of a sight distance
concern or to minimize disturbance of natural features. The
deed of each lot shall include a proper system to ensure proper
maintenance of the driveway. A copy of a recorded joint use
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:453
agreement between affected property owners shall be
provided.
(h) The number of driveways is limited to a maximum of one per
100 feet of public street lot frontage, except for circular
driveways for single-family residential use.
(i) Driveways shall not cross the street right-of-way line:
[1] Within 40 feet of the right-of-way line of an intersecting
street.
[2] Within five feet of a fire hydrant or drainage inlet.
[3] Within five feet of a property line.
(j) Width. Driveway width shall be limited as follows:
[1] Minimum 22 feet at the right-of-way line for
nonresidential, multifamily residential and mobile home
park uses.
[2] Minimum 10 feet and maximum 24 feet at the right-of-way
line for single-family residential uses.
(4) Right-of-way occupancy.
(a) Structures, facilities or improvements that are placed within a
state road right-of-way shall require a highway occupancy
permit from PennDOT.
(b) Structures, facilities or improvements that are placed within a
Township road right-of-way shall comply with the Township
Right-of-Way ordinance and the Streets and Sidewalk
Ordinance.152
(c) Installation of structures, facilities or improvements within an
area that is planned to be dedicated to the Township as a public
street right-of-way shall follow the same procedures as for
streets that are currently dedicated as public streets.
(5) Work within the right-of-way. Construction within a state road
right-of-way shall require a highway occupancy permit from
PennDOT. Construction within a Township road right-of-way shall
comply with the Township Right-of-Way Ordinance.
C. Street design standards.
(1) Right-of-way, cartway width and other standards. Minimum street
design standards shall be as shown in Table 10.1, unless PennDOT
establishes a more restrictive requirement along a state road.

NOTES:
(1) Varies depending on typical section selected.
(2) Five miles per hour greater than planned posted speed limit.
(3) Specific project design, in accordance with PennDOT design
criteria.
(4) Specific project design, in accordance with transportation
impact study recommendations.
(a) For one-way loop streets, see under culs-de-sac in
§ 192-57C(5).
(b) Rear or side alleys, where approved, shall have a minimum
cartway width of 14 feet for two-way traffic and 10 feet for oneway
traffic.
(c) All approaches to an intersection of two or more streets shall
have a leveling area not greater than 4% grade for a minimum
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way
line of the intersecting street.
(d) The minimum grade of any street center line or gutter shall be
1%.
(e) Any development of 25 or more dwelling units shall have at
least two means of vehicle access into the development. The
second means of access may be limited to emergency vehicles,
provided the applicant demonstrates the access will be
properly designed and maintained for its intended purpose.
(f) Adjacent to fire hydrants, the minimum pavement width shall
be 26 feet, without parking, for a minimum length of 40 feet.
(g) Streets may be designed with parking spaces located in lay-by
or cut-out lanes that reduce the width of the cartway along
portions of a street where on-street parking is prohibited.
Portions of streets near intersections may be designed with
bump-outs that reduce the width of street that needs to be
crossed by pedestrians. In such cases, adequate width for
bicycle traffic shall be continued through the intersection.
(2) Street construction standards. Section 192-63 shall apply.
(a) Streets and alleys shall be graded, improved and surfaced to
the grades and dimensions shown on plans, profiles and crosssections
submitted by the developer and as approved by the
Board of Commissioners and shall meet applicable Township
standards.
(b) Street pavement type and depth shall be determined for each
plan according to a pavement design prepared by a
professional engineer in accordance with PennDOT
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:456
procedures. In no case shall the pavement type or depth be
less than the minimum in the Township's street construction
standards.
(3) Horizontal geometry. Horizontal curves shall connect all tangent
street lines. A minimum tangent of 100 feet, measured from edge of
cartway, shall be required between a curve and a street
intersection where one of the intersecting streets is a collector or
an arterial street.
(4) Vertical geometry. The provisions of Table 10.1 above shall apply,
including sight distance requirements along the street and
maximum grades for streets. Vertical curves shall be used at all
changes of grade. The length of the vertical curve shall be
determined by the required site distance specified in Table 10.1.
(5) Cul-de-sac streets. A maximum of 10% of street length in any
subdivision may be cul-de-sac streets. Culs-de-sac will only be
permitted in locations where the applicant demonstrates that it is
not feasible to develop the parcel without culs-de-sac.
(a) Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted with a maximum length of
800 feet. This distance may be extended to a maximum length
of 1,500 feet if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Board of Commissioners that an acceptable emergency
access drive will be provided at a Township-approved location
to provide a second access point to the end of the cul-de-sac
street. A cul-de-sac street shall have a minimum length of 250
feet. Cul-de-sac streets must be provided with a turnaround
with a minimum paved radius of 40 feet to the face of the
outside curb and a minimum radius of 50 feet to the legal rightof-
way.
(b) The circular right-of-way of the cul-de-sac shall maintain a
minimum ten-foot width between the edge of paving and the
edge of the right-of-way. The circular paving of the cul-de-sac
shall be connected to the approach paving by an arc having a
radius of not less than 50 feet.
(c) The Board of Commissioners may permit acceptable
alternative turnaround designs, including turnarounds of
acceptable radii incorporated into a parking court or a
landscaped island within a cul-de-sac or a one-way loop street.
[1] The turnaround shall have a sufficient radius to allow
movement by school buses, snow plows and emergency
vehicles, even if a vehicle is legally parked along the side
of the cartway.
[2] If a landscaped island is used, it shall be planted in a
manner that will require minimal maintenance and shall
include a system to provide maintenance that is acceptable
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:457
to the Township. The island should be designed to collect
stormwater runoff from the pavement. This includes
design as a rain garden, including well-drained rain
garden soils, and plantings that are tolerant of rain garden
conditions and road salt.
[3] If a one-way loop street is used, it shall not require one
way traffic for more than 500 feet of road length, and shall
have a minimum paved width of 14 feet.
[4] If the street will be dedicated to the Township, the
alternative turnaround must be approved by PennDOT as
qualifying for disbursement of liquid fuels allocation to the
Township.
(d) No street shall dead-end without an approved turnaround at
the end of the street. Temporary stub streets shall be required
to include at least a temporary cul-de-sac if the stub would be
longer than 150 feet or serve more than three dwellings or lots.
(e) The maximum cross slope on the circular part of a cul-de-sac
shall be 5%. The minimum slope of any pavement within the
cul-de-sac shall be 2%.
(f) A cul-de-sac street shall serve a maximum of 20 dwelling units,
except that 30 dwelling units shall be allowed for a
conservation subdivision development.
(g) A snow storage easement shall be established at the end of the
cul-de-sac, which shall provide for proper drainage as the snow
melts. This easement shall be located so that a snow plow can
push snow relatively straight from the street to the far end of
the cul-de-sac. This snow storage easement shall be located
clear of any driveways.
(h) For a temporary cul-de-sac, see § 192-63A(4).
(i) No more than 25% of the outer edge of paving of the circular
portion of a cul-de-sac shall include driveway entrances.
(6) Intersections.
(a) The center lines of streets shall intersect at right angles except
where the developer demonstrates to the Board of
Commissioners that a right angle intersection is not feasible. In
such case, the intersection shall be at as nearly a right angle as
possible, with an absolute minimum angle of 75°. This
requirement for right angles shall not apply for one-way
streets, where the angle of the intersection is conducive for
one-way traffic.
(b) Alignment of street intersections.
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:458
[1] No more than two streets shall intersect at one point.
[2] Where a proposed street or business driveway intersects
an existing cross street, such proposed street or business
driveway shall be aligned with any street intersecting on
the other side of the cross street, unless the Board of
Commissioners or PennDOT determines that such
alignment is not reasonable or feasible.
[3] Offsetting of streets.
[a] If a proposed street cannot intersect at the same
location as a street on the other side of the cross
street, then the proposed street shall be offset by the
following minimum distances from the nearest
intersection of streets:
[i] One hundred fifty feet along a local street;
[ii] Four hundred feet along a collector street; and
[iii] One thousand feet along an arterial street.
[b] Measurement. The minimum distances of this
subsection shall be measured between the points
where the center lines of the rights-of-way of the
intersecting streets intersect with the center line of
the cross street.
(c) At street intersections, lot lines shall be rounded by arcs with
the radii listed below. For arterial streets, the Board of
Commissioners may require a larger radius than stated below,
if recommended by the Township Engineer. A smaller radius
may also be approved under § 192-7.

(7) Boulevard entrance. A new street may utilize a boulevard style of
entrance to another street. In such case, the cartway width of the
travel lane on each side of a median shall be a minimum of 14 feet if
no parking is allowed and 20 feet if on-street parking is allowed.
Each side shall handle one-way traffic and include one-way signs.
The center median shall be landscaped with trees and other
attractive vegetation that will not inhibit sight distances. An
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:459
appropriate method for maintenance of the median shall be
established.
(8) Curbs. Curbs built to Township specifications shall be required on
each side of all streets. Proposed curbs shall be extended to
connect to existing sidewalks if existing curbs are within 150 feet of
the proposed development.
(9) Sidewalks. Sidewalks built to Township specifications shall be
required along all street frontages.
(a) Proposed sidewalks shall be extended to connect to existing
sidewalks if existing sidewalks are within 150 feet of the
proposed development.
(b) The Board of Commissioners may approve a fee in lieu of
sidewalk construction, if proposed by the applicant.
(c) Where the longitudinal slope of sidewalk meets or exceeds 5%,
a level landing area five feet by five feet shall be provided at
intervals of 100 feet.
(10) Guide rails. Streets shall be designed with geometric features that
minimize the need for guide rails. Guide rails shall only be installed
where the result of striking an object or leaving the roadway would
be more severe than the consequence of striking the guide rail.
Guide rails shall be installed by the developer, where necessary, to
meet the guide rail standards in the PennDOT Design Manual, Part
2. Guide rails shall meet the construction standards of PennDOT
Publication 408 and PennDOT Standards for Roadway
Construction.
(11) Streets and topography. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land to produce usable lots and reasonably sloped
streets. See the steep slope regulations in the Zoning Ordinance.153
(12) Drainage. Chapter 184, the Stormwater Management Ordinance,
shall apply.
(a) Street drainage shall not be permitted to cross intersections or
the center line of a road.
(b) Pavement base drains are required on all streets and shall be
provided with a suitable outlet.
(13) Required traffic improvements.
(a) Purpose. In recognition of Sections 503(2)(ii) and 503(3) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,154 this section is
primarily intended to ensure that streets bordering a
153. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Zoning.
154. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. 10101 et seq.
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:460
subdivision or land development are coordinated and of such
widths and grades and in such locations as deemed necessary
to accommodate future traffic and to facilitate fire protection
and to ensure that the access into and out of subdivisions and
land developments is sufficiently safe.
(b) Process. This subsection shall be carried out through
determinations of the Board of Commissioners, after
considering any recommendations of the Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer, the applicant, the
applicant's professional representatives, any comments from
PennDOT that may be provided regarding a state road and any
professional traffic studies that may have been submitted.
(c) On-site/abutting traffic improvements.
[1] Widening of abutting roads. An applicant for any land
development or subdivision shall be required to pave any
existing unpaved street and widen the cartway and any
shoulders, and construct curb and fill-in paving of abutting
streets to Township standards in accordance with Table
10.1. A wider width may be required where needed along a
collector or arterial street.
[2] Such improvements and right-of-way shall be required
unless PennDOT specifically refuses, in writing, to allow
such improvement to a state road, in which case the
Township may still require that abutting right-of-way be
dedicated to the Township or reserved for future
dedication.
[3] Any improvement to a state road shall meet all PennDOT
standards.
(d) Types of required traffic improvements.
[1] The following shall be the definition of "on-site
improvement" (unless this definition is amended by state
law): all street improvements constructed on the
applicant's property, or the improvements constructed on
the property abutting the applicant's property necessary
for the ingress or egress to the applicant's property.
[2] On-site improvements may include, but are not limited to,
new or upgraded traffic signals, land dedication to
improve abutting intersections, realignment of abutting
curves in a road or the widening of the abutting cartway
and right-of-way.
(e) Funding. In place of completing a required street improvement
as a condition of final approval, an applicant may enter into a
legally binding development agreement with the Township for
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:461
the applicant to fund the improvement, or his/her fair share
of such improvement, as determined by the Board of
Commissioners.
(f) Accounting. Any such funds shall be placed in escrow until
such time as sufficient funds are available for a more
comprehensive improvement, with interest being used towards
the cost of the improvement. Any such funds received under
this subsection shall be accounted for separately.
(g) Phasing. Any completion or funding of a required improvement
may occur in phases in relationship to the phases of the
development, if so stated in a legally binding development
agreement and/or as a condition of final plan approval.
(14) Minimum sight distance.
(a) Sight distances.
[1] An applicant for access for a new street, accessway or
driveway onto a Township street shall demonstrate that
the new access would meet the same PennDOT sight
distance requirements as if the street was a state road.
See Section 441.8 of PennDOT highway occupancy
regulations, or its successor sections.
[2] If the applicant demonstrates to the Township that it is not
possible to meet the desirable sight distances that are
stated in PennDOT regulations, then the intersection shall
be located at the point of maximum sight distances that
are achievable within the street length of the property and
shall meet the minimum required safe sight distances set
forth in such PennDOT regulations.
[3] In the event that the applicant demonstrates to the
Township that the minimum required safe sight distances
cannot be met, then the Board of Commissioners may
require one or more of the following:
[a] That the intersection be located at the point where
maximum sight distance can be achieved;
[b] Restricting turning movements into or out of the
intersection (such as no left turns into or out of the
intersection);
[c] The installation of a right turn acceleration or
deceleration lane;
[d] The installation of a left turn standby lane;
[e] That the horizontal or vertical alignment of the street
be altered;
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:462
[f] An alternative form of access, such as a shared
driveway with another lot, or access onto a different
street; and/or
[g] Denying approval of the plan on the grounds that the
minimum safe distance requirement cannot be met
and that therefore public safety cannot be adequately
protected, and/or that any restrictions on turning
movements would not be practical or would have
adverse impacts upon other properties and streets
that may be used for turnarounds.
[4] In the event that turning movements from an intersection
are to be restricted, the applicant shall provide a detailed
design of the proposed intersection and an engineering
analysis of the anticipated impacts resulting from such
restricted turning movements. The design and analysis
shall be prepared by a professional engineer with
expertise in traffic engineering and shall address the
following:
[a] The impacts on other lots and streets within the
vicinity that may be used by motorists for
turnarounds.
[b] The impacts on public safety, considering sight
distance and types of vehicles.
[c] The provision of appropriate methods to ensure
compliance with the turning restrictions, such as
channelization, alignment, and signage. Such methods
should be certified as complying with applicable
standards of PennDOT or AASHTO.
(15) Maintenance. As a condition for final plan approval, the developer
must enter into a legally binding agreement which shall state who
is to be responsible for the improvement and maintenance of any
street not offered for dedication. If an association of lot owners is to
be made responsible, such association must be legally organized
prior to plan approval by an agreement approved by the Township.
The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to decide
whether to accept an existing or proposed street as a Townshipmaintained
public street.
D. Traffic design standards.
(1) Transportation impact studies.
(a) Purposes: to enable the Township to assess the impact of a
proposed development on the transportation system; to ensure
that proposed developments do not adversely affect the
transportation network; to identify any transportation
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:463
problems associated with access from the site to the existing
transportation network; to delineate solutions to potential
problems and propose improvements to be incorporated into
the proposed development.
(b) Applicability.
[1] A transportation impact study shall be required for any
subdivision or land development that at build-out after
completion of all phases is projected to generate 500 or
more average daily trip ends. "Trip ends" shall mean the
total number of trips both entering and exiting the
proposed development. These projected trip ends shall be
based on the latest edition of the publication titled "Trip
Generation," published by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers, or upon traffic studies conducted within the
last five years at comparable developments.
[2] If a development is proposed to be submitted in phases,
the initial study shall consider a reasonable estimate of the
likely development in later phases, in addition to the
current phase.
[3] The boundaries of the study area to be analyzed shall
include those existing and proposed streets and
intersections which may be affected by the proposed
subdivision or land development. If there is any dispute as
to whether existing and proposed streets and intersections
may be affected or not, the final discretion shall rest with
the Township Engineer or Traffic Engineer designated by
the Township.
[4] In lieu of submitting a transportation impact study, under
the provisions of § 192-7, the Board of Commissioners may
approve a modification to accept a fee from an applicant to
be put towards the cost of a larger, more comprehensive
traffic study.
[5] Where the word "traffic" is used in this section, it shall
include vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles and transit.
(c) Transportation impact study contents. In addition to the
following, a transportation impact study shall generally follow
PennDOT Publication 46, Chapter 11, "Traffic Studies,"
PennDOT Publication 282, "Highway Occupancy Permit
Handbook," and PennDOT Policies and Procedures for
Transportation Impact Studies, 1-28-2009, as amended:
[1] Site description. This section shall include the location,
proposed land uses, acreage, construction staging and
completion date of the proposed land development. Types
of dwelling units and number of bedrooms shall be
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:464
included for residential developments, and gross and
usable floor area for nonresidential developments. A brief
description of surrounding land uses and other proposed
land developments within the study area shall be provided.
A study area map should also be included.
[2] Transportation facilities description.
[a] The study shall describe the proposed internal
transportation system, including vehicular, bicycle,
bus and pedestrian circulation, all internal roadway
widths and rights-of-way, parking conditions, traffic
channelizations and any traffic controls within the
site.
[b] The study shall describe location and design of
proposed access for vehicles, pedestrians and
bicycles, including sight distance limitations and
distance from adjacent driveways and intersections.
[c] The report shall describe the external roadway system
within the study area. Major intersections in the study
area shall be identified and mapped. Any proposal for
bus or van service shall be described. Pedestrian and
bicycle facilities on abutting properties and roads
shall also be documented. All proposed or approved
roadway improvements within the study area shall be
noted.
[3] Existing traffic conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall
be documented for all streets and intersections in the
study area. Traffic volumes shall be recorded for existing
average daily traffic, existing peak hour traffic and for
traffic during the development's peak hour. Complete
traffic counts at all intersections in the study area shall be
conducted, encompassing the peak hours of the
development and roadway. A volume capacity analysis
using the procedures of the current Highway Capacity
Manual and based upon existing volumes shall be
performed during the peak hour(s) of the development for
the peak hour(s) of all roadways and major intersections in
the study area. Levels of service shall be determined for
each location.
[4] Traffic impact of the development. Estimation of traffic
trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for the
peak hour(s) of both the street system and the
development. Acceptable source(s) and methodology shall
be followed. These generated volumes shall be distributed
to the study area and assigned to the existing streets and
intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of
§ 192-57 SOLID WASTE § 192-57
180:465
all assumptions used in the distribution and assignment
phase shall be provided. Traffic volumes shall be assigned
to all access points. Safety issues for any pedestrian
crossings shall be described. Any characteristics of the site
that will cause unusual trip generation rates and/or traffic
flows shall be noted.
[5] Analysis of traffic impact. The total future traffic demand
based on full occupancy of the proposed subdivision or
land development shall be calculated for the existing and
proposed streets and intersections. This demand shall
consist of the combination of the existing traffic expanded
to the completion year through the use of an accepted
background growth rate, the development-generated
traffic and the traffic generated by other proposed
developments in the study area. A volume/capacity
analysis shall also be conducted using the total future
demand and the future roadway capacity. This analysis
shall be performed using the peak hour(s) for all streets
and major intersections in the study area and for the peak
hour(s) of the development. Volume capacity calculations
shall be completed for all movements at major
intersections. Levels of service for all streets and
intersections shall be listed.
[6] Conclusions and recommended improvements.
[a] Any movements on streets and intersections within
the study area showing a Level of Service D, or worse,
based on the latest edition of the Highway Capacity
Manual, shall be considered deficient. Specific
recommendations for the elimination of these
problems shall be listed. For unsignalized
intersections where the traffic impact of the
development causes the side street approach to
degrade to a Level of Service D or lower, the
intersection shall be evaluated for a signal warrant.
Highway capacity evaluations shall consider not only
the overall intersection level of service, but also each
approach and movement to identify any substandard
values which need to be improved.
[b] For all locations where the level of service for the
completion year of the development is deficient
without the proposed development, the study shall
determine improvements which would provide a level
of service and delay no worse than conditions without
the subject development. These improvements may
include street and intersection design and
improvements, traffic signal installation and
operation, traffic signal timing and other
§ 192-57 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-57
180:466
improvements. The study shall also provide an
analysis to determine improvements which would
eliminate all deficient levels of service.
[c] Actions to facilitate use of bus or van service shall be
included, if applicable.
[d] The listing of recommended improvements for both
streets and transit shall include, for each
improvement, the party responsible for the
improvement, a preliminary cost estimate and funding
of the improvement and the phase of development
during which the improvement is proposed to be
completed. Any roadway improvement which requires
increased right-of-way shall be identified.
Recommended improvements shall address all modes
of traffic.
[e] The transportation impact study may be used as a
basis for a Township requirement under § 192-63 or
another section of this chapter.
[f] Improvement plans shall not be submitted to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) before they are submitted to the Township.
Approval of a site access plan by PennDOT does not
guarantee approval by the Township.
[7] Preparation and review. The preparer of the transportation
impact study shall be a professional engineer or
transportation planner. The developer shall reimburse the
Township for reasonable fees and expenses incurred by
the Township Engineer or Traffic Engineer for the review
of the developer's transportation impact study and plans.
(2) Traffic control devices. See § 192-63B. Traffic control devices
warranted by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) or PennDOT Publication 212, "Official Traffic Control
Devices," must be incorporated in the plan. This includes but is not
limited to signs, pavement markings, traffic signals and
delineators.
(3) Work zone traffic control. See the right-of-way provisions of the
Lower Allen Township Code.155

(b) The subdivider shall provide and install street signs meeting
Township requirements or reimburse the costs to the Township
of providing and installing such signs.
(5) Traffic calming. Traffic-calming features may be incorporated in
subdivisions and land developments, in accordance with PennDOTrecommended
procedures and recognized industry standards.
A. Where landscaping is required, a landscape plan for the entire
development shall be prepared by a registered professional competent
in landscape design.
B. See § 192-63D for landscape construction standards.
C. Street trees. Within and abutting all land developments and major
subdivisions, along any existing or proposed street or any access drive
serving more than one nonresidential use or any access drive serving
five or more dwelling units, street trees are required to be planted.
However, street trees shall not be required where the Township
determines that existing healthy trees proposed to be preserved will
serve the same function.
(1) The Board of Commissioners may approve other species of trees
than those listed below if the applicant demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Commissioners that the trees would be sturdy,
attractive, resistant to disease and road salt, and appropriate for
the proposed planting location.

(d) Planting conditions are considered hierarchical. If a tree is
acceptable to plant within Condition A, it is also acceptable for
planting within Condition B or C. However, consideration
should be given for the creation of canopy and shade.
(3) In certain cases where evergreen trees would provide a buffer
between a street and dwellings, or be more consistent with native
vegetation, then the Township may permit the planting of
evergreen trees instead of deciduous trees. In such case, the trees
are intended to be planted immediately outside of the right-of-way.
(4) Quality of trees.
(a) Trees shall be of symmetrical growth, free of insect pests and
disease and durable under the maintenance contemplated.
§ 192-58 SOLID WASTE § 192-58

(b) Trees which have died or have become diseased or pest-ridden
within 18 months from the time of planting shall be replaced by
the developer.
(c) Trees shall generally meet the quality standards of the
American Nursery and Landscape Association's American
Standard for Nursery Stock ANSI, Z60.1, as amended.
(5) Required number and spacing of street trees.
(a) Along streets and access drives where street trees are
required, an average of one street tree shall be required for
every 50 feet of distance along the street right-of-way line on
each affected side of the street. Where a right-of-way does not
exist, an average of one street tree shall be required for every
50 feet of length of cartway on each side of the cartway.
(b) Spacing. The trees required under this section shall be spaced
throughout the development along the street, but are not
required to be planted at exact intervals and may be clustered
following an approved plan. Trees shall be located so that they
do not restrict sight distance at driveway and street
intersections.
(c) If more than 10 trees are required to be planted, then no more
than 50% shall be of one species.
(6) Location of street trees. The trunks of required street trees shall be
planted within a street right-of-way, unless an alternative location
is specifically approved by the Township or required by PennDOT.
Where trees are not allowed within the right-of-way, they shall be
planted on the immediate outside of the right-of-way. Where trees
are not allowed because of a sight distance issue, the trees shall be
planted at other locations on the tract. Street trees, when planted,
shall be, at a minimum, three feet from any established curbline or
eight feet from the cartway if there will be no curbing.
(7) Other requirements. The street trees required under this section
shall be in addition to any trees required under other Township
regulations.
D. Buffer yards. See the requirements for buffer yards in the Township
Zoning Ordinance.156
(1) Rear yard buffers along major streets.
(a) Any residential lot of less than two acres with a rear yard
directly abutting a collector or arterial street or limited access
highway shall, along such rear yard, include a ten-foot-wide
planting strip along the back of the lot, in addition to the

180:472
minimum yard requirement, with vehicle access across this
strip clearly prohibited on notes on any approved plan.
(b) In addition to any street trees required by § 192-58C of this
chapter, this planting strip shall include evergreen plantings
meeting the buffer yard requirements of the Township Zoning
Ordinance or alternative landscaping approved by the Board of
Commissioners. American Arborvitae and similar weak-stem
plants shall not be used.
(c) Any fencing in the rear of such lots shall be placed on the
inside of such plantings. Such plantings shall be placed so that
they do not obstruct safe sight distance.
E. Parking lot landscaping. See the requirements in the Township Zoning
Ordinance.157
(1) Landscaping in parking lots shall be installed in accordance with
landscape construction standards, § 192-63D.

creeks by high temperature runoff, maintain the attractive
character of residential areas and conserve energy.
(2) See definition of "forestry" and the standards for forestry and
woodland preservation in the Zoning Ordinance.159
(3) Tree cutting. The number of trees with a trunk diameter of 2 1/2
inches or more measured at a height of 4.5 feet above the average
surrounding ground height that are cut down or effectively killed as
part of a subdivision or land development in preparation to or as a
result of such activity shall only be:
(a) As approved under the Township Zoning Ordinance as a
forestry operation or under the woodland preservation
provisions; and/or
(b) For the routine thinning of woods.
(4) Protection of trees during construction.
(a) Reasonable efforts shall be taken during any construction to
ensure the protection of trees protected by this section to
ensure that the trees are not accidentally injured or killed.
These efforts shall ensure that equipment does not damage
tree trunks, that roots are not compacted by vehicles and that
the grade level around trees is not changed by more than two
inches. Protective fences must be placed around the outside of
the drip line of protected trees during construction.
(b) If an approved subdivision or land development plan states
that certain trees are to be preserved, and if those trees are
killed, then the developer shall be required to replace those
trees with new mature trees at a ratio of three new trees to one
removed tree, in addition to any other penalties provided in
this chapter.
A. Lots.
(1) Zoning. All lots shall conform to all requirements of the Township
Zoning Ordinance,160 as were in effect at the time such subdivision
plan was duly submitted.
(2) Street frontage. All lots shall front on a public street or on a private

§ 192-58 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-59
180:474
(4) Side lot lines shall abut and be approximately at right angles to
straight streets and on radial lines to curved streets. Pointed or
very irregularly shaped lots shall be avoided.
(5) Lots abutting two streets on two noncontiguous sides shall
ordinarily not be created except as needed to avoid direct vehicular
access onto an arterial or collector street by individual driveways.
This shall not apply to a lot abutting a limited access highway.
(6) A lot, other than preserved common open space, that would not be
suitable for uses permitted in that zoning district shall not be
created as part of a subdivision, but instead shall be incorporated
into another lot.
B. Blocks.
(1) Maximum length. Residential blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in
length in subdivisions using an average lot size of one acre or
larger and shall not exceed 800 feet in length in subdivisions
having an average lot size less than one acre.
(a) Pedestrian and bicycle crossings. Pedestrian and bicycle
access easements shall be provided to allow pedestrian and
bicycle access where street connections are not available to
serve the same purpose. Any block exceeding 600 feet in
length shall have a midblock pedestrian and bicycle access
between streets.
(b) Future street. Blocks shall be considered to be separated by
the reservation as part of an approved subdivision plan of a
fifty-foot minimum right-of-way reserved for a future crossstreet,
such as a street intended to serve future interior lots.
Such future street is not required to be constructed until such
time as the lots fronting on it are subdivided. Such right-of-way
shall be retained in the same ownership as the abutting
interior lot(s) until a street may be developed.
(2) Minimum length. Residential blocks shall have a minimum length
of 250 feet.
(3) Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots, except
where access is limited by virtue of an adjoining arterial street or
by virtue of topographic limitations.
C. Off-street parking, access and loading. See also the Township Zoning
Ordinance.161
(1) Interconnected parking lots. The following provisions shall apply
adjacent to a collector or arterial street where two lots that are
161. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Zoning.
§ 192-59 SOLID WASTE § 192-59
180:475
each intended for current or future uses other than single-family
residences will be contiguous to each other.
(a) When two contiguous uses or lots are in common ownership at
the time of subdivision or land development application, the
parking lots shall include an interconnection to allow vehicles
and pedestrians to travel from one use or lot to another use or
lot without needing to re-enter a public street.
(b) Where two contiguous lots involving current or future uses
other than single-family residences are not in common
ownership, the applicant for a subdivision or land development
shall seek permission from the abutting lot owner to allow a
vehicle interconnection between the parking lots. Unless the
abutting property owner refuses to permit the interconnection,
the subdivision or land development shall include the
construction of a vehicle and pedestrian interconnection
between the parking areas. If the abutting property owner
refuses to permit the interconnection or the interconnection is
currently not feasible, the Board of Commissioners may
require that the subdivision or land development include an
easement allowing a future interconnection and/or construct
the interconnection as a stub up to the applicant's property
line.
(c) Where an interconnection is required or planned between two
uses or lots, the subdivision or land development shall include
a suitable cross-easement that permits vehicles and
pedestrians from one use or lot to have access through the
parking lot and driveway of the adjacent use or lot.
(2) Each parking space adjacent to an island at the end of a parking
row shall have an additional two feet of paving provided in addition
to the required parking space width to allow access to the vehicle.
(3) Developments other than single-family residential shall comply
with the applicable sections of the International Fire Code
regarding access.
D. Trail design standards. See also trail construction standards.
(1) If deemed necessary for the convenient and safe circulation of
bicycles and pedestrians, subdivisions and land developments shall
include the construction of paved trails.
(2) A paved trail shall have a minimum width of five feet and a
maximum width of 12 feet and shall be paved to Township
standards. It may be required to be placed within a street right-ofway
in place of a sidewalk or may be placed elsewhere on a lot
within an easement or other right-of-way.
§ 192-59 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-59
180:476
(3) A trail shall be required from the end of any cul-de-sac street to the
nearest cul-de-sac street or other street in each direction. A trail
shall also be required from the end of any cul-de-sac street or any
other street to provide a connection with adjacent undeveloped
land that can be extended onto that land when it is developed in the
future.
(4) Appropriate signs shall be included at locations where trails
intersect with streets, driveways, sidewalks or other trails.
(5) Trails shall generally be designed in accordance with Designing
Sidewalks and Trails, U.S. Department of Transportation,
September 2001, or as revised.
E. Natural and historic feature preservation and maintenance.
(1) Substantial and sensitive natural features and historic structures
and important archeological sites worthy of protection shall be
respected, incorporated into the design of and reasonably
protected in any subdivision or land development.
(2) These features include, but are not limited to, natural drainage
channels, waterways and falls, large trees, mature groves of trees,
highly scenic views and important community landmarks.
(3) Stream maintenance and access easements.
(a) A stream maintenance easement with a minimum width of 25
feet from the top of bank shall be provided along the Yellow
Breeches Creek and Cedar Run.

conveniently located refuse collection facilities for the residents. All
uses within nonresidential land developments and subdivisions shall
include appropriate refuse collection facilities. All bulk refuse collection
refuse facilities shall be screened by walls or evergreen landscaping
from view of existing dwellings, adjacent undeveloped residentially
zoned lots and public streets.
G. Lot width modifications; flag lot within a conservation subdivision.
(1) Lot width modifications. The minimum lot width requirement as
measured at the minimum building setback line for a lot may be
reduced by the following amounts in the following situations:
(a) Along the curve of a cul-de-sac bulb, the minimum lot width
may be 60% of what would otherwise be required.
§ 192-59 SOLID WASTE § 192-59
180:477
(b) Along the outside of a curve in a street, the minimum lot width
may be 80% of what would otherwise be required.
(c) Where a minimum front yard building setback is less than 50
feet, the minimum lot width may be measured at the proposed
building setback or at a fifty-foot yard setback, whichever is
less.
(2) Flag lot definition. See the Zoning Ordinance.162
(3) Flag lot standards. A flag lot shall only be approved if it will be
within a conservation subdivision development and meets all of the
following standards:
(a) A flag lot shall only be approved as a condition of the
preliminary or final subdivision approval.
(b) A flag lot shall only be approved if the applicant demonstrates
that the flag lot:
[1] Is necessary to minimize the environmental impacts such
as grading and removal of woods that would otherwise
occur; and
[2] Would not result in a greater number of lots on the tract
than would otherwise be feasible and allowed.
(c) A flag lot shall meet the minimum lot width requirement stated
in the Zoning Ordinance as measured at the proposed front
yard building setback line, as opposed to the minimum front
yard building setback line.
(d) The pole portion of the lot shall not exceed 300 feet in length,
as measured from the street right-of-way.
(e) The lot shall have an absolute minimum lot width in all
locations of 25 feet, including but not limited to the minimum
lot width as measured along the street right-of-way.
(f) A flag lot shall only be approved for a lot that is protected by a
deed restriction from future subdivision.
(g) Every flag lot shall have a driveway on the lot that provides
access to a street, unless a shared driveway is approved.
(h) A maximum of 10% of the lots within a subdivision may be
approved as flag lots.
(i) The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Township that the proposed driveway would provide adequate
access for emergency vehicles.

§ 192-59 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-59
180:478
§ 192-60. Recreation area design standards and fees.
(j) This section shall not relieve a property of any zoning
requirements other than the minimum lot width.
(k) The minimum front yard requirement shall be met by being
measured back from the location on the lot where the
minimum lot width is met.
(l) A flag lot may be approved behind an existing lot, but a flag lot
shall not be placed behind another flag lot. Therefore, no more
than one tier of flag lots shall be permitted.
H. Drainage.
(1) Existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
properties shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners.
(2) Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge runoff directly over a
sidewalk.
A. Purposes: to provide adequate open spaces, recreational lands and
recreational facilities to serve Township residents for both active and
passive recreation; to recognize and work to carry out the recreation
plan portion of the Comprehensive Plan for Lower Allen Township.
B. Applicability.
(1) This section shall apply to any subdivision or land development for
which a preliminary plan or a combined preliminary/final plan is
submitted after the enactment date of this amendment. This
section shall only apply to a subdivision or land development that
could result in the construction of one or more new dwelling units.
(2) This § 192-60 shall not apply to plans that only involve adjustments
or corrections to an approved preliminary plan or a preliminary
plan that was actively before the Township for consideration as of
the date of the adoption of this section, provided the adjustments
do not increase the number of proposed dwelling units.
C. Limitations on use of fees.
(1) Any fees collected under this section shall be placed in an interestbearing
account and shall be accounted for separately from other
Township funds.
(2) Such fees shall only be used for the following: acquisition of public
open space and related debt payments, development of public
recreational facilities, landscaping of public open space and closely
related engineering and design work.
§ 192-59 SOLID WASTE § 192-60
180:479
D. Land to be preserved. Any subdivision or land development regulated
under this § 192-60 shall be required to preserve the specified amount
of recreation land, unless the Board of Commissioners determines that
recreation fees shall be required in lieu of land.
(1) As a general nonbinding guideline, it is the intent of this section
that smaller developments (such as 10 or fewer dwelling units) that
do not include land that is adjacent to existing publicly owned land
shall be required to pay a recreation land fee in lieu of dedicating
land.
(2) The land and fee requirements of this section shall be based upon
the number of proposed new dwelling units.
(3) Prime recreation land. For the purposes of this section, the term
"prime recreation land" shall mean land proposed to be established
as public recreation land that would meet all of the following
standards:
(a) Slope of less than 6%;
(b) Not a wetland under federal and/or state regulations;
(c) Be part of a contiguous tract of at least two acres (which may
include existing adjacent public recreation land or part of a
Township trail route); and
(d) Not be within the one-hundred-year floodplain, as defined by
official floodplain maps of the Township.
(4) Amount of public recreation land. If a subdivision or land
development is required to include public recreation land, the
following amounts for each permitted new dwelling unit shall
apply:
Percentage of the Total
Required Public Recreation
Land that Would Meet the
Definition of "Prime
Recreation Land"
Minimum Required Public
Recreation Land Per
Permitted Dwelling Unit
(square feet)
0% to 25.0% 6,000
25.1% to 75.0% 3,000
75.1% to 100% 1,500
E. Fees. If the Board of Commissioners determines that a proposed
subdivision or land development is required to pay fees in lieu of
dedicating recreation land, this fee shall be as established by the
Township Fee Schedule, which may be updated by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners.
F. Decision on land vs. fees. The Board of Commissioners shall determine
whether a land dedication would be in the public interest or whether
§ 192-60 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-60
180:480
the payment of fees is required. This determination should, but is not
required to, be made at the time of sketch plan review. The Township
should, at a minimum, consider the following in this decision:
(1) Whether the land in that location would serve a valid public
purpose.
(2) Whether there is potential to make a desirable addition to an
existing public recreation area or to create a greenway along a
creek.
(3) Whether the proposed land would meet the objectives and
requirements of this section and any relevant policies of the
Township Comprehensive Plan and any recreation, open space or
trail plan.
(4) Whether the area surrounding the proposed development has
sufficient existing recreation and open space land and whether it is
accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists.
(5) Any recommendations that may be received from the Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer and the Township Parks and
Recreation Board.
G. Recreation land and common open space requirements. The following
provisions shall apply to both required recreation land and to common
open space that may be required under other Township requirements:
(1) Suitability. Recreation land and common open space shall be
suitable for its intended purpose. The applicant shall state, in
writing, what improvements, if any, he/she will commit to make to
the land to make it suitable for its intended purpose, such as
grading, landscaping or development of trails.
(2) Ownership. Required recreation land shall be dedicated to the
Township, unless the Board of Commissioners agree to accept a
dedication to any of the following: the school district, the county,
the Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks, the Pennsylvania Fish and
Boat Commission, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, a similar
governmental agency, an incorporated property owner association
(such as a homeowners' or condominium association) or an
established environmental organization acceptable to the Board of
Commissioners. In the case of a rental development, the Township
may permit the recreation land or common open space to be
retained by the owner of the adjacent principal buildings.
(a) If recreation land or common open space is to be owned by a
property owner association, the developer shall be required to
establish such association in a form that requires all property
owners within the development to annually contribute to the
maintenance of the common open space.
§ 192-60 SOLID WASTE § 192-60
180:481
[1] Any property owner association agreements regarding
required common open space shall be subject to
acceptance by the Board of Commissioners, based upon
review by the Township Solicitor.
[2] Prior to the sale of any dwelling unit or lot, all deeds shall
require each property owner to pay fees on a regular basis
for the maintenance and other expenses of owning such
land. The property owners shall be incorporated with
covenants and bylaws providing for the filing of
assessments. After providing notice to affected owners,
the Township shall have the authority to establish
municipal liens upon all properties in the association to
fund maintenance of the land and Township legal costs if
the property owners' association does not fulfill its
responsibilities.
[3] An orderly process shall be established for the transfer of
the land to the association. The Township may delay a
transfer of maintenance responsibilities by a developer to
a property owners' association until such association is
incorporated and able to maintain such land.
[4] The property owners' association shall be established in
full compliance with applicable state law, including the
Uniform Planned Community Act.163
(b) Transfer to another entity. If the approved plan states that
ownership of and/or responsibilities to maintain the recreation
land or common open space are limited to a particular entity,
then any transfer of ownership or responsibilities to another
entity shall require pre-approval by the Board of
Commissioners. Where land is to be owned by a conservation
organization, a process should be established for the land to
transfer to a different organization if the first organization is
not able to fulfill its obligations.
(c) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to refuse
to accept an offer of dedication of common open space to the
Township.
(3) Easements/deed restrictions. Any required recreation land or
common open space dedication shall include deed restrictions or
conservation easements to permanently prevent its development
for buildings, except buildings for approved types of
noncommercial recreation or to support maintenance of the land.
Such deed restrictions or conservation easements shall, at a
minimum, be enforceable by the Township. The Board of
163. Editor's Note: See 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.
§ 192-60 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-60
180:482
Commissioners may require that the restrictions or easements also
authorize enforcement by a suitable third party.
(4) Priorities. Priority shall be given to dedication of land that would be
suitable for:
(a) Additions to existing public parks; or
(b) Additions to or extensions of trails; or
(c) Preservation of woods, steep slopes or other important natural
features or land along a creek; or
(d) Centralized active recreation.
(5) Suitability. Land that is not suitable for active or passive recreation
shall not be permitted to meet the requirements of this section.
Portions intended for active recreation shall be well-drained, of an
average slope of less than 6% and not require filling in of a wetland
for use.
(6) Access and contiguousness. Required recreation land and common
open space within a subdivision or land development shall be
contiguous, except as may be specifically exempted by the Board of
Commissioners, and shall have adequate access for maintenance
and by pedestrians and bicycles.
(7) Other ordinances. Any required land dedication or fees under this
section shall be in addition to any land dedication or improvement
requirements of any other Township ordinance.
(8) Residual lands. If only a portion of a larger tract of land is currently
proposed to be subdivided, or the applicant owns one or more
adjacent tracts that are not currently proposed to be subdivided,
the applicant shall provide a sketch of a possible future land
dedication on these adjacent lands. The intent is to coordinate
current plans with any future development, even in the long term.
(9) Coordination with future adjacent dedication. The Board of
Commissioners may require that a required land dedication within
a property currently being subdivided be placed along an edge of
the property so that it may, in the future, be combined with an open
space or public recreation land dedication on the edge of an
adjoining property when that adjoining property is subdivided or
developed.
H. Combination of Land and Fees. Upon mutual agreement of the Board of
Commissioners and the applicant, the Township may accept a
combination of public recreation land and fees in lieu of land to meet
the requirements of this section for a subdivision or land development.
This combination shall be based upon the public recreation land
requirement applying for a certain number of dwelling units and the fee
in lieu of land requirement applying for the remaining development. For
§ 192-60 SOLID WASTE § 192-60
180:483
§ 192-61. Utilities and services.
example, if a development included 25 dwelling units, public recreation
land could be required for 15 dwelling units and fees could be required
for 10 dwelling units.
I. Timing of residential fees. Fees required by this section for all of the
dwelling units shall be paid prior to the recording of the final plan.
J. Facilities in place of land or fees. An applicant may submit a written
request for a modification of the requirements of this section by offering
to construct substantial permanent recreation facilities within the
proposed subdivision or land development or on land dedicated for a
public trail. Such modification shall only be approved if the applicant
clearly demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board of Commissioners
that the facilities will serve a valid public purpose, will be designed
following modern standards in a durable manner and will have a higher
market value than the land or fees that would otherwise be required.
(1) A modification of these requirements may also be approved by the
Board of Commissioners if the applicant donates or sells
appropriate public recreation land to the Township. In such case,
the applicant shall provide a written appraisal from a qualified
professional that the market value of the donation or price
reduction is greater than the value of the fee or land requirement
that is waived. In such case, the land shall be determined to be
suitable for public recreation by the Board of Commissioners.
A. Sanitary sewage disposal systems.
(1) In general.
(a) All subdivisions and land developments shall be served with an
approved and adequate sewage disposal system (either on-lot
or public) that will meet state and Township regulations.
(b) Where a public sanitary sewage system is available within
1,000 feet of, or where plans approved by the Board of
Commissioners or Authority provide for the installation of
public sanitary sewage facilities to within 1,000 feet of, a
proposed subdivision of land development, the applicant shall
provide a complete sanitary sewer system. Such system shall
be designed and constructed in accordance with state,
Township and Authority requirements and shall connect to the
existing public sanitary sewer system.
(c) Public sewage connections. Any principal building or use
within a subdivision or land development that generates
wastewater and that could connect into a public sewage
system shall be required to connect into that system. The
applicant shall be responsible to pay such reasonable capital
expenses that are necessary for such connection.
§ 192-60 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-61
180:484
(2) Central sewage service. See also the Sewers chapter of the Lower
Allen Township Code.164
(a) Lower Allen Township Authority shall have the authority to
approve or reject the proposed sewage collection system for
just cause.
(b) Nonpublic sewage service. If nonpublic central sewage service
is proposed, the Board of Commissioners shall have the
authority to permit or not permit such service to meet the
sewage requirements of this section based upon:
[1] Whether public sewage service is expected to be available
within five years of the date of preliminary plan approval;
[2] Whether the proposed system would be consistent with the
Township's official Sewage Facilities Plan; and
[3] Whether the system would include an appropriate
permanent system for professional operation and
maintenance.
(3) On-lot sewage disposal system.
(a) If connection to a public sewage system is not required at the
time of occupancy, and if a nonpublic central sewage system is
not approved by the Township under the Township Sewage
Facilities Plan, then each lot shall be required to be served by
an on-lot sewage disposal system that will meet all applicable
state regulations. Each such proposed location shall be tested
and approved by the Township Sewage Enforcement Officer
prior to approval of the final plan.
(b) Portable chemical toilets allowed as per DEP regulation or
other approved privies shall not be used as a primary method
of sewage service for a subdivision or land development that
operates more than 10 days in any calendar year, other than
publicly owned outdoor recreation uses and construction sites.
(c) See the Township Zoning Ordinance,165 which requires a tested
alternate septic system location meeting all DEP regulations.
(d) The applicant shall submit results or a summary of the tests of
required on-lot septic tests and shall show approved test
locations on the preliminary plans in accordance with DEP
planning module requirements.
(4) Laterals. Each lot with central sewage service shall be served by a
separate sewage lateral.
164. Editor's Note: See Ch. 175, Sewers.
165. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Zoning.
§ 192-61 SOLID WASTE § 192-61
180:485
B. Water supply systems, fire hydrants and fire protection.
(1) In general.
(a) All subdivisions and land developments shall be served with an
adequate on-lot or central water supply system that will meet
DEP and Township requirements.
(b) Where a public water main supply system is available within
1,000 feet of, or where plans approved by the Board of
Commissioners or public water utility provide for the
installation of public water facilities to within 1,000 feet of, a
proposed subdivision of land development, the applicant shall
provide a complete public water main supply system. Such
system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
state, Township and public water utility requirements and shall
connect to the existing public water main supply system.
(c) Required connections to central water systems.
[1] The Board of Commissioners, after requesting any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Township Engineer and the appropriate water supplier,
shall require all lots and principal uses within a
subdivision or land development to be connected to an
existing public or Township-approved central water
system where the Board of Commissioners determines
that such connection would be feasible, cost-effective and
reasonable, considering the distances that the lines would
need to be extended and the average cost per dwelling or
lot.
(2) Central water supply system.
(a) Water supplier approval. Proposed extensions of central water
systems shall meet all applicable procedures, reviews and
requirements of any appropriate municipal authority or water
company. Such extension shall be approved by such agency
prior to final plan approval, although specific detailed service
agreements are not required to be signed until prior to
recording.
(b) Nonpublic supplier. Any new central water system that is not
owned by a public authority or municipality shall be found to
be acceptable in capacity, pressure, design and construction.
The Board of Commissioners may deny permission for a
subdivision or land development to be served by a nonpublic
central water system if such system cannot guarantee
sufficient water pressure and capacity and would not include a
suitable process for long-term operation and maintenance.
(3) On-lot water system (wells).
§ 192-61 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-61
180:486
(a) Well locations. When a subdivision or land development is not
required to connect to a central water system, acceptable
locations for on-lot water systems shall be shown on plans and
shall be constructed in accordance with regulations of DEP.
(b) Setback. Wells shall be located no closer than 25 feet from any
existing or future street right-of-way. Wells shall also be
located to meet minimum requirements of the Federal Housing
Administration.
(4) Fire hydrants. All subdivisions and land developments that will be
served by central water service shall provide fire hydrants as
needed with appropriate water pressure so that all dwelling units
are within 600 feet of an active fire hydrant. All nonresidential
principal buildings shall be located within 400 feet of an active fire
hydrant.
(a) All hydrants shall be placed with the steamer nozzle facing
toward the street or parking lot and shall be located so that
they are accessible to within five feet by fire apparatus.
(b) All hydrants shall provide one five-inch Storz connection.
(c) Fire flows shall not be less than 500 gallons per minute in
single-family residential areas and 1,000 gallons per minute in
other development areas at 20 psi residual pressure.
(d) The water system supplying the hydrants shall be capable of
meeting maximum domestic consumption at all times, plus
required fire flow for a minimum duration of two hours.
(e) The Board of Commissioners may grant a modification of these
requirements based upon a written recommendation by a
professional engineer with expertise in fire protection.
(5) Water studies.
(a) Purposes. To provide the Township with information to
properly evaluate the impact a proposed development will have
upon groundwater resources. To make sure that adequate
water supplies will be available to service a proposed
development without negatively impacting adjacent uses
dependent upon the same water sources.
(b) A hydrogeologic study shall be required to be submitted by the
applicant whenever a proposed use, subdivision or land
development will be served by noncentral water supplies.
Note: Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection may also require the submission of a
hydrogeological study as part of the sewage facility planning
process.
§ 192-61 SOLID WASTE § 192-61
180:487
(c) This Subsection B(5) shall not apply to a development that will
be served by a public central water system.
(d) Credentials. The study shall be prepared by a professional
geologist or professional engineer with substantial experience
in preparing similar studies. Before any person or entity is
engaged to prepare the study, the applicant shall submit
written credentials of the individual who will direct the study.
The Township shall then have a maximum of 45 days from the
date of receipt to the Township to determine whether the
individual's credentials are acceptable. The Township may also
pre-approve a written list of individuals who are known to be
qualified to complete these types of studies.
(e) The hydrogeologic study, at a minimum, shall include the
following:
[1] A location map for the proposed development showing
proximity to waterways, lakes and major roads.
[2] Existing water supply wells within 1/2 mile of the proposed
development (may be appropriate locations).
[3] A proposed thirty-day average rate and maximum daily
rate of groundwater or springwater withdrawal from each
water source.
[4] A map showing water withdrawal points.
[5] An analysis of the impacts of the water withdrawal upon
the groundwater supply and upon uses and creek levels
within a 1/2 mile radius of the project, including
agricultural activities.
[6] The analysis shall consider impacts during both normal
conditions and drought conditions. Drought conditions
shall be documented.
[7] The Board of Commissioners may require that the study
include the construction of test wells to determine the
impacts. The level, rates, dates and times of water
measurements shall be provided, and weather conditions
shall be documented. The impacts upon a reasonable
sampling of existing wells shall be recorded, provided that
the owners of such wells grant permission for such studies.
(f) If the Township determines that the water withdrawal could
have a significant negative impact upon existing water users,
then as a condition of any development approval, the Township
may require that the applicant commit in a legally binding
manner to appropriate mitigation of the negative impacts. This
mitigation may include, but is not limited to:
§ 192-61 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 192-61
180:488
[1] A financial guarantee to fund a deeper well or a connection
to a central water system for properties that experience
negative impacts after the water withdrawal occurs;
[2] A permanent conservation easement placed on sufficient
land areas to result in amounts of groundwater recharge
that is equivalent to the amount of groundwater that is
being withdrawn; or
[3] A legally binding commitment to reduce the amount of the
water withdrawal during drought conditions.
C. Utilities and easements.
(1) Utilities.
(a) All electric power, telephone, data, cable television and natural
gas service lines within a new subdivision or land development
shall be placed underground, and be installed in accordance
with the current standards of the utility serving the subdivision
or land development.

provide written evidence from the operator of such pipeline
that such activity is acceptable under his or her safety
standards and the terms of that right-of-way.
§ 192-61 SOLID WASTE § 192-61
180:489
§ 192-62. Stormwater management.
(g) Locations. Easements shall be placed along lot lines or street
rights-of-way to the maximum extent possible, as opposed to
the center of a lot.
(h) Maintenance and obstructions. The owner of the lot shall
properly maintain an easement or right-of-way in such a
condition that does not inhibit its intended purpose(s). Fill or
structures shall not be placed in an easement or right-of-way in
a way that inhibits its intended purpose(s). Specifically,
structures or grading that could alter or obstruct stormwater
flows in violation of the approved final plan shall be prohibited
within stormwater easements.
(i) Township entry. The Township, at its option, shall have the
right to enter a stormwater easement or any municipal
easement or right-of-way to maintain it or improve it for its
intended purpose(s), although the Township does not accept
the responsibility to complete such work.
D. Streetlighting.
(1) Streetlights shall be placed at street intersections. Streetlights may
be placed at additional locations along streets.
(2) Such lights shall meet lamp and wiring standards established by
the applicable electric company. Pole types shall be acceptable to
the Township.

have the authority to approve modifications, in writing, at a legally
advertised meeting open to the public, to a specific street,
improvement and other requirements of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance. Such modifications shall not require proof
of hardship and shall be intended to result in a development that is
pedestrian-oriented or promotes low-speed traffic and that meets
the purposes of a TND.
(2) The applicant shall submit a request for modifications in writing,
which shall state the reasons why the modification would be
consistent with the purposes for a TND as stated in this chapter

plan shall address the timing of improvements that are required.
The phasing plan shall address the timing of construction of
through streets and access points necessary for emergency
vehicles and routine traffic circulation.
(2) Compliance shall be determined at the completion of each phase,
so that each individual phase does not need to meet every
requirement. For example, if Phase 1 includes more common open
space than is required, then Phase 2 may include less common
open space than is required, provided the requirement is met at the
completion of Phase 2.

Residential Permit Parking
[Added 11-10-1997 by L.L. No. 97-10]
§ 209-29.1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Lower Allen Township Residential
Parking Permit Ordinance."
§ 209-29.2. Findings and purpose.
The Board of Commissioners finds that:
§ 209-29.3. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, words and terms listed in this section, as
follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident but who owns or manages a
business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address. For
the purpose of this article, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking
permit for that business or professional office address.
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide
occupancy, or both, at that address.
A. Certain residential areas in Lower Allen Township are subjected to
commuter vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those
areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles.
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient
air level.
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners considers it to be in the
interest of the people of Lower Allen Township to provide for the
establishment of a residential permit parking program to ensure
primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents.
D. Some narrow residential streets are subject to the interruption of
services such as refuse, collection, deliveries, and fire protection when
commuter vehicles fill in parking spaces on both sides of the residential
street. [Added 8-20-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-13]
§ 209-29.1 VECTOR CONTROL § 209-29.3
206:581
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways or
parts of public highways abutted by residential property or residential and
nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals
and nursing homes).
§ 209-29.4. Criteria of designation.
The residential areas designated in § 209-29.5 of this article are those
deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis of
the following criteria:
§ 209-29.5. Designation of areas.
A. The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment.
B. The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in Lower Allen
Township.
C. The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking, service
interruptions, and related health and safety hazards. [Amended
8-20-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-13]
D. The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
E. The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking and
their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection with it.
F. The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential
permit parking area and used by the general public for religious, health
or educational purposes.
A. The following streets shall be designated as residential permit parking:

parking permit area. Each residence shall be entitled to three parking

residential permit parking regulation or restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the

and impound vehicles that are parked on any street in the Township in
violation of any provision of this chapter.
§ 209-31. Authority to remove and impound.
The municipality type shall have authority to remove and impound or to

§ 209-32. Towing and storage of impounded vehicles.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only

evidence to the Board of Commissioners that it is bonded or has acquired
liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners
as sufficient to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or
damage to those vehicles while in the custody of the garagekeeper for the
purpose of towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to
the Board of Commissioners its schedule of charges for towing and storage
of vehicles under this article, and, when the schedule is approved by the

approval of the Board of Commissioners, and no different charges shall be
demanded of or collected from any person whose vehicle is removed or
impounded under this article by any approved storage garage. The Board

shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a District Justice. Payment
of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver of any
vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the provision
of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 209-35. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The municipality type shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles

control of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and intention
to remove the vehicle immediately.

supersede definitions as contained in Article II of this chapter, unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise:
BUILDING WALL SIGN  A building sign that is mounted parallel to
the building wall.
DEVELOPMENT IDENTIFICATION SIGN  An off-premises or onpremises
identification sign, located in a TND development, that
primarily indicates the names of the core neighborhoods, specific
residential neighborhoods inside and outside of core neighborhoods,
and for the TND development.

adequate signage for the mix of residential and nonresidential uses
that are permitted to coexist in core neighborhoods. Nonresidential
uses are provided with adequate opportunities for identification
that also minimize the impact upon adjacent residential uses.
C. Maximum number of sign types. Unless specified and limited in the
following tables, all of the specific sign types (i.e., freestanding signs,
building wall signs, window signs, projecting signs) for the specific sign
message classifications (i.e., residential identification signs,

neighborhood may install changeable message sign in accordance with
other provisions of this § 220-132.2 and Article XXV, provided that
activation of message change is by manual means. Changeable message
signs may be either electrically or manually activated in core
neighborhoods. Electrical activation may include projection or rotation
of sign copy, or electronically programmed message changes. Scrolling
message changes are permitted, but flashing and animated signs, as
defined in § 220-6, are prohibited.

proposed in order to serve the WCF applicant's service
area and that no other viable alternative location exists.
[2] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed
tower or other communication facilities and equipment, a
description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed
transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range
(megahertz band) assigned to the WCF applicant, the
power in watts at which the WCF applicant transmits, and
any relevant related tests conducted by the WCF applicant
in determining the need for the proposed site and
installation.
[3] The conditional use application shall also be accompanied
by documentation demonstrating that the proposed towerbased
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and
regulations concerning aviation safety.
[4] Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the WCF applicant shall present
documentation to the Board of Commissioners that the
owner of the property has granted an easement for the
proposed WCF and that vehicular access will be provided
to the facility.
[5] The conditional use application shall also be accompanied
by documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-
§ 220-207 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-207
216:826
based WCF complies with all applicable provisions in this
section.
(d) Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township's issuance of a
permit authorizing construction and erection of a tower-based
WCF, the applicant shall testify at the conditional use hearing
that it will obtain written certification from a structural
engineer registered in Pennsylvania of the proposed WCF's
ability to meet the structural standards offered by either the
Electronic Industries Association or the Telecommunication
Industry Association and certify the proper construction of the
foundation and the erection of the structure.
(e) Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based
WCF shall employ stealth technology, which may include the
tower portion to be painted silver or another color approved by
the Board of Commissioners, or shall have a galvanized finish.
All tower-based WCF and related equipment shall be
aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the
surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a like
facade to blend with the existing surroundings and
neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. The
Board of Commissioners shall consider whether its decision
upon the subject application will promote the harmonious and
orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by
preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the
community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site
to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound
engineering and land development design and construction
principles, practices and techniques. The Township Board of
Commissioners or its designee shall employ the judgment of a
reasonable person evaluating the totality of the circumstances
when determining whether the stealth technology chosen by
the applicant appropriately blends in with the surrounding
area.
(f) Co-location and siting. An application for a new tower-based
WCF shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF
cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved structure
or building, or sited on land owned and maintained by Lower
Allen Township. The Board of Commissioners may deny an
application to construct a new tower-based WCF if the WCF
applicant has not made a good-faith effort to mount the
commercial communications antenna(s) on an existing
structure. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers
of a height equal to or greater than the proposed WCF within a
one-fourth-mile radius of the site proposed, sought permission
§ 220-207 (RESERVED) § 220-207
216:827
to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and towers
and was denied for one of the following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower,
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
[3] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
[4] A commercially reasonable agreement could not be
reached with the owner of such building, structure, or
tower.
(g) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible
under applicable state and federal law, any WCF applicant
proposing the modification of an existing tower-based WCF,
which increases the overall height of such WCF, shall first
obtain a building permit from the Township. Nonroutine
modifications shall be prohibited without such permit.
(h) Gap in coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage or
capacity exists in the applicable area and that the type of WCF
being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that
gap in wireless coverage. The existence or nonexistence of a
gap in wireless coverage shall be a factor in the Township's
decision on an application for approval of tower-based WCF.
(i) Additional antennas. Where permitted by federal law, as a
condition of approval for all tower-based WCF, the WCF
applicant shall provide the Township with a written
commitment that it will allow other service providers to colocate
antennas on tower-based WCF where technically and
economically feasible. The owner of a tower-based WCF shall
not install any additional antennas without obtaining the prior
written approval of the Township.
(j) Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be designed to
withstand the effects of wind gusts of at least 100 miles per
hour in addition to the standard designed by the American
National Standards Institute as prepared by the engineering
departments of the Electronics Industry Association, and

as amended.
(k) Height.
[1] Any tower-based WCF shall be designed at the minimum
functional height. In all zoning districts the maximum
height of any new tower-based WCF shall be 200 feet. An
existing tower may be modified or extended to a height not
to exceed a total height of 215 feet to accommodate the colocation
of additional communications antennas. Towerbased
WCF in the public rights-of-way shall not exceed the
average height of other poles in the public rights-of-way,
such as light poles or utility poles.
[2] WCF installations located above the surface grade in the
public right-of-way including, but not limited to, those on
streetlights and joint utility poles, shall consist of
equipment components that are no more than six feet in
height and that are compatible in scale and proportion to
the structures upon which they are mounted. All
equipment shall be the smallest and least visibly intrusive
equipment feasible.
(l) Related equipment. Either one single-story wireless
communications equipment building not exceeding 500 square
feet in area or up to five metal boxes placed on a concrete pad
not exceeding 10 feet by 20 feet or other method of approved
installation in area housing the receiving and transmitting
equipment may be located on the site for each unrelated
company sharing commercial communications antenna(s)
space on the tower-based Wireless Communications Facility.
(m) Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF shall
interfere with public safety communications or the reception of
broadband, television, radio or other communication services
enjoyed by occupants of nearby properties.

Frequency Electromagnetic Fields," as amended.
(p) Historic buildings or districts. A tower-based WCF shall not be
located upon a property, and/or on a building or structure that
is listed on either the National or Pennsylvania Registers of
Historic Places, or eligible to be so listed, or is included in the
official historic structures and/or historic districts list
maintained by the Township.
(q) Signs. All tower-based WCFs shall post a sign in a readily
visible location identifying the name and phone number of a
party to contact in the event of an emergency. The only other
signage permitted on the WCF shall be those required by the
FCC, or any other federal or state agency.
(r) Lighting. No tower-based WCF shall be artificially lighted,
except as required by law. If lighting is required, the WCF
applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting,
demonstrating as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is
permissible under state and federal regulations. The WCF
applicant shall promptly report any outage or malfunction of
FAA-mandated lighting to the appropriate governmental
authorities and to the Township Manager.
(s) Noise. Tower-based WCF shall be operated and maintained so
as not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards
under state law and the Township Code, except in emergency
situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where such
noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only.
(t) Aviation safety. Tower-based WCF shall comply with all federal
and state laws and regulations concerning aviation safety.
(u) Retention of experts. The Township may hire any consultant
and/or expert necessary to assist the Township in reviewing
and evaluating the application for approval of the tower-based
WCF and, once approved, in reviewing and evaluating any
potential violations of the terms and conditions of these
provisions. The WCF applicant and/or owner of the WCF shall
reimburse the Township for all costs of the Township's
consultant(s) in providing expert evaluation and consultation
in connection with these activities.
(v) Timing of approval. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an
application for a tower-based WCF is filed with the Township,
the Township shall notify the WCF applicant in writing of any
information that may be required to complete such application.
All applications for tower-based WCFs shall be acted upon

216:830
within 150 days of the receipt of a fully completed application
for the approval of such tower-based WCF, and the Township
shall advise the WCF applicant in writing of its decision. If
additional information was requested by the Township to
complete an application, the time required by the WCF
applicant to provide the information shall not be counted
toward the one-hundred-fifty-day review period.
(w) Nonconforming uses. Nonconforming tower-based WCF which
are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason or
cause may be repaired and restored at their former location,
but must otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of
this section.
(x) Removal. In the event that use of a tower-based WCF is
planned to be discontinued, the owner shall provide written
notice to the Township of its intent to discontinue use and the
date when the use shall be discontinued. Unused or abandoned
WCF or portions of WCF shall be removed as follows:
[1] All unused or abandoned tower-based WCFs and accessory
facilities shall be removed within six months of the
cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension
is approved by the Township.
[2] If the WCF and/or accessory facility is not removed within
six months of the cessation of operations at a site, or
within any longer period approved by the Township, the
WCF and accessory facilities and equipment may be
removed by the Township and the cost of removal assessed
against the owner of the WCF.
[3] Any unused portions of tower-based WCF, including
antennas, shall be removed within six months of the time

and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
C. Nonconforming uses (for purposes of this article).
(1) Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming
use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective
date of this chapter and is diligently executed.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or
tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of
such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the applicant.
A. Future uses. Except as specifically provided hereunder, no material
change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby
created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to
be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is
in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a
variance has been approved in accordance with Subsection D herein.
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the Horizontal Surface Zone
and Conical Surface Zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground,
§ 220-230 (RESERVED) § 220-231
216:853
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree
or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such approach zones.
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic feature, would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such transition zones. Nothing contained in any
of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or
intending to permit any construction or alteration of any structure
or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this article, except that no permit is required to
make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of existing
structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an
existing structure.
B. Existing uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or any tree may be allowed to grow
higher or be replanted, a permit must be secured from the Township,
authorizing the replacement or change. No permit shall be granted that
would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is
made.
C. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or
tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this
article.
D. Variance. For purposes of this article, any person desiring to erect any
structure or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth
of any object of natural growth or otherwise use his property in
violation of airport zoning regulations may apply to the Zoning Hearing
Board for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. A variance
shall only be granted after the requirements of § 220-269C are satisfied.
A variance may be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of
the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
§ 220-231 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-231
216:854
§ 220-232. Enforcement; notice.
hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but would do substantial justice and would be in accordance
with the spirit of the regulations and this chapter. Any variance may be
granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the Zoning Hearing
Board may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination
from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal
on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use
of navigable airspace. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Zoning Hearing
Board unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the
applicable airport manager (or person of equivalent description) for
advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the applicable
airport manager (or person of equivalent description) does not respond
to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Zoning Hearing
Board may act without such input to grant or deny said application.
E. Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permits or variance under
this section, the Board shall, if it deems the action advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this article and reasonable under the
circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the
owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the Township, at its own expense, or require the person or persons
requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain
thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or
regulations adopted by the FAA.
A. Local enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications
for permits and variance shall be made to the Zoning Officer upon a
form published for that purpose. Applications required by this article to
be submitted to the Zoning Officer shall be promptly considered and
granted or denied. Application for action by the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Officer.
B. Notice to Department of Transportation. Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, a municipality or board which decides to grant a
permit or variance under this article shall notify the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation, of its decision. This
notice shall be in writing and shall be sent so as to reach the
Department at least 10 days before the date upon which the decision is
to be issued.

Groundwater Nonuse Overlay District
§ 220-233. Purpose and intent; authority.
§ 220-234. Establishment and delineation.
The Groundwater Nonuse Overlay District shall be defined as that area
within the corporate boundaries of the Township as is set forth on the
Zoning Map and incorporated herein by reference thereto. Specifically,
the Nonuse Overlay District is defined as all lands zoned I-3 Industrial/
Commercial at the time of adoption on October 27, 2003, or lying within
1000 feet of those lands so zoned.. Where the boundary of the Nonuse
Overlay District divides any property, the entire property shall be
considered to lie within the Nonuse Overlay District.
§ 220-235. Regulated groundwater uses.
Within the Nonuse Overlay District, land uses shall be regulated as follows:
A. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare through the prohibition of groundwater use for agricultural use
or as a drinking water supply. The designation of the Nonuse Overlay
District, as provided herein, and the regulation of activities within such
Nonuse Overlay District will reduce the potential for public exposure to
contaminated groundwater. The delineation of the Nonuse Overlay
District and the development of the provisions of this article are based
upon a professional study of the hydrogeologic features of the Township
and the distribution of groundwater contamination within the Township
and surrounding areas.
B. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in the
Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 of 1968, as
amended, which provisions authorize the Township to enact ordinances
regulating development and land uses to ensure the public health and
safety, provide a safe, reliable and adequate water supply, and preserve
natural values and aquifers.
A. Groundwater may not be used as a drinking water source or for
agricultural use.
B. Any property currently using groundwater as a drinking water source
or for agricultural use must immediately connect to the existing
community water supply.
C. Following connection, the existing well must be abandoned as a
drinking water source or for agricultural use in accordance with PA
DEP well abandonment criteria and guidelines.
§ 220-233 (RESERVED) § 220-235
216:857
§ 220-236. Subdivision and land development plans.
All subdivision and land development plans to be located within the Nonuse
Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer and the Township
Planning Commission for compliance with the provisions of this article. It
shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Officer and the Township Planning
Commission to recommend approval, disapproval or approval with
conditions and modifications of the proposed plan so as to assure
compliance with the provisions of this article.
D. Grandfathering of existing uses is prohibited. The use of all existing
wells as drinking water sources or for agricultural uses must cease
within 90 days after the effective date of this article.
E. It shall be the responsibility of any person owning real property and/or
owning or operating a business within the Township of Lower Allen
Township to make a determination of the applicability of the Nonuse
Overlay District as it pertains to the property and/or business under his/
her ownership or operation, and his/her failure to do so shall not excuse
any violations of said sections.

thereto shall be stone, gravel or paved surfaces.
C. A garage or carport may be located wholly or partly inside the walls of
the principal building or attached to the outer walls. If separated from
the principal building, the garage shall conform to all accessory
building requirements. A garage may be constructed under a yard,
provided that the level of such yard shall conform to the general level of
the other yards on the lot. The space above such an underground
garage shall be deemed to be part of the open space of the lot on which
it is located.
D. Parking shall not be permitted in front yards of residential uses, except

§ 220-241. Reduction in parking spaces and stacking distance
requirements.
The Zoning Hearing Board may authorize, by special exception, a reduction
in the number and size of required off-street parking spaces and/or stacking
distance requirements in cases where the applicant can justify the
reduction and still provide adequate parking facilities and stacking
distances to serve the proposed uses of the structure or land.
§ 220-242. Parking area location and design requirements.
A. Existing parking. Structures and uses existing on the effective date of
this chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this article so
long as the type or extent of use is not changed, provided that any
parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced below such requirements.
B. Changes in requirements. Whenever there is an alteration of a
structure or change or extension of a use which increases the parking
requirements according to the standards contained herein, the total
parking required for the existing structure and use, as well as the
alteration, change or extension, shall be provided in accordance with
the requirements of that section.
C. Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any use that
interferes with its availability for the parking need it is required to
serve. This shall include the utilization of required parking areas for the
storage and sale of seasonal merchandise.
D. Continuing obligation. All required parking facilities shall be provided
and maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities were
designed to serve. Off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced in
total extent after their provision. Reasonable precautions are to be
taken by the owner or sponsor of particular uses to assure the
availability of required facilities for the employees or other persons
whom the facilities are designed to serve. Facilities shall at no time
constitute a nuisance, hazard or unreasonable impediment to traffic.
E. Drainage, surfacing and maintenance. Drainage, surfacing and
maintenance of off-street parking areas, including driveways and
access drives, shall be completed in accordance with Chapter 184,
Stormwater Management, as amended, and Chapter 192, Subdivision
and Land Development, as amended.
F. Shared parking. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in
a common parking lot if the total space provided is not less than the
§ 220-240 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-242
216:866
sum of the spaces required for each use individually. The number of
spaces required in a common parking facility may be reduced below
this total only as a special exception if it can be demonstrated to the
Zoning Hearing Board that the hours or days of peak parking needed
for the uses are so different that a lower total will adequately provide
for all uses served by the facility. A maintenance agreement for shared
parking facilities shall be established between affected parties. Such
agreement shall be binding on all future affected parties, heirs and
assigns of the property.
G. Computation of spaces. Where the computation of required parking
spaces results in a fractional number, any fraction shall be counted as
one.
H. Internal access and circulation.
(1) Internal access and circulation to parking areas shall be designed
so as not to obstruct the free flow of traffic. Pedestrian crosswalks
leading from parking areas to main building entrances shall be
provided and shall be appropriately marked.
(2) The geometric design of driveways, access drives and parking lots
or areas shall allow access by emergency service vehicles.
I. Location of spaces.
(1) Single- and two-family residential off-street parking spaces shall be
provided on the same lot or premises with the use served, unless
provided for otherwise on an approved subdivision or land
development plan.
(2) Parking spaces for multifamily dwellings and nonresidential uses
shall be readily accessible to the buildings served thereby. Such
spaces shall be in the same zoning district as the principal building
or open area and shall conform to the following regulations:
(a) The required parking spaces shall be located within 600 feet of
the principal building or open space in question, measured
from the edge of structure or open space to the edge of the
parking lot closest to the structure or open space.
(b) If parking is to be provided on a lot other than the lot of the
principal building or use, then the applicant for a use or
building permit shall submit, with his/her application, an
instrument duly executed and acknowledged which subjects
such parcels of land to parking uses in connection with the
principal use to which it is accessory. Upon issuance of a
permit, the Zoning Officer shall cause such instrument to be
recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds.
J. Lighting of parking areas shall be required for all parking areas having
more than 20 spaces. Such lighting may be provided through the use of
§ 220-242 (RESERVED) § 220-242
216:867
light fixtures on either a pole or building and shall comply with
performance standards as set forth in Article XV herein.
K. Screen planting and buffer yards shall be provided in accordance with
Article XV herein.
L. Dimensional requirements.
(1) Minimum dimensions.
(a) The minimum dimensions of parking facilities to be provided
shall be as follows:

ARTICLE XXV
Signs
§ 220-245. Purpose.
The intent of this article is to strike a reasonable balance between the need
or desire to display public information on signs with the need or desire
to minimize visual conflicts that can occur when placement of signs is not
adequately controlled. Appropriate design, placement and maintenance of
signage can complement the visual appeal of the community and facilitate
safe and efficient travel within the Township. Absence of appropriate
standards can allow development of signage that distracts or competes
excessively for visual attention or that detracts from the desirable
appearance of the community.
§ 220-246. Definitions.
In addition to the words and terms included in § 220-6, Definitions, pictorial
descriptions of certain sign types defined in this section are provided by
Exhibits XXV-1 through XXV-2.247
§ 220-247. General regulations.
A. No sign shall be placed, erected, altered, enlarged or relocated until a
permit for doing so has been issued by the Zoning Officer. A
construction permit shall also be required unless the sign proposal
satisfies exemption criteria listed in Chapter 70, Building Construction
and Safety Standards. Signs listed in § 220-251 herein are exempt from
zoning permit requirements, provided that the use of such signs is in
accordance with other provisions of this article. Applications shall be
submitted on forms provided by the Township, shall indicate consent of
the owner of the premises upon which the sign is to be located and shall
be accompanied by supporting information that is sufficient to
determine compliance with this article and any other relevant
ordinances. Examples of supporting data that may be required include
a scale drawing with relevant dimensions noted to illustrate the
proposed height, area, size and sign copy; a plot plan of the property on
which the sign will be located to illustrate the position of proposed
signs relative to buildings, structures, lot lines and rights-of-way;
illumination method and materials; and support systems, structural
loads, stresses and anchoring details. Compliance with performance
criteria may require certification by a registered design professional.
B. Signs and sign components may be removed for repair and
maintenance, provided that they are restored to the same height, size,
area and location authorized by permit. Repair and maintenance
activities that do not affect the height, size, area or location of a sign do
not require a zoning permit; however, if these activities affect structural
247. Editor's Note: Exhibits XXV-1 and XXV-2 are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 220-245 (RESERVED) § 220-247
216:873

or electrical components of the sign, a construction permit may be
necessary.
C. No sign may be erected or maintained that may be confused with any
authorized traffic control device.
D. Animated signs are not permitted in any district.
E. Changeable message signs are permitted in all zoning districts, subject
to limitations contained in § 220-252D herein.
F. Every sign permitted by this article shall be kept in good condition and
repair. When the Code Official determines that a sign is unsafe,
unsecured, is a menace to the public or has been installed, erected or
maintained in violation of any provision of this chapter, written notice
shall be given to the owner of the sign, in accordance with § 220-268
herein. Said notice shall set forth a reasonable time period in which
violation(s) shall be corrected. Immediate action may be required in the
case of imminent danger to the public.
G. Any off-premises directional sign associated with a use that is no longer
active, and any on-premises sign copy that no longer relates to a use
conducted at the property on which it is located, except memorial signs,
shall be covered or removed by the sign owner or property owner
within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Code Official, in
accordance with § 220-268 herein. Any obsolete sign structure that is
not reused for a new sign within one year of such notice shall be
deemed abandoned. Any abandoned sign and structure, and any
temporary sign that is displayed beyond the permitted time limit, shall
be removed by the sign owner or property owner within 30 days of
receipt of written notice from the Code Official, in accordance with
§ 220-268 herein. Upon failure to comply with a notice regarding an
obsolete or abandoned sign, or a temporary sign that remains in place
after expiration of the display time period, the Code Official is hereby
authorized to cause removal or covering of obsolete sign copy, or
removal of temporary and abandoned signs. Any expense incident
thereto shall be assessed to the property. When an obsolete or
abandoned wall sign is removed, the wall of the building or structure on
which it was attached shall be restored to resemble the appearance of
the wall surrounding the sign location.
A. Placement standards.
(1) No sign shall be installed in a public right-of-way unless installation
is authorized by the authority having jurisdiction. Permitted sign
types are limited to traffic control devices, signs displayed on
public transportation passenger shelters, temporary street banners
advertising special events for civic or charitable nonprofit
§ 220-247 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-248
216:874
organizations and building identification signs displayed on
mailboxes.
(2) No sign shall be affixed to a natural object such as a tree, shrub or
rock, or to a utility structure or utility pole, with the following
exceptions: regulatory notice signs, such as those used to regulate
hunting and trespassing, may be attached to a tree. A street banner
may be attached to a utility structure or utility pole, or a tree,
provided that permission is granted from the owner of the utility
structure, utility pole or tree.
(3) No sign may be mounted on a roof; however, signs may be mounted
on roof-like architectural projections of walls, such as pent eaves
and mansards, provided that the sign does not project above the
highest part of the wall. Roof signs are pictorially described on
Exhibits XXV-1 and XXV-2.
(4) No sign or sign structure shall be erected at any street intersection
in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision, nor at any
location where it may interfere with or obstruct any traffic control
device.
(5) A vertical clearance height of at least eight feet shall be provided
between the surface of a public walkway and any sign that projects
over the walkway.
(6) No freestanding sign, together with any supporting framework,
shall extend to a height above the maximum building height
allowed within the respective district.

(3) Strings of bulbs are not permitted, except as part of a holiday
celebration.
(4) All electrical components of any sign shall comply with the
electrical code referenced in the Pennsylvania Uniform
Construction Code as modified by Chapter 70, Building
Construction and Safety Standards, as amended.
A. Any sign lawfully existing at the effective date of this chapter that does
not conform to the requirements of this chapter shall be considered
nonconforming, and the nonconforming use, location, area, height and/
or size may be continued until such time as replacement or rebuilding
becomes necessary. Replacement of copy or panels upon which copy is
displayed does not constitute replacement or rebuilding of the sign,
provided that the structure supporting the copy or copy panels is not
rebuilt or replaced, and the new copy or copy panels are not larger in
any dimension than those being replaced.
B. When a nonconforming sign is replaced or rebuilt, the following
limitations shall apply:
(1) A nonconforming sign damaged by fire, explosion, windstorm or
other sudden natural or criminal act may be reconstructed or
restored, provided that the reconstruction or restoration does not
conflict with any regulation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the degree of nonconformity of the original sign is not
increased.
(2) When the land upon which a nonconforming sign is located is taken
for public purposes through eminent domain proceedings, the
nonconforming sign may be relocated or replaced elsewhere on the
residual property, provided that the degree of nonconformity of the
original sign is not increased.
(3) All other nonconforming signs may only be replaced with or rebuilt
as conforming signs, in accordance with all applicable provisions of
this chapter.
A. The area of a sign shall be the area of the smallest geometric figure, or
the sum of the combination of regular geometric figures, which
comprise the sign face. The area of any double-sided or V-shaped sign
shall be the area of the largest single face. Any portion of the sign face
that displays a street address for the building to which the sign is
associated shall not be included in the area calculation.
§ 220-248 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-250
216:876
(1) In the case of panel or cabinet-type signs, the sign face shall
include the entire area of the sign panel, cabinet or substrate upon
which the sign copy is displayed or illustrated, but not open space
between separate panels or cabinets.
(2) In the case of sign structures with routed areas of sign copy, the
sign face shall include the entire area of the surface that is routed,
except interrupted by a reveal, border or contrasting surface or
color.
(3) In the case of signs painted on a building, or individual letters or
graphic elements affixed to a building or structure, the sign face
shall comprise the sum of the geometric figures or combination of
regular geometric figures drawn closest to the edge of the letters
or separate graphic elements comprising the sign copy, but not the
open space between separate groupings of sign copy on the same
building or structure.
(4) In the case of sign copy enclosed within a painted or illuminated
border, or displayed on a background contrasting in color with the
building or structure, the sign face shall comprise the area within
the contrasting background, or within the painted or illuminated
border.
(5) Sign area computation methodology is pictorially described on
Exhibits XXV-3 and XXV-4.
B. Height.
(1) The height of any building sign is limited to the actual height of the
building. The height limit for a freestanding sign shall be
established in the specific regulations for the district in which it is
located, but in no case may it be greater than the maximum
permitted building height of the respective district.
(2) The height limit of any freestanding sign shall be measured relative
to the surface elevation of the road from which the freestanding
sign is intended to be viewed. If the center-line elevation of the
road cartway has a higher elevation than the ground elevation at
the proposed sign location, when measured along a line connecting
these two points and running perpendicular to the intersecting lot
line, the sign height limit may be increased by the resulting
difference in elevation. If this same measurement methodology
indicates that the ground at the proposed sign location has a higher
elevation than the center-line elevation of the roadway from which
the sign is intended to be viewed, then the sign height limit
prescribed by the appropriate section within this article may not be
adjusted, and any lot elevation increase achieved by mounding the
proposed sign location shall be subtracted from the maximum
allowable sign height. When a proposed sign will be readable from
multiple roads, the greatest sign height resulting from application
of this section shall be permitted.

a zoning permit and certificate of occupancy for such new or different use;
the failure to comply with any other provisions of this chapter; and the
violation of any condition imposed upon the grant of a special exception or
variance by the Zoning Hearing Board or by a court, conditional use by the
Board of Commissioners or accord of competent jurisdiction if such special
exception, variance or conditional use is granted by such court are hereby
declared to be violations of this chapter.
C. A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by such
proposal.
D. A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question and an accurate description of the present improvements and
the alterations intended to be made under this application, indicating
the size and use of such proposed improvements and general
construction thereof. In addition, there shall be attached a plot plan of
the real estate to be affected, as required to accompany applications for
permits, indicating the location and size of the lot and location of
improvements now erected and Aproposed to be erected thereon.
E. A statement of the section of this chapter under which the appeal or
application requested may be allowed and reasons why it should be
granted or a statement of the section of this chapter governing the
situation in which the alleged erroneous ruling is being appealed and
reasons for the appeal.
F. Any other pertinent data required by the Zoning Hearing Board,
Township Board of Commissioners and/or Zoning Officer, as
appropriate to their individual authorities set forth in this article.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When written notice of a violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter has been served by the Zoning Officer on the owner, agent
or occupant or contractor, such violation shall be discontinued
immediately.
§ 220-267 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-268
216:896
(2) All appeals from determinations by the Zoning Officer under this
section shall be made to the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days
of the date of the determination.
B. Causes of action. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is
or is proposed to be erected, constructed, excavated, reconstructed,
altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the
Township Board of Commissioners or, with the approval of the Township
Board of Commissioners, an officer of the Township, or any aggrieved
owner or tenant of real property who shows that his property or person
will be substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to
other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure or
landscaping of land or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act,
conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When any such action
is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be
served upon the Township at least 30 days prior to the time the action is
begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the Township Board of
Commissioners. No such action may be maintained until such notice
has been given.
C. Enforcement remedies.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
or permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than
$500, plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial District
Judge, determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good faith basis for person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge, and, thereafter, each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs
and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation shall be
paid over to Lower Allen Township.
(2) The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

development not involving applications under Article V or Article
VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
C. Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances
where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning Hearing Board may, by rule,
prescribe the form of application and may require application to the
Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance,
provided that the following findings are made where relevant in a given
case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefor necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the district in which the property is located nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
257. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10912.1.
258. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 220-269 (RESERVED) § 220-269
216:899
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue. In granting any variance, the
Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this chapter.
D. Special exceptions. In this chapter, special exceptions may be granted
or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to expressed
standards and criteria contained in this chapter. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in
accordance with such standards and criteria and prescribe the
application form to be used. The Board may grant approval of a special
exception, provided that the applicant complies with the following
standards and that the proposed special exception shall not be
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the neighborhood. The
burden of proof shall rest with the applicant.
(1) The applicant shall establish, by credible evidence, compliance
with all conditions on the special exception contained within this
chapter which give the applicant the right to seek the special
exception.
(2) The applicant shall establish, by credible evidence, that the
proposed special exception shall be properly serviced by all
existing public service systems. The peak traffic and parking
demands generated by the subject of the application shall be
accommodated in a safe and efficient manner or improvements
shall be made in order to effect the same. Similar responsibilities
shall be assumed with respect to other public service systems,
including, but not limited to police protection, fire protection,
utilities, and parks and recreational facilities.
(3) The applicant shall establish, by credible evidence, that the
proposed special exception shall be in and of itself properly
designed with regard to internal circulation, parking, buffering and
all other elements of proper design as specified in this chapter and
any other governing law or regulation.
(4) The applicant shall provide the Board with sufficient plans, studies
or other data to demonstrate compliance with all applicable
regulations.
(5) For uses, structures or any development within the overlay
Floodway (FW) and Flood-Fringe (FF) Districts, the applicant shall
present evidence of the effect of the use, structure or development
on flood levels, flood frequencies and velocities; the susceptibility
of the use, structure or development to flood damage; the
availability of emergency access to the use, structure or
development in times of flood; the necessity of the use, structure or
development to be located near the floodplain; and the compliance
§ 220-269 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-269
216:900
with the requirement that the use, structure or development will
not be located in the floodplain if the use, structure or development
increases the base flood elevation.
(6) The applicant shall inform the Board whether any structures on the
property are listed upon the National Register of Historic Places or
any other registry of historic structures.
(7) The proposed special exception shall not substantially injure or
detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character
of the neighborhood and the use of property adjacent to the area
included in the special exception application shall be adequately
safeguarded.
(8) The Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards
as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of and ensure
compliance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended, and this chapter, which conditions may include plantings
and buffers, harmonious designs of buildings and the elimination of
noxious, offensive or hazardous elements.
(9) Unless otherwise specified by the Board or by law, a special
exception shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain a zoning
permit within 12 months from the date of authorization thereof by
the Board or by the court if such special exception has been
granted after an appeal or fails to complete any erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or change in use
authorized by the special exception approval within one year from
the date of authorization thereof by the Board or by the court if
such special exception has been granted after an appeal. The
Board, upon written application and for reasonable cause shown,
may extend the approval for an additional period of up to one year.
(10) Any site plan or plot plan presented in support of the special
exception shall become an official part of the record for said special
exception. Approval of any special exception shall also bind the use
in accordance with the submitted site plan or plot plan. Should a
change in the site plan or plot plan be required as a part of the
approval of the use, the applicant shall revise the site plan or plot
plan prior to the issuance of a zoning permit and present such
revised plan to the Zoning Officer. Any subsequent change to the
use on the subject property not reflected on the originally approved
site plan or the amended site plan filed with the Zoning Officer
prior to the issuance of the zoning permit shall require the granting
of another special exception to authorize such change.
(11) The Zoning Hearing Board's decision to grant a permit for a special
exception use shall be made only after public notice and public
hearing. Such permit shall apply specifically to the application and
plans submitted and presented at said public hearing. Any
§ 220-269 (RESERVED) § 220-269
216:901
subsequent amendments or additions shall be subject to review and
public hearing by the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception.
(12) If the Zoning Hearing Board requests a report from the Planning
Commission pursuant to § 220-266, then no application for a permit
shall be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board for any special
exception use until said Board has first received and considered an
advisory report thereon from the Planning Commission with
respect to the location of such use in relation to the needs and
growth pattern of the Township of Lower Allen, where appropriate,
with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the
arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street
loading and unloading spaces and other pertinent features of the
proposal.
(13) The Planning Commission shall have 30 days from the date of its
receipt of the application within which to file its report thereon. In
the event that the Planning Commission shall fail to file its report
within 30 days, such application may be deemed to have been
recommended approval by the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission may have representation at the public hearing held by
the Zoning Hearing Board on such application. After receipt of the
report, the Zoning Hearing Board shall hear the application in the
same manner and under the same procedure as it is empowered by
law and ordinance to hear cases and make exceptions to the
provisions of this chapter. The Zoning Hearing Board may
thereafter direct the Zoning Officer to issue a permit if, in its
judgment, the request will not be detrimental to the health, safety
and general welfare of the Township of Lower Allen.
(14) A special exception use for which a permit is granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
construed to be a conforming use.
E. Parties appellant before the Zoning Hearing Board. Appeals raising the
substantive validity of any land use ordinance, except those to be
brought before the Township Board of Commissioners, pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process or enactment or adoption of
land use ordinance; from the determination of the Zoning Officer,
including but not limited to the granting or denial of any permit or
failure to act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease-anddesist
order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming
use, structure or lot; from a determination by the Township Engineer or
Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or
flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance;
or from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Township Engineer
in the reference to sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater
management, insofar as the same relate to the development not
involving subdivision and development or planned residential
development, may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board in writing by
§ 220-269 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-269
216:902
the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Township or any
person aggrieved. Requests for a variance and for special exception
may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by any landowner or tenant
with the permission of such landowner.
F. Time limitations.
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been approved by the
Township if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or limit
the approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves
that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval has been given. If such person has succeeded to his
interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of
his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the
landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan
or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to
the validity of this chapter or an amendment hereto or map or an
amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval,
except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates
from the approved tentative approval.
(2) No issue of alleged defect in the process of enactment of any
ordinance or map or any amendment thereto shall be raised in any
proceeding filed with the Zoning Hearing Board later than 30 days
from the time such ordinance, map or amendment takes effect,
unless the person raising such issues alleges and proves that he
failed to receive adequate notice of the enactment or amendment.
If such person has succeeded to his interest after the enactment of
the ordinances, adequate notice to his predecessor in interest shall
be deemed adequate notice to him.
(3) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
G. Stay of proceedings.
(1) Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing
Board and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board,
all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order
or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body and all
official action thereunder shall be stayed, unless the Zoning Officer
or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the development or official action shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an

§ 220-270. Interpretation; construal of provisions.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the health,
safety, morals and general welfare. They are not intended to interfere with
or abrogate or annul other rules, regulations or ordinances, provided that
where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings
or premises or upon the height of a building or requires larger open spaces
than are imposed by such other rules, easements, covenants, restrictions,
regulations or ordinances, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 220-271. (Reserved)
application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly
approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other
than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as
a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
(2) After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous.
After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court
determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition
for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to
post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be
revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the
court.
(3) The question of whether or not such petition should be granted and
the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the
court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory.
An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be
interlocutory.
(4) If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post
a bond and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below
to post a bond, the respondents to the petition for a bond, upon
motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable
costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.

ARTICLE XXVIII
Floodplain Districts
§ 220-272. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to prevent the loss of property and life, the
creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and
governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of
public funds for flood protection and relief and the impairment of the tax
base of:
§ 220-273. Applicability.
This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the Township
and shown on the Township Zoning Map as being located within the
boundaries of the Floodway (FW), Flood-Fringe (FF) and General Floodplain
Conservation (FA) Districts.
§ 220-274. Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged or structurally
altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this
article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to
uses within the jurisdiction of this article.
§ 220-275. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Regulating uses, activities and development which, acting alone or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies.
B. Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development from
locating within areas subject to flooding.
C. Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in
flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding
and flood damage.
D. Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
article does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or that
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damages.
§ 220-272 (RESERVED) § 220-275
216:905
§ 220-276. Establishment of floodplain districts.
The following floodplain districts are hereby created, each differing with
respect to the intensity and nature of their flooding problems:
B. This article shall not create liability on the part of the Township or any
office or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Lower Allen
Township, subject to the one-hundred-year flood, which is identified as
Zone A (Area of Special Flood Hazard) in Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
dated March 16, 2009 and the accompanying maps or the most recent
revision thereof as issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. Floodplain districts.
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is delineated for purposes of this article
using the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain must be
capable of carrying the waters of the one-hundred-year flood
without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more
than one foot at any point. The district is shown on the Township
Zoning Map. The areas included in this district are specifically
defined in Table 1 of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study
and shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map.
(2) The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that area of the one-hundred-year
floodplain not included in the Floodway District (FW). The basis for
the outermost boundary of this district shall be the one-hundredyear-
flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above
referenced Flood Insurance Study.
(3) The General Floodplain Conservation District (FA) is the floodplain
area for which no specific flood profiles have been provided. It is
designated as Zone A on the maps accompanying the abovereferenced
Flood Insurance Study. Where the specific one-hundredyear-
flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other
sources of data such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers
Floodplain Information Reports, United States Geological Survey
Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc., the applicant for the proposed use,
development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in
accordance with the hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
technique. This elevation information shall be subject to review by
the municipality and other agency that it shall designate, such as
the Corps of Engineers, the Department of Environmental
Protection, the River Basin Commission, etc. Flood elevations for
Cedar Run for the one-hundred-year flood have been provided by
§ 220-275 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-276
216:906
§ 220-277. District provisions.
and shall be obtained from the Township Engineer where not
inconsistent with the maps accompanying the above-referenced
Flood Insurance Study.
(4) FE (Special Floodplain Area): the areas identified as Zone AE in the
Flood Insurance Study, where one-hundred-year flood elevations
have been provided, but no floodway has been delineated.
C. Overlay concept.
(1) The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to the
existing underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning
Ordinance Map, and as such, the provisions for these three districts
shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. All
such districts shall be designated on the Township Zoning Map by
the Township Engineer.
(2) Where there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements
of any of the floodplain districts and those of any underlying
district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
(3) In the event that any portion of the floodplain districts be declared
inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions
or judicial discretion, the underlying zoning applicable to such land
or use shall be deemed to be the district in which it is located
without consideration of this article.
D. Zoning Map. The boundaries of the floodplain districts are established
as shown on the Zoning Map of the Township which is declared to be a
part of this article and which shall be kept on file at the Township
Municipal Building.
E. District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
districts may be revised by the Board of Commissioners where natural
or man-made changes have occurred or more detailed studies conduced
or undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
Susquehanna River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
F. Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the Township
Engineer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of the
districts, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary
determination with the recommendations of the Township Engineer.
The person questioning or contesting the location of the district
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to
the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
§ 220-276 (RESERVED) § 220-277
216:907
A. All uses, activities and development occurring within any floodplain
district shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the
provisions of this article and with all other applicable provisions of the
Code of the Township of Lower Allen. For purposes of this section, the
word "development" shall also mean "any man-made change to
improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to
buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation, installation of drainage facilities or drilling operations."
B. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity or development
adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any
watercourse, drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system.
C. Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream of any
watercourse, stream, etc., within the Township, a permit shall be
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection. Further,
notification of the proposal shall be given to all affected adjacent
municipalities and state coordinating offices. Copies of such notification
shall be forwarded to both the Federal Insurance Administration and
the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development (DCED).
D. Floodway District (FW). In the Floodway District (FW), no use, activity
or development shall be permitted, except where the effect of such on
flood heights is fully offset by accompanying stream improvements
which have been approved by all appropriate local and/or state
authorities as required above.
(1) Permitted uses. In the Floodway District (FW), the following uses,
activities or developments are permitted, provided that they are in
compliance with the provisions of the underlying district, are not
prohibited by any other article and provided that they do not
require structures, fill or storage of materials and equipment:
(a) Agricultural uses, such as general farming, pastures, grazing,
outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, forestry,
sod farming and wild crop harvesting.
(b) Public and private recreational uses and activities, such as
parks, day camps, picnic grounds, golf courses, boat-launching
and swimming areas, hiking and horseback riding trails,

§ 220-279 (RESERVED) § 220-280
216:911
the Board shall, prior to rendering a decision thereon, require
the applicant to furnish such of the following information as is
deemed necessary by the Board for determining the suitability of
the particular site for the proposed use, activity or development:
(a) Plans in triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the nature,
location, dimensions and elevation of the lot, existing
floodproofing measures and the relationship of the above to the
location of the floodway and one-hundred-year flood.
(b) A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the
stream or watercourse, dimensions and elevation of floodway
and one-hundred-year flood areas and adjoining each side of
the channel and cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the
proposed use, activity or development.
(c) A plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground: pertinent structural, fill or storage elevations; size,
location and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing
structures on the site; location and elevation of all proposed
and existing structures on the site; location and elevation of
streets, water supply, sanitary facilities, photographs showing
existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream,
soil types and other pertinent information.
(d) A profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream or watercourse.
(e) Specifications for building construction and materials,
floodproofing, filling, dredging, grading, channel
improvements, storage of materials, water supply and sanitary
facilities.
(2) The Board may, on its own initiative, retain the services of a
registered professional engineer for evaluation purposes, and, if
necessary, the Board shall transmit to such engineer one copy of
the information described herein for the purpose of obtaining his
evaluation of the proposed project with regard to potential flood
damage to the use, the magnitude of related floodplain
encroachment and other relevant matters.
(3) Based upon the technical evaluation by the designated engineer,
the Board shall determine the specific flood hazard at the site of the
proposed use or development for which a variance or special
exception is being applied and shall evaluate the suitability of the
proposed use in relation to the flood hazard.
C. Factors to be considered.
(1) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
§ 220-280 LOWER ALLEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 220-280
216:912
(2) The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
(4) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners.
(5) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(6) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
(7) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
(8) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
(9) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
(10) The safety of access to the property in times of flood of ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at this site.
(12) Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
article.
D. Variances can be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places where appropriate.
E. Variances shall not be given in the floodway that result in any increase
in flood levels during the one-hundred-year flood.
F. Variances may be given for new construction and substantial
improvements on lots 1/2 acre or less in size, surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the one-hundred-year flood level.
G. Where variances are given for an activity described in Subsection F
herein, written notification signed by the Zoning Officer shall be given
to the applicant, indicating that:
(1) Increased insurance premiums will result.
(2) Construction occurring below the one-hundred-year-flood level will
increase risks to life and property.
H. Conditions attached to special exceptions or variances. Upon
consideration of the factors listed above and the purpose of this article,
