§ 31-1. Adoption.
The following Code of Ethics is hereby adopted by the Borough Council of the Borough of Pleasant
Hills:
CODE OF ETHICS
Preamble
We believe that responsible representative government is the best form of government for the
American People.
We believe that government in the United States of America requires a positive spirit of cooperation
among the people's servants at the municipal, state and federal levels.
We believe that effective representative government in our municipalities is necessary to the
preservation of the vitality of freedom in our nation.
We believe that each and every public servant, elected or appointed in the field of local government
bears part of the responsibility for the maintenance of true representative government.
We consider public service to be at once a responsibility and an honor; we will make every effort, in
our conduct in office, to be worthy of both the responsibility and the honor.
While recognizing the necessity of laws to protect the public against the unjust steward, we
acknowledge that the people deserve more of a public servant than mere adherence to laws against
criminal behavior and civil misdemeanor. We promise therefore to conduct our public lives according
to the highest ethical standard. We promise not only to avoid what is legally wrong, but to seek out
and to do what is ethically right.
In keeping with this general undertaking, we promise to abide by the Code of Ethics of the
Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs.
Code of Ethics
1. We shall learn the laws governing the conduct of officials and employees of Boroughs in
Pennsylvania, and we shall faithfully observe their letter and their spirit.
2. We shall constantly endeavor to enlarge our understanding of Borough government and to
improve our competence in the performance of our functions.
3. In all matters that come before us in our official capacities, our first concern shall be to
advance the public interest to the maximum.
4. If at any time we are aware that we have, or may reasonably be considered to have, a direct
or indirect private interest in any proposed official action of the Borough, we shall disclose
publicly the nature and extent of our interest.
5. In our contacts with other persons and groups, we shall conduct ourselves in keeping with the
trust and dignity reposing in our positions as servants of the people of our Borough; we shall
take care to guard not only the reality but also the appearance of justice and integrity.
6. We shall place the competence and effectiveness of the public service before the interests of
persons, factions and parties.
7. We shall obey and abide by the policies duly established by the Council; we shall adhere to
and enforce standard rules and procedures for performance of the functions of Borough
government.

A.
Code of Ethics
8. We shall not make available to any person any services, tangible or intangible, that are not
equally available under the law to any other citizen.
9. We shall not use to our own personal advantage nor to the advantage of persons related to us
by family, friendship or business, confidential information to which we have access by virtue of
our public offices.
10. We shall refuse personal gifts in every instance where we have reason to believe the gift
would not have been extended to us except for our official position, where we have reason to
believe that the giver's interests are likely to be affected by our official actions, or where the
gift is, or may reasonably be considered to be, designed to influence our official actions.
11. In any transaction, negotiation or litigation to which the Borough is a party, we shall not
represent private interests, nor shall we convey to private interests any information or advice
not generally available to the public.
12. We shall not use, nor permit others to use, the power of our offices to solicit contributions from
municipal employees on behalf of any candidate for political office; nor shall we demand that
any municipal employee solicit contributions on behalf of any candidate for political office.

This definition shall apply to alarms which are generated by other than a legitimate emergency.
This definition shall include, but not be limited to a faulty and/or defective alarm system, and also
include alarms generated by a system without adequate battery backup to prevent false alarms.
For purposes of this section, the police department and fire department shall maintain a record of
such alarms separately. For purposes of enforcement of this section, each false alarm shall count
as one false alarm per occurrence, regardless of the number of different emergency departments
required to respond.
§ 138-5. Determination of false alarm and requirement for
property owner to address the situation.
[Amended 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 1013]
The determination of whether an alarm which is responded to constitutes a false alarm is a
determination made by the first responder and the determination of the police department or fire
department who have responded to the alarm shall be final. The record owner of the property in the
Borough of Pleasant Hills shall be responsible to comply with the requirements of this article. Should

Chickens shall be housed in a chicken coop which has access to a chicken pen. From dusk to

Construction and design of chicken coop. The chicken coop shall comply with all applicable
setback requirements for residential accessory uses and structures. The setback requirements
that apply to sheds shall also apply to chicken coops, and no chicken coops shall be erected any
closer to the property line than a shed or accessory structure is permitted to be placed. The coop

coop shall be at least 18 inches high and provide at least 2.5 square feet of floor area per chicken.
The coop shall provide no less than one square foot of window per coop, with at least one square
foot of window per 15 square feet of floor. In addition, the coop shall provide vents as necessary to
ensure adequate ventilation. The materials for each element (walls, roof, windows and doors) shall
be uniform and blend with the surrounding area. Doors shall be constructed so that they can close
and lock. Windows shall be constructed so they can close. Windows and vents shall be covered
with wire mesh with a maximum spacing of one inch by one inch. The coop shall be impermeable
to rodents, wild birds, dogs, cats, and other predators. The coop shall provide adequate shelter
from moisture and extremes of temperatures. Existing accessory structures may be used as
chicken coops, provided they meet the standards set forth herein.
Construction and design of chicken pen. The chicken pen shall be constructed of wood or metal
posts with wire mesh fencing material (wire mesh with a maximum spacing of one inch by one
inch). The pen shall contain at least 10 square feet of area per chicken. The fence shall rise at
least four feet above the ground and be buried at least one foot below the ground. The pen shall
be covered with wire mesh, aviary netting or solid roofing. The pen shall serve as an area for the
chickens to run, yet prevent the chickens from running loose or becoming a nuisance. Chickens
that are permitted to run loose shall be considered a violation of this article.
Maintenance of chicken coop, chicken pen and surrounding area. The chicken coop, chicken pen
and surrounding area shall be kept clean, dry and odor-free, and in a neat and sanitary condition
at all times. All manure, uneaten feed and other trash shall be removed in a timely manner and

chicken(s) and/or constructing the coop or pen. All applicable permits for the accessory structure
(i.e., the coop) must also be obtained. Every Borough resident who currently has chickens must
apply for and be approved for a permit in order to keep the chickens they currently have, with up
to a maximum of six chickens. The residential chicken permit application shall be on a form
established by the Borough Manager and/or Zoning Officer and may be amended from time to
time. If the Zoning Officer or designee determines that the residential chicken permit application is
administratively complete, the Zoning Officer will issue a conditional approval of the residential
chicken permit application. After the applicant receives conditional approval, the applicant must
notify the Zoning Officer when the chicken coop and chicken pen have been placed on the subject
property and are ready for inspection. If, upon inspection, the Zoning Officer or his/her designee
determines that the chickens will be kept in compliance with the requirements of this article, a final
residential chicken permit shall be issued to the applicant. All permit applications must be filed with
the Borough no later than the effective date of this article. Following the effective date of this
article, it shall be a violation of this article to obtain or house chickens in the Borough of Pleasant
Hills, except those individuals who previously obtained the necessary permit to house up to six
chickens.
Residential chicken permits shall only be valid for three years after the date of issuance. A
permittee and/or co-permittee who wishes to continue keeping chickens shall apply for a new
residential chicken permit on or before the expiration date of the previous residential chicken
permit. Applications for a new residential chicken permit shall be reviewed in accordance with the
procedures and requirements that are applicable at the time the person applies for a new
residential chicken permit. An inspection by the Borough will be required prior to the residential
chicken permit renewal, to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article, which inspection
is a condition precedent to the issuance of a new residential chicken permit.
Notwithstanding the issuance of a residential chicken permit by the Borough, private restrictions
on the use of land/property shall remain enforceable as provided by law, and the Borough's
issuance of a residential chicken permit does not remove or supersede private restrictions in
effect. No person shall make application for a residential chicken permit who knows, or has reason
to know, that private restrictions prohibit the keeping of chickens. Private restrictions include but
are not limited to: rental contracts, deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions,
neighborhood associations' bylaws, and covenant deeds. A residential chicken permit issued to a
person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens is
void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the
private parties involved.
§ 150-33. Application requirements, process and procedure.
A residential chicken permit application shall be submitted on the form established by the Borough
Manager and/or Zoning Officer and at a minimum shall contain the following information:
A notarized signature of the landowner of the subject property;
The notarized signature of any lessee or tenant who will be responsible for the keeping of
chickens (co-permittee);
The address of the subject property;
A verification that, to the owner's knowledge, there is no private restriction against the
keeping of chickens;
A verification that the applicant is familiar with and agrees to be bound by the requirements
set forth in this article for the keeping of chickens.
The Borough Council shall from time to time establish by resolution an application fee for the
residential chicken permit application for the keeping of chickens. The application shall be

accompanied by the applicable fee, and the application will not be processed until the fee has
been paid. The initial fee for the application is set at $50. Thereafter, the application fee may be
amended from time to time at the discretion of Borough Council. The amount of the application fee
will be included in the Fee Resolution that is adopted by Borough Council.
A separate permit may be required for all accessory structures associated with the keeping of
chickens, and no such structure may be erected without the permit for the accessory structure first
being obtained.
§ 150-34. Responsibilities of permittee and co-permittee.
A person engaged in the keeping of chickens on his/her property shall comply with all of the following:
Such person shall have been issued the residential chicken permit required under this article.
Such person shall keep no more than six female chickens.
The principal use of the property must remain as a residential dwelling.
No person shall keep a rooster(s).
The chickens shall at all times be provided a chicken coop and chicken pen in accordance with
this article.
A person shall not keep chickens in any location on the property other than the rear yard. For the
purpose of this article, "rear yard" means that portion of a lot enclosed by the property's rear lot
line and the side lot lines to the points where the side lot lines intersect with an imaginary line
established by the rear of the single-family structure and extending to the side lot lines.
Notwithstanding the applicable residential accessory setbacks, the chicken coop and chicken pen
shall be located no closer than 30 feet to any residential structure on an adjacent property. For the
purposes of this section, "adjacent property" means all parcels of property that the applicant's
property comes into contact with at one or more points, except for parcels that are legally adjacent
to, but are in fact separated from, the applicant's property by a public or private street.
All feed and other items associated with the keeping of chickens that are likely to attract or to
become infested with or infected by rats, mice, or other rodents shall be protected so as to prevent
rats, mice, or other rodents from gaining access to or coming into contact with them.
If the above requirements or any other requirements of this article are not complied with, the Code
Enforcement Officer and/or Zoning Officer may revoke any permit granted under this article and/or
initiate appropriate actions at law or equity to abate or restrain the violation.
A person who has been issued a residential chicken permit shall make such permit available for
examination upon demand by any police officer, the Code Enforcement Officer, the Zoning Officer,
the Borough Manager or any other employees of the Borough of Pleasant Hills.
Permittees and co-permittees shall be jointly and severally liable for compliance with the
provisions of this Code.
§ 150-35. Permit revocation; removal of items.
Compliance with the requirements of this article shall create a presumption that the permitted
keeping of chickens does not create a public nuisance or threat to public health or safety under
the nuisance provisions of this Code.[1] The residential chicken permit shall, however, be revoked

in the initiation of the enforcement proceedings and the assessment of the penalties described

voided, or denied.
If a violation of this article occurs, the Zoning Officer is authorized to order the immediate removal
of all disposable items associated with the keeping of chickens. Stationary structures associated
with the keeping of chickens may remain, provided the structure is not creating a nuisance and is
not in violation of any provision of the Code of the Borough of Pleasant Hills.
Any permittee or co-permittee who has a residential chicken permit revoked, removed, or voided
will not be eligible for consideration for another residential chicken permit in the future.
§ 150-36. Permits obtained through misrepresentation, fraud or
forgery.
If the applicant obtained the residential chicken permit through misrepresentation, fraud, or forgery, the
permit shall automatically become null and void. Such a determination shall be made by the Zoning
Officer, and the determination of the Zoning Officer shall be considered final.
§ 150-37. Nuisances prohibited.
The permitted keeping of chickens shall be conducted in a manner that does not disturb the use or
enjoyment of adjacent properties. Odor generated by the chickens shall not be perceptible at the
property boundaries, and noise generated by the chickens shall not disturb people of reasonable
sensitivity at the property boundaries. A permittee or co-permittee shall not, under any circumstance,
keep chickens in a manner which constitutes a public nuisance or results in a violation of Chapter 247
or 248 of the Borough Code of the Borough of Pleasant Hills or any other ordinance or law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 150-38. Appeal process.
If any applicant, permittee, co-permittee, or landowner adjacent to a permitted chicken coop or chicken
pen is aggrieved by the determination of the Zoning Officer or his/her designee or the Code
Enforcement Officer, such aggrieved person may appeal the determination to the Borough Council of
the Borough of Pleasant Hills. The appeal shall be in writing and must be received at the Borough
office no later than 20 days from the date of the determination of which such person(s) are aggrieved.
A timely appeal shall stay any order to remove chickens until the determination of the appeal, unless
the order specifies that it was issued due to the keeping of chickens causing an immediate public
health or safety hazard. The written appeal must describe in detail the reason for appeal. The Borough
Council may then notify the aggrieved person of when the matter will be considered by Council at a
public meeting. Any decision of Council shall be final and binding.

Subdivision and land development  See Ch. 322.
Zoning  See Ch. 374.
Editor's Note: This ordinance superseded former Ch. 216, Floodplain Management, adopted 2-2-1977
by Ord. No. 534, as amended.
Article I. Statutory Authorization
§ 216-1. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978,[1] delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of their
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Pleasant Hills does hereby order as follows.
Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
Article II. General Provisions
§ 216-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents by
preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 216-3. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough of Pleasant Hills
unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 216-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 216-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter shall be declared
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the
Chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter
are hereby declared to be severable.
§ 216-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of Pleasant Hills or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Article III. Administration
§ 216-7. Designation of Floodplain Administrator.
The Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this chapter and is referred to
herein as the "Floodplain Administrator." The Floodplain Administrator may: A) fulfill the duties and
responsibilities set forth in these regulations, B) delegate duties and responsibilities set forth in
these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and other
employees, or C) enter into a written agreement or written contract with another agency or private
sector entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations. Administration of any part of
these regulations by another entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant
to the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code
of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator duties are to
be fulfilled by the Borough Manager.
§ 216-8. Permits required.
A permit shall be required before any construction or development is undertaken within any area of the
Borough of Pleasant Hills.

does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request,
and the original permit is compliant with this chapter and the FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.
§ 216-15. Enforcement.
Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized municipal representative
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any
provisions of this chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
Be in writing;
Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for the performance of any act it
requires;
Be served upon the property owner or his/her agent, as the case may require; provided,
however, that such notice or order shall be deemed to have been properly served upon such
owner or agent when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other method
authorized or required by the laws of this state;

§ 216-17. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Borough of Pleasant Hills, classified as special
flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are
hereby adopted by Borough of Pleasant Hills and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 216-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,

the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the municipality.
§ 216-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as
soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a
community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or
scientific data. See § 216-21B for situations where FEMA notification is required.
§ 216-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Borough of Pleasant Hills, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 216-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article V. Technical Provisions
§ 216-22. General requirements.
Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development that
causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in

to installing culverts and bridges):
The applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12) apply to FEMA for conditional approval of
such action prior to permitting the encroachments to occur.
Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior to approving
the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide as-built
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in
accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any identified floodplain area
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 216-23. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
Residential structures.
In A Zones, where there are no base flood elevations specified on the FIRM, any new
construction or substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation determined in accordance with § 216-
18A(1) of this chapter.

conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, and to achieve the objectives of this chapter.
Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough of Pleasant Hills shall notify the applicant in
writing that:
The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.
Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
In reviewing any request for a variance, the Borough of Pleasant Hills shall consider, at a
minimum, the following:
That there is good and sufficient cause.
That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
That the granting of the variance will:
Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; nor
Create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the public, or conflict with any other
applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by the
Borough of Pleasant Hills. In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall
be included in the annual report to FEMA.

§ 222-2. Scope; administration.
This chapter concerns new grading, excavation and fills; and changes, additions or alterations
made in existing excavations, fills and embankments which shall conform to the provisions of this
chapter.
The Borough Council shall designate an Administrator for review, approval and granting of grading
permits and to make inspections of the grading work.
A separate grading permit shall be required for each site. One permit shall cover all grading,
excavation, and any fills made on the same site.
Only one permit shall be required for the grading of a large continuous parcel of land for a major
planned development, such as a planned subdivision development or a planned commercial
development, when the standards for the grading of the entire parcel are satisfactory to and
approved by the Administrator.
Unless the project qualifies for an exception pursuant to § 222-3 of the Code of the Borough of
Pleasant Hills, an approved site plan and grading permit shall be required before a building permit
may be issued. In all cases, applications for grading permits and/or building permits will not be
accepted and the time for a decision will not begin to run until the applicant first submits each and
every document required for consideration and approval.
[Amended 2-16-2009 by Ord. No. 899]
All grading, excavations and fills, whether or not a grading permit is required, shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 222-3. Exceptions.
A grading permit shall not be required for any of the following:
An excavation which does not exceed three feet in vertical depth at its deepest point measured
from the natural ground surface and cover a surface area of less than 1,000 square feet, provided
that the surfaces of such excavation do not have slope at any point steeper than four horizontal to
one vertical. However, this subsection shall not be deemed to nullify the application of this chapter,
or any requirement for obtaining a grading permit, with respect to any fill made with material from
such an excavation, unless otherwise excepted by Subsections B and C of this section.

Provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance are incorporated herein by
reference.
§ 222-7. Responsibility of the administrator.
The Administrator shall require that a geotechnical engineering report be submitted by the
applicant if the site is, has been, or is likely to become hazardous to persons or property. The
overlay maps such as the Coal Resource Maps prepared by USGS, 1975, for the Greater
Pittsburgh Region shall be used to locate hazardous areas. The report shall contain a detailed
description of the geological conditions of the site and shall include conclusions and
recommendations that will demonstrate the relationship of the geological conditions to the
proposed development, including hazardous conditions, water resources, mineral resources and
environmental impact.
In special cases, when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil, or rock fall prone areas as
recognized by the soil survey, or other standard surveys, the Administrator may require special
precautions prior to issuing a permit from the applicant. The results of all soil tests and core
borings made relative to the site shall be submitted to the Administrator.
The Administrator may deny a grading permit if the use of land to be graded, either excavation or
filling, is not specifically known except for the intent of improving the site. The Administrator shall
review the application, plans specifications and reports and determine whether the project will
improve the site, is in the best interest of the Borough, and is not detrimental to the environment.
The applicant may appeal the Administrator's decision to the Council by preparing and submitting
to the Council a site plan showing the development of the land in accordance with the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance.
When the requirements of this chapter for obtaining a permit have been met, the Administrator
shall approve the application and proposed plan and grant a grading permit to the applicant.
The Administrator may waive the requirement of any of all plans and specifications listed in this
chapter, if he finds that the information on the application is sufficient to show that the work will
conform to the provisions of this chapter.
§ 222-8. Special agreement for large projects.
In the event that the applicant will move or grade an area of more than 50,000 square feet, or grade
more than 10,000 cubic yards, then a formal agreement may be required by Borough Council, and said
agreement will be prepared by the applicant at his own cost and expense, and must be approved as to
form by the Borough Solicitor.
§ 222-9. Expiration of permit.
Every grading permit shall expire and become null and void if the work authorized by said permit has
not been commenced within six months or is not completed within one year from the date of issue;
provided that the Administrator may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a
reasonable extension of time; and provided, further, that the application for the extension of time is
made before the date of expiration of the permit.
§ 222-10. Denial of permit.

If the Administrator shall determine that the work proposed by the applicant is likely to endanger
any property or person, or any street or alley, or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit
shall be denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger property or streets
or alleys, or create hazardous conditions, the Administrator shall consider, among other relevant
factors, the following: possible saturation by rains, earth movements, surface water runoff, and
subsurface conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, aquifers, mine conditions,
springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
Any person who is aggrieved by the application of the provisions of this chapter may within 15
days from the date of the denial of the permit or such other adverse determination by the
Administrator, file a written appeal therefrom to the Borough Council. The Council shall grant a
hearing upon such an appeal within 30 days after the receipt of the written appeal.
If any appeal is taken from the issuance of a building permit where a grading permit has also been
issued and if such appeal shall, pursuant to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, operate as a
stay of all proceedings under any such building permit, then such appeal shall also operate to stay
all proceedings under any such grading permit.
§ 222-11. Inspections.
The Administrator shall make the inspections thereinafter required and shall either approve that
portion of the work which has been completed or notify the permit holder wherein the same fails to
comply with provisions of this chapter.
Grading and drainage plans approved by the Administrator shall be maintained at the site during
the progress of the grading and drainage and until the work has been approved.
The permit holder shall submit to the Administrator an "as built" drawing of the project before the
issuance of a grading certificate of completion.
The permit holder shall notify the Administrator in order to obtain inspections in accordance with
the following schedule and such notification shall be made by the permit holder at least 24 hours
before the inspection is to be made:
Initial inspection: when work is about to be commenced and stake out is completed.
Rough grading: when all rough grading has been completed.
Drainage facilities:
All drainage facilities that connect to or shall become public drainage facilities shall be
continuously inspected during construction.
Other drainage facilities shall be inspected before such facilities are backfilled.
Additional inspection: when in the opinion of the Administrator other inspections are
necessary.
Final inspection: when all work, including the installation of all drainage, landscaping and
other structures has been completed.
If at any stage of the work the Administrator shall determine by inspection that the nature of the
excavation or fills is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger
any property, or streets, or alleys, or create hazardous conditions, the Administrator may require,
as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken
as the Administrator considers acceptable to avoid such likelihood of danger.

§ 222-12. Plan changes.
Any physical changes from the original plan uncovered in the site during the construction, such as
surface water drainage, soil and bedrock dislocations, alteration of ground water discharge or any
other natural or man-made modification which would tend to undermine the basis upon which the
permit was issued, must be immediately reported to the Administrator by the permit holder. If the
circumstances dictate, the Administrator shall revoke the permit or otherwise modify the conditions
upon which the permit was initially issued.
§ 222-13. Fees and bonds.
At the time of application the applicant shall pay an application review fee to cover the Borough
cost of reviewing application documents. Any additional charges incurred by the Borough to
review the application of an excavation permit shall be borne by the applicant. Any application
fees not expended by the Borough shall be returned to the applicant within a reasonable period of
time.
Fees for review of application and inspections of regular grading permits shall be in accordance
with the current Fees Resolution of the Borough of Pleasant Hills, on file in the office of the
Borough Secretary.
[Amended 4-16-2001 by Ord. No. 792]
Fees for review of application and inspections of engineered grading permits shall be in
accordance with the current Fees Resolution of the Borough of Pleasant Hills, on file in the office
of the Borough Secretary.
[Amended 4-16-2001 by Ord. No. 792]
Plan checking fee;
Inspection fee: An inspection fee as set forth in the current Fees Resolution shall be collected
by the Administrator prior to the issuance of a grading permit. Inspection costs incurred by the
Borough in excess of the initial fee collected shall be paid for by the applicant prior to final
inspection of the work.
Should a special agreement be required by the Borough Council as described in § 222-8 of
this chapter, a review fee of $75 will be required.
The plan checking fee for an amendment to a grading permit authorizing additional work to that
under a valid permit shall be the difference between such fee paid for the original permit and the
fee required for the entire project; however, a minimum fee of $20 will be charged.
As a condition of approval of a grading application under this chapter, the applicant shall post a
cash or performance bond or other security acceptable to the Borough in the amount of 50% of
the estimated cost to perform the work. The cost estimate shall include the complete scope of
work needed to be performed by the applicant to comply with this chapter and shall be prepared
and certified by the applicant's engineer or architect and accepted as reasonable by the
Administrator. The Administrator shall be the final arbiter as to the reasonableness of any cost
estimates.
Upon completion of the grading work, a maintenance bond in amount of 15% of the cost estimated
as determined in Subsection E shall be posted (payable to Pleasant Hills Borough) for a period of
18 months.
No bond shall be required if another bond or approved security is posted for construction and/or
site improvements which already covers the cost of grading and other control facilities.

§ 222-14. Certificate of completion.
If, upon final inspection of the site for which a permit has been issued, it is found that the work
authorized by the grading permit has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter, a grading certificate of completion covering such work and stating that the
work is approved shall be issued to the permit holder by the Administrator.
§ 222-15. Maintenance.
The owner of any property on which an excavation or fill has been made shall maintain in good
condition and repair the excavation or fill permitted, and also all retaining walls, cribbing, drainage
structures, fences, ground cover, and other protective devices as may be a part of the permit
requirements.
The continued use of said area shall be contingent upon the proper maintenance and upkeep of
all the above-mentioned items, satisfactory to the Borough and subject to such further conditions
as the Borough may prescribe from time to time to keep the site in proper condition.
The grading certificate of completion may be revoked by the Borough Council at any time, upon
the recommendation of the Administrator, where the conditions of the permit are not being
observed, the work covered by the permit has been materially extended or altered without a permit
to do so, or conditions exist which prejudice the health, safety and welfare of any person, persons
or property. Before such revocation, the Administrator shall first give written notice to the permit
holder and to the owner of the property involved, specifying the defect or unsatisfactory condition
involved, and advising that unless such defect or unsatisfactory condition is remedied, the
certificate shall be revoked. If the defect or unsatisfactory condition is remedied within 30 days of
notice to the permit holder to correct same, the certificate shall not be revoked.

§ 222-17. Working conditions.
The following general working conditions will apply to all grading sites.
Dust control. During grading operations, acceptable measures for dust control will be exercised.
Cleanup. All soil washed or carried onto public streets during grading operations shall be cleaned
up as it accumulates. Temporary hard surface driveways or roadways surfaces shall be provided
as soon as possible. The owner of the property being graded shall be responsible to protect and
clean up lower properties of silt and debris which have washed down into the lower properties as a
result of the grading work on the higher property.
Workdays. None of the work or activity covered by a grading permit shall be conducted on a
Sunday or legal holiday.
[Amended 7-16-2007 by Ord. No. 875]
Work hours. All of the work and activity covered by a grading permit shall be conducted between
the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
[Amended 7-16-2007 by Ord. No. 875]
§ 222-18. Environmental protection.
Live stream crossings. Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams. Provision will
be made for the installation of culverts or bridges for such crossings. Permits shall be obtained
from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for temporary and permanent
encroachments, relocations, enclosures and temporary crossings of streams.
Excessive slopes. Grading on excessive slopes shall be avoided so as to minimize erosion and
storm runoff, to protect watersheds, to discourage erosion of soils by maintaining adequate foliage
cover on excessive slopes, and to promote the perpetuation of open space on hillsides. The areas
considered to have excessive slope may be revised or modified by the Borough Council where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need or possibility
for such revision.
§ 222-19. Exceptions and variances.
[Added 6-18-1990 by Ord. No. 672]
Because the land comprising the Borough of Pleasant Hills is, for the most part, hilly and of uneven
terrain, a literal enforcement of all provisions of this chapter may not always be practical or reasonable.
An applicant for a grading permit may petition Borough Council for an exception to the provisions of
this chapter or for a variance from a specific section of this chapter. The Borough Council, before
granting an exception or variance, shall cause a study to be made, at applicant's cost, to determine the
effect of such exception or variance on all the lands involved or surrounding the affected area. Upon
receipt of such study and after public hearing, Borough Council may grant exceptions and variances to
the provisions of this chapter.
Article IV. Performance and Design Standards
§ 222-20. Excavation.
All topsoil shall be removed from the area to be graded and stockpiled and preserved for possible
reuse on the site.

Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be no greater than two horizontal to one vertical for
minimizing erosion and landslide hazards. However, a governmental review agency, professional
engineer, soils engineer or engineering geologist may determine the types of soil on the sites to be
graded from the soil survey, geological surveys or core borings. Maximum slopes can then be
determined as follows:
Landslide-prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing slopes are greater than 25%
shall have proposed cut slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
Landslide-prone soils where existing slopes are less than 25% shall have proposed cut
slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical.
Soils which are not, or have a low probability of being, landslide-prone shall have a slope no
steeper than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical.
Cut slopes of up to one horizontal to one vertical may be allowed under a grading permit, provided
that two or more of the following conditions is satisfied:
The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope steeper
than the slope specified above for recognized soil conditions on the site. An acceptable
geological report signed and sealed by a soils engineer, certifying that the steeper slope will
have sufficient stability, and that it will not endanger any property, or result in property damage
and that creation of a hazard will be minimal, shall be submitted to and may be approved by
the Administrator.
A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a professional engineer and
approved by the Administrator is provided to support the face of the excavation or to provide a
fall zone at rock faced slopes.
The proposed slopes demonstrated on a site plan which is presented to the Planning
Commission and Borough Council to be absolutely necessary to permit the reasonable
development of the site, subject to other requirements of this section.
The Administrator may require that the excavation be designed so that a line having a slope of
1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical measured from the bottom of the cut slope will be entirely inside the
property lines of the property on which the excavation is made, if conditions exist which, under
applicable engineering practice, the excavation may not be deemed to be stable or safe.
The Administrator may require an excavation to be made with a cut slope flatter than those
specified above if he finds the material in which the excavation is to be made is subject to erosion,
is prone to landslides, or if other conditions exist which, under applicable engineering practices,
make such flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
Excavation adjacent to any footing, foundations or structure shall not extend below the minimum
angle of repose or natural slope of the soil under the nearest point of same unless such footing,
foundation or structure is first properly underpinned or otherwise protected against settlement.
Before commencing any excavation which will affect physically in any way an adjoining property or
structures thereon, the permit holder shall notify, in writing, the owners of the adjoining property or
structures not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made informing them excavation
is planned. A copy of such notice(s) shall be submitted to the Administrator. Adjoining properties
and structures shall be protected as provided in the Building Code and/or as required by the
Administrator.
The top or bottom edge of final slopes shall normally set back five feet from adjacent property
lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property.

No person, firm or corporation may store, handle or use any explosive in the Borough of Pleasant
Hills without first obtaining a special permit from the Administrator. The Administrator shall have
the authority to impose reasonable regulations and restrictions upon the storage, handling and use
of explosives. Any violation of any regulation or requirement imposed by the Administrator, or
imposed under any section of this chapter shall be grounds for the revocation of any permit
theretofore issued.
All blasting which is conducted in the Borough shall be in conformity with State requirements and
shall be in compliance with the Act of July 10, 1957, P.L. 685, 73 P.S. §§ 164 to 168, as amended,
and the Department of Labor and Industry Rules and Regulations promulgated pursuant to the
aforesaid statute.
The Administrator shall be notified at least 24 hours prior to any blasting.
§ 222-22. Fill and embankments.
All topsoil shall be removed from the area to be graded and stockpiled and preserved for possible
reuse on the site.
The site shall be prepared by cutting toe benches and other keyways so as to provide a firm base
on which to place the fill. No fill or embankment shall be made on landslide-prone soils without
adequate engineered preparation and drainage of the area to be filled.
No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in slope than two horizontal to
one vertical, except under one or more of the following conditions:
The fill, in the judgment of the Administrator, is located so that settlement, sliding, or erosion
of the fill material will not result in property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property,
streets, alleys, buildings, storm drains or drainage ways.
Soils capability and geological report, signed and sealed by a professional engineer,
experienced in erosion control and soils analysis, certifying that he has inspected the site and
that the proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not endanger any property or
result in property damage, and that creation of a hazard will be minimal, shall be submitted to
and may be approved by the Administrator.
The Administrator may require that an embankment or fill be constructed with an exposed surface
flatter than two horizontal to one vertical if he finds that under the particular conditions such flatter
surface is necessary for stability and safety.
Fills, embankments and finish grading shall be designed in accordance with the following:
Where fills are located so that earth movement may result in personal injury or damage to
adjacent property, streets, alleys or buildings, the bearing value and stability of the material
under proposed fills and embankments shall be determined by subsurface investigation
performed by a soils engineer or engineering geologist.
The type of fill material available in each stage of the grading operation shall be determined in
order to plan proper filling procedures.
Rock may be incorporated in fills and embankments but only in layers 24 inches thick,
maximum, as per the latest edition of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Specifications Publication 408, with voids filled and a blanket of compacted fill separating
one layer of rock from the next. Rock fill shall not be placed near the bottom of proposed
foundations, building caissons and subsurface utility installations. Suitable earth shall be
reserved or provided to cover rock fill under proposed seeded or planted areas.

No unsuitable material, such as coal, boney, red-dog, expansive shale and cinders, shall
be placed in fill areas.
Wood or other solid waste material shall not be placed in fill areas.
No fill of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps or other material which would
create a nuisance, potential fire hazard, or sanitation problem which would attract rodents,
termites or other pests.
On major fills or embankments, a toe bench shall be constructed below mantle on bedrock
under the toe of fill.
Benching of the existing surface shall be required and indicated on the cross-sections.
A porous drain shall be installed on the bottom and back wall of the toe bench; together with a
drain pipe and suitable discharge pipe to the existing nonerosive surface beyond and below
the toe of the proposed fill.
Overfilling of slopes is desirable to permit final shaping of surface to proposed grade without
the addition of loose fill over the surface of the slope, provided that no fill shall be higher than
10 feet vertically before the slope is shaped to proper grade.
At the end of each work day, the horizontal surface of the fill shall be shaped, compacted and
rolled to provide for drainage.
All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of materials and to prevent undesirable
settlement. The fill (excepting rock) shall be spread in a series of layers, each not exceeding
12 inches in thickness and shall be compacted by a sheepsfoot roller or other approved
method after each layer is spread. Fill shall be placed at the optimum moisture content for the
specified degree of compaction. The Administrator may require tests or other information if, in
his opinion, the conditions or materials are such that additional information is needed. Where
fills are to have streets structures, or public utilities placed in or on them, a modified proctor
density of 95% shall be achieved (ASTM test designation D 1557).
The top or bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back five feet from adjacent property lines
or street right-of-way lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for location of proper drainage
facilities and protective devices.
§ 222-23. Minimization of erosion and sediment.
Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook
for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, should be followed. One or a combination of guidelines
should be used to minimize hazards, depending on the site conditions and the proposed grading.
The Administrator may approve grading plans not meeting the above guidelines if the proposed
grading plans are approved by the Allegheny County Soil Conservation Service.
§ 222-24. Slope treatment and ground cover.
In order to prevent erosion, the permit holder shall be required to provide adequate ground
covering of such kind and character as may be approved by the Administrator.
For slopes steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, the ground covering shall be an approved
variety of erosion resistant vegetation.

§ 222-25. Retaining walls and fences.
[Amended 10-19-2015 by Ord. No. 986]
If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this chapter, a building permit shall not
be required. The grading permit shall include the retaining wall, and the requirements for approval
and inspections, as stated herein shall be complied with.
Retaining walls shall be designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practice.
The plans submitted for approval shall bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer.
The backfilling of retaining walls and the construction of subterranean drainage facilities shall be
done in accordance with sound engineering practice.
In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face of the wall shall be at
least three feet back from the adjoining property.
This requirement may be waived when the proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between
adjacent property owners, and documents evidencing the same are filed with the application
for the permit.
A waiver of the requirements of this section may be submitted to the Zoning Hearing Board of
the Borough of Pleasant Hills for consideration upon satisfying the filing requirements.
A fence not less than four feet in height, of a design approved by the Administrator and meeting
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance,[1] shall be placed at the top of all new cuts and fills made
when the cuts or fill slopes are steeper than two horizontal to one vertical.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 374, Zoning.
§ 222-26. Drainage facilities.
Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging the cut face of
excavations and/or the sloping surface of fills and/or adjacent properties. Interception and
diversion facilities for stormwater and surface water runoff, both above and below the cut and fill
slope areas during and after construction shall be included in the design. As a minimum, drainage
facilities to proposed detention areas shall be designed to accommodate the severest storm that
might occur during a ten-year period.
The drainage pattern prior to construction shall be indicated on the plans. Adequate measures
shall be taken to prevent any erosion and water runoff damage to adjacent properties during the
construction and after completion of construction.
Storm sewers, catch basins, drainage ditches and swales necessary to protect adjacent
properties, whether they be permanent or temporary in nature, shall be constructed before any
excavation or filling is started. The storm sewers, catch basins, drainage ditches and swales shall
be maintained, cleaned, cleared and open during construction. If the above is not complied with,
the Administrator shall stop all clearing and grading on the site until the necessary drainage
facilities are completed or the permit will be revoked and the required bond forfeited.
New storm sewers and utilities traversing a proposed fill area shall be buried a minimum of three
feet from top of pipe to proposed grade. Fill shall be constructed in that area prior to installation of
said sewers and utilities. The minimum size storm sewer exclusive of toe or bench drains, shall be

15 inches in diameter unless a variation in size is approved by the Administrator. All storm sewers
located under pavement areas shall be reinforced concrete pipe.
Slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and of more than 20 feet in vertical height shall
be separated by a level berm of at least 10 feet in width at intervals of no more than 20 feet
vertically if the slope is potentially hazardous due to easily erosive material.
On slopes of two horizontal to one vertical or less steep, the 10 feet level berms will not be
required unless deemed necessary by the Administrator.
Drainage ditches with a grade of 5% or greater shall be paved with concrete, bituminous mixture,
brick, half pipe, rubble or other hard nonerodable material.
Drainage ditches with a grade of less than 5% shall be grassed and sloped in such a manner that
they can be conveniently cut and maintained.
Drainage structures, storm sewers, detention ponds, sedimentation ponds and appurtenances
shall be of proper design and so constructed as to carry surface water and any subsurface water
encountered to the nearest practical storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the
Administrator as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters. Approval by the Administrator in
no way relieves the owner of his legal responsibilities to adjacent property owners. The owner
shall also comply with all state laws and regulations dealing with enclosing or discharging into
existing streams, channels or storm sewers.
As a guide for the prevention of damage, grading plans shall follow vegetative control methods
and ditch and conduit control methods in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The Administrator may approve methods and materials
recommended by governmental agencies, professional engineers and architects, when they are
more suitable to the site in preventing damage. Private drainage facilities of any nature shall be at
least designed to accommodate the largest size storm that would occur on the average of every
10 years. The site design shall provide a safe floodway for flows from storms of greater intensity.
No rock fill shall be placed around or over storm sewers, or drainage facilities other than that
designed as part of the site drainage facilities.
§ 222-27. Periodic inspections and maintenance of facilities.
[Added 6-18-1990 by Ord. No. 672]
The Borough Council is aware of the possibility of long time wear and tear on slope treatment and
ground cover provided in § 222-24; on retaining walls and fences provided in § 222-25 and on
drainage facilities provided in § 222-26 (collectively referred to as the "facilities"). In order to protect the
involved land and the surrounding areas with long term protection against the loss, destruction, or
deterioration of the facilities set forth in §§ 222-24, 222-25 and 222-26, the Borough Council may, at
the time of approval of any grading permit, add any or all of the following conditions to the grading
permit:
The present and any future landowner on which any of the facilities are located shall be required
to inspect the facilities at periodic intervals and submit a report of the physical condition of the
facilities to the Borough.
The present and any future landowner on which any of the facilities are located shall be required
to maintain the facilities in good repair at all times.
The present and any future landowner on which any of the facilities are located shall be required
to replace any facilities which are in such a state of disrepair that they no longer serve the purpose
intended.

In case any owner or occupant shall fail to comply with any notice to correct or abate any condition
which may adversely affect the health and welfare of the public pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, the Borough Code Enforcement Officer or Zoning Officer may elect to enter the property
and proceed to have the condition removed, corrected or abated and shall charge said owner or
occupant the actual cost to the Borough for the labor involved, the material involved, and the use
of equipment, together with a penalty of $500. Any charges remaining unpaid after 30 days'
written notice shall be turned over to the Borough Solicitor for collection in the manner provided by
law for the collection of municipal claims or in an action at law before the District Judge or the
Court of Common Pleas.
The charges described above for labor, material and equipment, together with a penalty of $500
shall only apply in the event that the Borough elects to enter the property and proceeds to have
the condition removed, corrected or abated. The Borough is not required to remediate any such
violations, but rather may elect to notify the property owner that the property owner is responsible
for such abatement of violations.
[Added 2-19-2018 by Ord. No. 1009]
In the event a violation of The International Property Maintenance Code 2009 Edition, or a

amended, has been found to occur, rather than impose the above procedure and charges, the
Borough may issue a citation for each such violation, and the fine for each violation shall be $100
per occurrence. Each day that the condition/violation continues to exist shall be recognized as a
separate violation and subject to an additional $100 per each day the violation remains. Violations
of the International Property Maintenance Code shall be determined by the requirements of the
current edition of said code in existence at the time the violation occurs.

pursuant to the following procedure:
Any person aggrieved by a decision or order issued under this code may appeal to Borough
Council within 10 days after the date of the decision, notice or order was served. Such appeal
shall be considered by Council, employing such professional assistance as Council shall, in its
sole judgment, require, within 30 days. The decision of Council shall be made within 30 days after
consideration, and the decision of Council shall be final.
In any case where Council determines the appeal is not well founded, any person aggrieved
thereby may, within 10 days thereafter or such other time as may be set by Rules of Court, appeal
therefrom by petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County as provided by law.
§ 268-6. Saving clause.

TEMPORARY EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE
A temporary statement from the Borough issued pursuant to the terms of § 298-14 of this article.
§ 298-12. Sale without evidence of compliance prohibited.
After the effective date of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell real property within
the Borough on which a building or improvement exists without first delivering to the purchaser
evidence of compliance or temporary evidence of compliance from the Borough.
After the effective date of this article, it shall be unlawful for any purchaser of real property within
the Borough on which a building or improvement exists to occupy the building or improvement
without having evidence of compliance or temporary evidence of compliance.
§ 298-13. Application for evidence of compliance.
[Amended 4-16-2001 by Ord. No. 792]
Any person (hereinafter, "applicant") selling real property within the Borough shall make application for
evidence of compliance on a form furnished by the Borough at least 14 days before the date of sale.
The applicant shall then have a plumber who is registered and licensed by the Allegheny County
Health Department perform a dye test on the real property to be sold. The plumber shall complete the
appropriate portions of the form confirming that the property has been dye tested and certifying the
results of such test. In the event that there are no illegal storm- or surface water connections, the
Compliance Officer, or his designate, shall issue evidence of compliance upon payment of a fee as set
forth in the current Fees Resolution of the Borough of Pleasant Hills, on file in the office of the Borough
Secretary. If the dye test reveals the existence of an illegal storm- or surface water connection, no
evidence of compliance will be issued until the illegal connections are removed and certification of
such removal by a registered licensed plumber is received.
§ 298-14. Temporary evidence of compliance.
Temporary evidence of compliance may be issued at the Borough's sole discretion when, either:
The applicant proves that dye testing cannot be performed because of weather conditions. In this
case, the applicant shall provide the Borough with security in the amount of $200 to guarantee that
the dye test will be performed. The applicant will cause the dye test to be performed within 14
days of written notification from the Borough, which will be given at such time as weather
conditions make the dye test possible. In addition, the applicant shall provide the Borough with a
signed, written acknowledgment from the purchaser agreeing to correct, at the purchaser's sole
expense, any violations discovered as a result of subsequent dye tests. Nothing in this subsection
shall prohibit any purchaser from requiring the applicant to reimburse the purchaser for any costs
incurred; provided, however, that primary liability for correction of any illegal connection shall run
with the land and no agreement between the applicant and the purchaser shall affect the
Borough's enforcement powers or excuse the current owner from performance; or
When an illegal storm- or surface water connection is discovered and the necessary remedial
activities to correct such connection would require a length of time such as to create a practical
hardship for the applicant, applicant may apply to the Compliance Officer for temporary evidence
of compliance which may only be issued when the applicant provides the Borough with all of the
following:
A bona fide executed contract between the applicant and a registered licensed plumber
legally requiring the plumber to complete the necessary remedial work and granting the
Borough the legal power to enforce the contract;

Cash security in the amount of said contract is posted with the Borough; and
An agreement by the purchaser to be responsible for all cost overruns related to the remedial
work together with a license to enter upon the property to complete the work in case of default
by the contractor. The Compliance Officer shall determine when such temporary evidence of
compliance shall expire, and the applicant and the purchaser shall be advised of the
expiration date. Upon expiration of the temporary evidence of compliance, without all work
having been completed, the security shall be forfeited and the Borough may use the security
to have the necessary remedial work completed.
§ 298-15. Borough lien letters.
[Amended 5-17-2004 by Ord. No. 824]
A request for a Borough lien letter or property tax certification letter must be accompanied by a
valid evidence of compliance certificate and a lien letter fee as set forth in the Borough's Fees
Resolution, all of which shall be delivered to the Borough at least seven days prior to the day said
letters are to be provided.
When requested by a property owner or his agent, and subject to time availability as determined
solely by the Borough Secretary, the Borough may issue an expedited Borough lien letter on two
days' notice upon the payment of an expedition fee as set forth in the Borough's Fees Resolution
in addition to the fee set forth above.
§ 298-16. Rules and regulations.
The Borough shall promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as approved by Borough
Council for the operation and enforcement of this article which shall include, but not be limited to:
Establishing acceptable forms of security or guaranty;
Establishing the form of applications, purchaser acknowledgments, and plumber certifications;
Limiting the times of year in which temporary evidence of compliance is available for reasons
of weather.
Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this section shall be in writing and distributed as
necessary to insure compliance with this article.

The fees set forth in this article may be changed from time to time by resolution of Council.[1]
Editor's Note: The Borough's Fees Resolution, as amended, is on file and available for inspection
during regular office hours in the office of the Borough Secretary.
§ 298-18. No conflict with general police powers.
Nothing in this article shall limit in any fashion whatsoever the Borough's right to enforce its ordinances
or the laws of the commonwealth. Nothing in this article shall be a defense to any citation issued by
any municipal corporation or the commonwealth pursuant to any law or ordinance.

The owner shall be assessed $6.67 per month per individual apartment or dwelling unit; plus
In addition to the monthly assessment, the owner shall be assessed the charge of $0.70 per

§ 298-27. Irrigation systems.
[Amended 5-18-2009 by Ord. No. 902[1]]

responsibility to contact the water company to complete arrangements for the installation of a separate
meter and pay all fees/charges related to same. The water company shall establish the costs of the
separate meter and the Borough shall not incur any cost associated with the installation of a separate
meter. The cost of the separate meter shall be determined solely by the water company and may be
substantial. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to contact the water company and to
decide if the owner wishes to pursue the option of having a separate meter installed. This option is
provided to residents on the basis that the Borough recognizes that water from irrigation systems will
not enter the sanitary sewage system. Nothing contained in this provision shall relieve the owner from
incurring the charges for water use described above. The quantity of water so measured by the meter
installed for irrigation systems measured by the second meter shall thereafter be excluded in

computing the sewage services charges to be paid by the resident. The charge, if any, for reading both
meters shall be added to the quarterly sewer rate.
Editor's Note: Section 2 of this ordinance provided as follows: "It shall be the responsibility of the person
wishing a separate meter for an irrigation system to contact the Pennsylvania American Water
Company prior to having a separate water line and meter installed. Such arrangements shall be at the
property owners' cost, and the owner shall be responsible to contact the water company for reading of
the meter and the billing procedures. A permit from the Borough of Pleasant Hills is not required for an
irrigation water line or meter nor is the Borough responsible for the installation or maintenance of such
meters."

1007; 12-17-2018 by Ord. No. 1018; 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 1026]
Any sewage bills shall be sent to and shall be payable by the party to whom the water bills are
addressed. Notification that sewage bills have become delinquent shall be sent to and shall be
payable by the record owner of the property. Regardless of the name on the bill, or if there is an
absence of the record owner's address on file, the sewage fees and charges are owed, jointly and
severally, by the occupant(s) of the premises and by the record owner(s) of the real property.
It shall be the duty of the record owner of all real property to make provisions to ensure that any
occupant of the real property pays the sewage fees, charges and/or assessments when due. All
unpaid sewage fees, charges and/or assessments, together with penalty and interest, and cost
shall become a lien on the real property.
As a condition precedent for the Pleasant Hills Authority to provide sewer usage services to a
residential dwelling or units, if either the water bills or the sanitary usage fee bills are addressed to
one who is not the owner of the real property, then the record owner of said real property must
notify the designated collector of sewage usage bills for the Authority of the following information:
Notice of addresses for real property where the occupants who are not the owner of the real
property are receiving water and/or sanitary sewage bills in their name;
The identity of the owner of the real property and the address where notice of delinquent bills
should be sent to the owner.
The record owner of residential real property shall provide updated information, as appropriate,
and keep the above information current. Thereafter, the collector of the sewage usage fees, by
first class mail, will notify the tenant and the owner within 30 days after the tenant's bill becomes
delinquent at the address provided by the owner to the collector for the sewage bills. The failure of
the owner of residential real property to register and provide the requisite information or to keep
the requisite information current will act as an absolute waiver of the defense that the owner did
not receive the notice that the tenant owed a bill within 30 days from the date the bill became
delinquent.

ATTACHMENTS
Attachment 1 - Appendix A, Operation and Maintenance (O and M) Agreement
§ 312-1. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Pleasant Hills MS4 Prohibited
Discharge Ordinance."
§ 312-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities
to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases pollution of water resources.
Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a permit for stormwater
discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s).

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)
Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote groundwater
recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this article. Stormwater BMPs are commonly
grouped into one of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this
article, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural
BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is installed to
capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide
variety of practices and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact
design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested
buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater
BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.

obstruction. Portable devices, such as basketball hoops or any other obstruction which block the
path of vehicles, including tree branches which block the roadway, must be relocated or trimmed

The Borough shall provide notice to the property owner of the need to remove the obstruction. In
the case of tree branches, the Borough shall provide a period of five days to remove the branches
unless the Borough determines the branches pose an imminent danger to people or property. If
the branches are not removed within the time established by the Borough, the Borough shall have

the homeowner and due within 30 days. The failure to satisfy these charges within 30 days shall
result in the charges being a lien on the property.

by the permittee according to municipal specifications. Unless permittee has been granted
permission to restore the street surface as provided in Subsection B(4), permittee also shall
place a temporary surface on the pavement cut, opening or excavation in accordance with
municipal specification. If the permittee has been granted permission to restore the street
surface but weather conditions are such as to prevent the completion of permanent
restoration of the street surface at the time backfilling is completed, permittee shall install a
temporary surface in accordance with municipal specifications until such time as weather
conditions will permit permanent restoration of the street surface.
The Borough Engineer shall be notified by the permittee during the forty-eight-hour periods
preceding the beginnings of backfilling and restoration and the approximate time each will be
begun.
[Amended 2-16-2009 by Ord. No. 901]

performed by the permittee according to Borough specifications and shall be subject to
Borough approval and the inspection of the Borough Engineer.
[Amended 2-16-2009 by Ord. No. 901]
If the Borough Engineer finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street openings may be
damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a number of cross
trenches are laid in proximity to one another, or where the equipment used may cause such
damage, he may require negotiated contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in
place of patching of such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged
area exceeds 25% of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete
gutter edges. Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to
issuance of a permit.

After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the same shall be
prosecuted with due diligence. Unless the provisions of Subsection B(1) of this section apply,
the permittee is required to complete permanent restoration of the street surface in
accordance with municipal specifications within seven days after repairs and/or installation
are completed. Furthermore, the permittee shall be required to install and maintain a
temporary surface in accordance with municipal specifications during:
The period between the completion of repairs and/or installation and the commencement
of final restoration; and
The periods during the actual work when workers do not require access to the
excavation.
Inspections of all work authorized by a permit shall be made by the Borough Engineer at such
times and in such manner as required to assure compliance with provisions of this article. If
the nature of the work to be performed under any permit is such as to require the services of
a full-time inspector, the Borough Engineer shall provide for services of such an inspector.
[Amended 2-16-2009 by Ord. No. 901]

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Pleasant Hills Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 323-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public
health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies
and supports the base flow of streams.
The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development (LID) are intended to address
the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic
natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and recharge; 2) evapotranspire; and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program.
§ 323-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the municipality and its
watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 323-2 of this chapter,
through provisions designed to:
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the
waters of this commonwealth.
Preserve natural drainage systems.
Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and mimic predevelopment
hydrology.
Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.

A.
Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best management practices (BMPs)
that are implemented within the municipality.
Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
§ 323-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the
Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,[1] as amended,
and/or the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1, et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 323-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff, including land development
and earth disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this chapter.
§ 323-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 323-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or provision of this chapter
invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 323-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility
to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance.
§ 323-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or erroneous information
provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work
undertaken or use established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action
may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality purporting to validate such a
violation.
§ 323-10. Waivers.
If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter cannot be achieved for a
particular regulated activity, the municipality may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve
measures other than those in this chapter, subject to § 323-10B. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification or waiver shall originate
with the landowner, shall be in writing, and shall accompany the stormwater management site plan

submitted to the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the request is based,
the provisions of the chapter involved, and the proposed modification. The designated plan
reviewer shall review the request to determine if it meets the requirements of the chapter,
including Subsection B below. If acceptable to the municipality, the municipality may grant the
waiver or modification.
Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be approved by the municipality
if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions
peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or detrimental
to the public interest and will achieve the intended outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter is
preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and not to
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Stormwater Management
Ordinance. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater management site plan
submission, as directed in § 323-10A above.
No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity involving earth disturbance greater
than or equal to one acre may be granted by the municipality.
§ 323-11. Version of regulations and standards.
Any reference to a statute, regulation or standard, shall be interpreted to refer to the latest or most
current version of that document.

AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY
Activities associated with agriculture such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and
animal heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including tillage, land clearing,
plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and raising of livestock and
installation of conservation measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious area is not
considered an agricultural activity.
APPLICANT
A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an application to the municipality for
approval to engage in any regulated activity at a project site in the municipality.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)
Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote groundwater recharge,
and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into
one of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter,
nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices that
attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is installed to capture and
treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low-impact design, bioretention,
wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention
basins, and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to
the project site.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT
A conservation district, as defined in Section 3(c) of the Conservation District Law [3 P.S. § 851(c)]
that has the authority under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to administer and enforce
all or a portion or the regulations promulgated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
DEP
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM
The magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from a storm event measured in
probability of occurrence (e.g., a five-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design
and evaluation of stormwater management systems. Also see "return period."
DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER
A qualified professional as defined herein, or organization such as the Allegheny County
Conservation District, that has been designated by the municipality to be the reviewer of SWM site
plans for the municipality, and shall be understood to be the reviewer where indicated as the
municipality within this chapter.
DETENTION BASIN

and releasing it at a predetermined rate. Detention basins are designed to drain completely in a
designed period after a rainfall event, and to become dry until the next rainfall event.
DETENTION VOLUME
The volume of runoff that is captured and released into the waters of the commonwealth at a
controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)
See "project site."
DISTURBED AREA

action.
EXISTING CONDITION
The dominant land cover during the five-year period immediately preceding a proposed regulated
activity.
FEMA
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FLOODPLAIN
Any land area susceptible to inundation by water from any natural source or delineated by
applicable FEMA maps and studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that
comprise Group 13 soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for
Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODWAY
The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably
required to carry and discharge the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of
the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area
where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet
from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS
Planning and activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include conducting a
timber inventory, preparation of forest management plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets,
logging road design and construction, timber harvesting, site preparation, and reforestation.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
Systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse
stormwater on the site where it is generated.
GROUNDWATER
Water beneath the earth's surface that supplies wells and springs and is within the saturated zone
of soil and rock.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
The replenishment of existing natural underground water supplies from precipitation or overland
flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)
Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four
groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group classification.
The soils in the area of the development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can
be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious as
the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS[1]).

Code.[2]
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)
Site design approaches and small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that
infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly largescale
conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small,
cost-effective landscape features located on site.

Impervious areas.
The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the impervious areas in the total
proposed development even if development is to take place in stages.
For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan must be used in
determining conformance with this chapter.
For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total impervious area on the parcel is
subject to the requirements of this chapter; except that the volume controls in § 323-16 and
the peak rate controls of § 323-17 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas
that are not being altered by the proposed regulated activity.
Stormwater flows onto adjacent or downstream property shall not be created, increased,
decreased, relocated, impeded, or otherwise altered without written notification of the affected
property owner(s). Notification shall include a description of the proposed development and the
stormwater flows that are being created, increased, decreased, relocated, impeded, or otherwise
altered. Adjacent property shall at a minimum include any property having a shared boundary with
the subject property of the SWM site plan, however, if in the judgment of the designated plan
reviewer additional properties are being affected, additional notifications may be required. Proof of
notification (signed postal receipt for example) shall be included as part of the SWM plan
submission to the municipality. Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
Protect health, safety, and property.
Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing measures to:
Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas.

facilities must be shown.
Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation requirements of this chapter
provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this chapter provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
Roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects, which do not increase impervious area, and
underground infrastructure projects are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, provided the
activities meet the requirements of all other municipal, state and federal requirements.
Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the applicant from the
requirements in § 323-14D through J.
The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this section at any time for any
project that the municipality believes may pose a threat to public health and safety or the
environment.
Voluntary green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) retrofit projects that are solely intended to better
manage runoff from existing development and are not part of new development or redevelopment
are exempt from the stormwater management provisions of this chapter. This does not exempt
such projects from any other municipal, state, or federal regulation.
§ 323-16. Volume controls.
The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual[1] shall be
utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented
using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the
Simplified Method in Subsection B below, or alternative design criteria as allowed by Pa. Code Title 25,
Chapter 102.
The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual[2]) is applicable as a method to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions. The following
shall be incorporated into the CG-1 Method:
Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than
the two-year twenty-four-hour duration precipitation.
At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a facility
designed for a twenty-four-to-seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated
stormwater system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a
facility designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a combined
sewer system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
For modeling purposes:
Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be considered meadow in
good condition.

Editor's Note: See § 323-39C.
The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual[3]) provided below is independent of site
conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of runoff from the net increase
in impervious surfaces.
At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a facility
designed for a twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated stormwater
system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility
designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a combined sewer
system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the
entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
This method is exempt from the requirements of § 323-17, Rate controls.
Editor's Note: See § 323-39C.
Editor's Note: See § 323-39C.
§ 323-17. Rate controls.
For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 stormwater management
plan: Postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for
the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events. This is
the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to those rates shown in the maps
contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release Rate Management Districts).[1] This
predevelopment-to-postdevelopment control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the
"Conditional Direct Discharge" areas on the release rate maps. If it is shown that the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-,
and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of
discharge requirement. Peak flows should be computed using the methods included in the chapter
titled "Stormwater Calculations and Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP
Manual.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 stormwater management
plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm
events, the postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release Rate Management
Districts)[2] of this model ordinance. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the

Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 323-18. Riparian buffers.
In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer easement shall be created and
recorded as part of any subdivision or land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The
intent of this chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve stream water quality.
The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland flow to the stream through the presence of native
grasses, trees and shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition of
sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer rather than in the stream; and
reducing erosion by providing stream bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams;
keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation.
Except as required by Pa. Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer easement shall be
required for all streams (as defined in Article II) with a contributing watershed area of greater than
10 acres. The riparian buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the top
of the stream bank (on each side).
Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted that is inconsistent with the
intent of the riparian buffer as described in § 323-18A.
Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within the riparian buffer
easement.
Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively removed and the riparian buffer
easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse

§ 356-18.1. Establishment of weight limits on certain Borough
roads.
[Added 5-20-2013 by Ord. No. 958]
Weight limits.
The existing Code of the Borough of Pleasant Hills, at Chapter 356, Article III, shall be
amended, in limited part, to recognize the following weight limits:
Road
Area of Vehicle Weight
Restriction Maximum Vehicle Weight
Arbor Lane Entire length of roadway 5 tons (10,000 pounds)
East Bruceton Road Entire length of roadway 5 tons (10,000 pounds)
Dutch Lane Entire length of roadway 5 tons (10,000 pounds)
Mowry Drive Entire length of roadway 5 tons (10,000 pounds)
West Bruceton Road Entire length of roadway 10 tons (20,000 pounds)
The weight limit study completed by the Borough Engineer referred to a single-axle weight
limit. For purposes of this section, the term "single axle" is used as that term is defined in the
Pennsylvania Code as may be amended. The Pennsylvania Code currently defines the term
"single axle" as an axle located over eight feet from another axle. The weight limits described
herein shall apply to all vehicles regardless of the number of axles.
Violations of section. A violation of this section may be established by either the gross vehicle
weight as defined by the registration of the vehicle or the actual vehicle weight. The actual vehicle
weight may be determined by weighing the vehicle at an established weigh station or certified
scale, and the vehicle weight shall include the amount of any load carried by said vehicle.
However, it shall not be necessary to establish a violation of this section by actually weighing the
vehicle if the vehicle registration establishes a gross vehicle weight in excess of the weight limits
described herein. Violations may also be established subject to the provisions of 75 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 4902(a) and (b) as may be amended.
Enforcement of section. The Borough of Pleasant Hills, by and through the Police Department, an
agent or authorized contractor is hereby authorized to use all weight measurement devices
approved by any agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine the weight of the
vehicles and/or to rely upon the weight of the vehicle as established by the vehicle registration.
For purposes of weighing vehicles, the Borough may utilize any of the methods and procedures
recognized in the Pennsylvania Code and/or the Motor Vehicle Code. Such authority shall be
consistent with the procedures described in 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 4979.3 as may be amended, and the
actual weighing of the vehicles may be performed by a person authorized to weigh such vehicles
and not necessarily a Borough Police Officer.

Notice of weight limits by appropriate sign. Signs publishing the vehicle weight limitations
described herein shall be erected and maintained within 25 feet of each end of the portion of the
roadway so restricted contingent upon sufficient space being available for the placement of the
sign. If circumstances prohibit the sign from being placed within 25 feet of the restricted area, the
sign shall be placed as near as possible to this location. In the case of any restriction which does
not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted road, an advance informational sign shall
be placed at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted portion of said road.
Exemptions.
School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local pickups and deliveries shall be
exempt from the maximum weight limits imposed herein; provided, however, that in the case
of overweight vehicles making local pickups and deliveries, such vehicles shall be exempt
only when utilizing a course of travel which results in the shortest available route upon roads
restricted by the maximum weight limit imposed herein. Those vehicles making local pickups
and deliveries shall only be exempt if the property they are traveling to or from is within the
Borough of Pleasant Hills.
Permits for overweight vehicles for construction projects within the Borough of Pleasant Hills
may be obtained subject to the procedure administered by the Zoning Officer. These permits

amended. Permits may also be issued pursuant to the provisions of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 4902(c)
as may be amended and subject to the posting of security as described therein. The owners
of vehicles which travel the roads which are the subject of the weight limits described herein
who do not have a valid permit are in violation of this section and subject to the penalties
described herein.
Permits for nonexempt vehicles shall be issued by the Zoning Officer following the completion
of an approved permit application and the payment of a permit fee of $250. The amount of
this fee shall be set and/or amended by the Fee Resolution of the Borough as may be
amended. The application shall be completed by the owner or authorized agent of the vehicle
which will be the subject of the permit. The permit application shall be accompanied by a
bond issued pursuant to PennDOT regulations to recover the cost of damage to the roadway.
In the event the actual damage caused by an overweight vehicle exceeds the amount of the
bond, the owner of the vehicle shall be responsible for the actual damages to the road which
exceeds the amount of the bond.
Penalty for exceeding maximum weight. Any person or entity found in violation of this section shall
be subject to the provisions of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 4945 as may be amended. As of the date of the
enactment of this section, these provisions include the following:

readjusting loads of vehicles), any person operating a vehicle or combination with a weight on
an axle or group of consecutive axles exceeding the maximum axle weights allowed by
§ 4943 (relating to maximum axle weight of vehicles) is guilty of a summary offense and shall,

Article I. Introduction
§ 374-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Zoning Ordinance of the Borough of Pleasant
Hills.
§ 374-2. Zoning Map.
The map herein referred to which is identified by the title Pleasant Hills Borough Zoning Map and by
the signatures of the duly authorized officers of the Borough affixed thereto shall be known as the
Zoning Map and such map, together with all notations, references and other data shown thereon is
hereby incorporated by reference to this chapter as is more fully described herein. Said Zoning Map
shall be kept up to date regarding additions, planned development and street extension. It shall be on
file and available for examination by persons interested therein at the offices of the Borough of
Pleasant Hills.
§ 374-3. Incorporation of county airport zoning.
The Allegheny County Airport Zoning Regulations are incorporated herein by reference for the airport
hazard area within the territorial limits of the Borough of Pleasant Hills as identified in the County of
Allegheny Airport Zoning Regulations for Allegheny County Airport. These regulations are adopted in
compliance with the requirements of the Airport Zoning Act, 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5911 et seq.
§ 374-4. Interpretation; purpose.
In interpreting and applying this chapter, the provisions shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare and shall
not prohibit the adoption of more restrictive requirements of this nature.
Effect on lots and boundary lines.
It is fundamental to the purpose of this chapter to recognize that many existing lots throughout
the Borough are less adequate than others because of their location or size or odd shape or
difficult topography, or any combination of these limitations. A claim of hardship under this
chapter, therefore, shall not be allowable on behalf of any lot because the physical
characteristics of the lot prevent it from being built upon exactly as in another lot abutting or

close to it or in the same zoning district. The regulations herein permit most such lots to be
satisfactorily built upon. There can be some alleviation for other lots through variances (minor
concessions) granted by the Zoning Hearing Board when special physical conditions make
literal enforcement of the regulations either unsatisfactory in the interest of the people at large
or actually impossible.
While this chapter applies only to property within the Borough, in the protection of the health
and safety and welfare of the people at large, and in the encouragement of the establishment
and maintenance of reasonable community standards of physical environment, the effect of
such application on adjacent properties and neighborhoods without regard to municipal
boundary lines should be considered. It is the intention that the administration of this chapter,
where it affects properties adjacent to the Borough boundary line, will be such as to promote
cooperation with other political subdivisions involved, for the uniform benefit and protection of
all affected properties.
This section shall be considered, together with all the provisions of this chapter, when
appraising the spirit of the ordinance as a guide to its interpretation.
All buildings for which permits have been obtained and the construction of which or a portion of
which has been begun, or for which a contract or contracts have been let pursuant to a permit
issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, may be completed and used in accordance with
the plans on which said permit was granted.
All permits for buildings which were issued prior to the adoption of this chapter are declared void if
at the time of the effective date of this chapter:
No construction of such building shall have been made; and
No contract or contracts have been let pursuant to said permit, provided in either case such
building or its use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter.
§ 374-5. Community development objectives.
These regulations are made in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan for the Borough of
Pleasant Hills and the goals and objectives stated therein.
In addition, these regulations are designed to:
Lessen congestion in the streets;
Secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;
Promote health and general welfare;
Provide adequate light and air;
Prevent the overcrowding of land;
Avoid undue concentration of population; and
Facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other
public requirements.
Reasonable consideration has been given, among other things, to the character of the district and
its particular suitability for particular uses and to conserving the value of buildings and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the Borough.

Article XIVA. Airport District Overlay
[Added 11-19-2012 by Ord. No. 953]
§ 374-55.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to create an airport district overlay that considers safety issues around the
Allegheny County Airport, regulates and restricts the heights of constructed structures and objects of
natural growth, creates appropriate zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing for
changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones, creates the permitting process for use within
said zones and provides for enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and
judicial review.
§ 374-55.2. Relation to other zoning districts.
The Airport District Overlay shall not modify the boundaries of any underlying zoning district. Where
identified, the Airport District Overlay shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction
in addition to those contained in the underlying zoning district.
§ 374-55.3. Definitions.
The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings given to them in
this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
AIRPORT ELEVATION
The highest point of an airport's usable landing area measured in feet above sea level. The airport
elevation of the Allegheny County Airport is 1,250 feet above mean sea level.
AIRPORT HAZARD
Any structure or object, natural or manmade, or use of land which obstructs the airspace required
for flight or aircraft in landing or taking off at an airport or is otherwise hazardous as defined in 14
CFR Part 77 and 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5102.
AIRPORT HAZARD AREA
Any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard might be established if not prevented as
provided for in this article and Act 164 of 1984 (Pennsylvania laws relating to aviation).[1]
APPROACH SURFACE (ZONE)
An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway center line and extending
outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each
end of the runway based on the planned approach. The inner edge of the approach surface is the
same width as the primary surface and expands uniformly depending on the planned approach.
The approach surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,[2] is derived from the approach surface.
CONICAL SURFACE (ZONE)
An imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface
at a slope of 20 feet horizontally to one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The
conical surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,[3] is based on the conical surface.

DEPARTMENT
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
FAA
The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.
HEIGHT
For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this article and shown on
the Zoning Map,[4] the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
HORIZONTAL SURFACE (ZONE)
An imaginary plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation that is constructed by
swinging arcs of various radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then
connecting the adjacent arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is based on the planned
approach. The horizontal surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,[5] is derived from the horizontal
surface.
LARGER THAN UTILITY RUNWAY
A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller-driven aircraft of greater
than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and jet-powered aircraft.
NONCONFORMING USE
Any preexisting structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the
provisions of this article or an amendment thereto.

only horizontal guidance, or area-type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in nonprecision
instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.
OBSTRUCTION
Any structure, growth, or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height
set forth by this article.
PRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY
A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system
(ILS) or a precisions approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision
approach system is planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other
planning document.
PRIMARY SURFACE (ZONE)
An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the runway, extending 200 feet beyond the end of
paved runways or ending at each end of turf runways. The elevation of any point on the primary
surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway center line. The primary
surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,[6] is derived from the primary surface.
RUNWAY
A defined area of an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length.
STRUCTURE
An object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including, but without
limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formation and overhead transmission
lines.

who plans to erect a new structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect and maintain any
object (natural or manmade) in the vicinity of the airport shall first notify the Department's Bureau
of Aviation (BOA) by submitting PENNDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of the
proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The Department's BOA response must
be included with this permit application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's BOA
returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit request should be considered in
compliance with the intent of this Overlay article. If the Department's BOA returns a determination
of a penetration of airspace, the permit shall be denied, and the project sponsor may seek a
variance from such regulations as outlined in § 374-55.6.
Editor's Note: See 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.

No notice or review under this section is required for any of the following construction or
alterations:
Any object that would be shielded by existing structures of a permanent and substantial
character or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater height and would be
located in the congested area of a city, town, or settlement where it is evident beyond all
reasonable doubt that the structure so shielded will not adversely affect safety in air
navigation.
Any antenna structure of 20 feet or less in height except one that would increase the height of
another antenna structure.
Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing aid, aircraft-arresting device, or
meteorological device, of a type approved by the Administrator, or an appropriate military
service on military airports, the location and height of which is fixed by functional purpose.
Any construction or alteration for which notice is required by any other FAA regulation.
§ 374-55.6. Variances.
Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance with 14 CFR 77, Subpart B
(FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will
depend on the determinations made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider in which of the following categories
the FAA has placed the proposed construction:
No objection. The subject construction is determined to not exceed obstruction standards,
and marking/lighting is not required to mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination, a
variance shall be granted.
Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to create some
level of encroachment into an airport hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under
this determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating
measures as described in § 374-55.9, Obstruction marking and lighting.
Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to be a hazard and is thus
objectionable. A variance shall be denied, and the reasons for this determination shall be
outlined to the applicant.
Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not
be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this article.
§ 374-55.7. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use shall be made of land or water within the
Airport District Overlay in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
Allegheny County Airport.

nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher, so as to increase the
nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once substantially abated (subject to the underlying Zoning
Ordinance), may only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
§ 374-55.9. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this article may be conditioned according

in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting the permit
or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure
both ground and air safety.

§ 374-90. Continuation of facilities.
Whenever an occupancy permit has been issued and the plans so approved contain automobile
parking and loading space provisions, the subsequent use of such property shall be conditional upon
the continuance and availability of the parking and loading space provisions contained in such plans.
Any other use of such property shall be a violation of this article. Should the owner or occupant of any
structure, as to which an occupancy permit has been issued containing automobile parking or loading
space requirements, so change the use to which such structure is put as to increase automobile
parking or loading space requirements under this article, it shall be unlawful and a violation of this
chapter to begin or maintain such altered use until such time as the increased automobile parking or
loading provisions of this article are complied with and an amended certificate of occupancy obtained
from the Zoning Officer. Existing off-street parking and loading facilities provided at the effective date of
this chapter, and actually being used at that date for the parking of automobiles, or as loading space in
connection with the operation of an existing structure or use of off-street parking and loading facilities
provided after the effective date of this chapter for the parking of automobiles or as loading space in

Parking pads perpendicular to the street, adjacent to driveways and/or walkways shall
not have a combined width greater than 20 feet.

impervious surface is one which includes a porous surface. This includes material known
as porous pavement which consists of concrete block or brick pavers that have built-in
gaps or openings to allow rainwater to infiltrate. The purpose of porous pavement is to
provide stormwater retention and to assist with the natural water cycle. The impervious
surface may also be constructed of a surface known as "gravel grass." The surface of
gravel grass shall be porous and include a grass cover which permits water retention.
This surface shall consist of a gravel parking space which is then covered with topsoil
and seeded with a grass cover. The specific method that is used is subject to the
approval of the Zoning Officer.

the property line shall be planted and maintained in grass or ground cover or in landscaping
materials which may be proposed as part of a buffer area required by this chapter.
§ 374-92. Parking and storage of unlicensed or uninspected
vehicles.
Automotive vehicles of any kind without both a current license plate and a current state inspection
sticker shall not be parked or stored on any residentially zoned property for a period of time to exceed
90 days, other than in a completely closed building.[1]

§ 374-93. Applicability.
The provisions of this article affecting the nonconforming uses of land and buildings and
nonconforming structures cited herein shall apply under the provisions of this chapter as enacted
initially, to amendments to this chapter and to zoning or rezoning of areas annexed to the Borough.
§ 374-94. Nonconforming structures.
The following regulations shall apply to nonconforming structures in any zoning district:
Structural alteration. No such structure may be enlarged or structurally altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, except when the Zoning Hearing Board may determine undue
hardship and may authorize a reasonable modification of such structure.
Damage or destruction. Should any such structure, other than a sign, be destroyed by any means
to an extent of more than 75% of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. In the event that such
damage or destruction is 75% or less than the replacement cost of the structure, repairs or
reconstruction may be undertaken, provided that such restoration is started within 12 months of
the date of destruction.

Moving. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall
thereafter conform to the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
Signs. Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, subject to the following regulations
and provided that no structural alterations are made which increase the gross surface area of the
sign.
Nonconforming signs may not be enlarged, added to or replaced by another nonconforming
sign, use or structure, except that the interchange of the panels which display the advertising
shall be permitted.
A nonconforming sign which is damaged to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement
value shall not be repaired, reconstructed or moved unless it complies with all applicable
provisions of this chapter for signs.
No new conforming business identification sign shall be permitted on any property unless
every sign on the property is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter; provided,
however, that on lots containing several tenants, a nonconforming sign of one tenant shall not
preclude another tenant from erecting a conforming sign.
Repair or maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the safety of the public.
§ 374-95. Nonconforming lots and/or structures.
The following regulations shall apply to nonconforming uses of structures or lots or structures and lots
in combination in any zoning district.
Continuation. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful use
of a lot or structure exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as
enacted or amended, such use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful.
Enlargement or expansion.
No nonconforming use of a lot or structure shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter, unless the Zoning Hearing Board shall interpret that the enlargement or
extension is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth of trade of the nonconforming
use.
No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot
occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a structure which was
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time that the use became nonconforming,
provided that the structure is located on a lot or portion of a lot owned at the time the use
became nonconforming.
Change of use. Any change in the use of a nonconforming use of a lot or structure shall be only to
a use permitted within the district in which the lot or structure is located, unless the Zoning Hearing
Board determines that a change to another nonconforming use is equally appropriate to the district
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. Once changed to a
conforming use, however, no structure or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot is discontinued or abandoned
for six consecutive months or for 12 months during any two-year period, the structure and/or lot
8/17/2020 Borough of Pleasant Hills, PA Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/PL1849?guid=PL1849&children=true 319/339

adjust the strict application of the requirements of this chapter in the case of an exceptionally

of this chapter in such cases as are herein expressly provided for in other sections of this chapter in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter, with the power to impose appropriate
conditions and safeguards as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties
and the public interest. In considering such applications, the Board shall give due regard to the nature
and condition of all adjacent uses and structures and in interpreting and applying the provisions of this
chapter they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the Borough. In addition, the Board shall consider whether said
exception shall result in an unreasonable density of population in relation to municipal water and
sewers available, whether the existing highways are adequate to serve such exception without causing
traffic congestion or unusual noise or any noise which shall annoy, disturb, injure or endanger the
comfort, health, peace or safety of others in the operation of such activity.
§ 374-106. Action on appealed issues.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, such Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this
article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or

Borough affected by any decision of the Zoning Officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable
time as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the Zoning Officer and with the Zoning Hearing
Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Officer shall forthwith transmit to
the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The
Board shall refuse to entertain any zoning appeal hereunder unless the applicants notice of appeal
indicates that all other Borough requirements for a building permit have been complied with. In lieu of
meeting all such Borough requirements for a building permit before seeking a zoning permit from the
Zoning Hearing Board, the applicant will comply with all other requirements of the Borough.
§ 374-108. Time limitations.
No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board later than 30 days after a
preliminary or final application for development has been approved by an appropriate Borough
officer, agency or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in
any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after
such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an adverse decision by the Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map filed pursuant to Section 916.2 of the

final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval.

§ 374-110. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or
body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board
by persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings
before the Board. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of
the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court.

of receipt of the application, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within 45 days after the hearing or if said hearing is continued,
within 45 days after said continued hearing.
Where the Board fails to render the decision within the required 45 days or fails to hold the public
hearing within 60 days of the date of the applicants request for a hearing, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed, in
writing or on the record, to an extension of time.
When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to
meet or render a decision within the time required, the Board shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days of the last day it could have met to render a decision. If the Board shall fail
to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right
of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 374-112. Filing of decision.
The Zoning Hearing Board, upon reaching any decision on any appeal filed to it, shall forward a copy
of such decision to the Borough Secretary of the Borough of Pleasant Hills.
§ 374-113. Mediation option.
Parties to proceedings authorized in this article within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Hearing Board may

Any landowner who wishes to challenge the validity, on substantive grounds, of this chapter or the

which he has an interest may file a curative amendment together with a written request that the
challenge and the proposed amendment be heard and decided by Borough Council in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 609.2, 53 P.S. § 10609.2, and 1004 (see now 53 P.S. § 10916.1) of the

revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects. Borough
Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies, schools and other
public service facilities;

provisions of this chapter or map;
The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the sites soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;
The impact of the proposed use on the sites soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
natural resources and natural features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed,
the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and
The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other land uses which are
essential to public health and welfare.
Declaration of invalidity by the court. If the Borough does not accept a landowners curative
amendment brought in accordance with this section and a court subsequently rules that the
challenge has merit, the courts decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this entire
chapter, but only for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowners curative

commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the determination of a violation by
the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice, determining
that there has been a violation, further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation,
in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice and thereafter each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the Borough.
The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling
the per diem fine pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant to any person or entity
other than the Borough the right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
§ 374-130. Causes of action.
In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, converted maintained or used in violation of this chapter, Borough Council, or
with the approval of Borough Council, any officer of the Borough, in addition to other remedies, may
institute any appropriate action or proceeding to correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping
or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a
violation.

That space on the poles erected or in any conduits constructed under the provisions of this
ordinance may be used, free of charge, for the purpose of carrying wires of any fire alarm or police
telegraph system owned and maintained by the said Borough, provided that the said wires are
placed and maintained in such a manner as may be prescribed by the said company, and that no
use shall be made of such space by the said Borough which will result in interfering with or
impairing the operation or use of the said company's property or service or will endanger its
property or employees.
That the said company shall maintain all posts, poles, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, mains, pipes,
manholes, and all other apparatus erected or constructed under the provisions of this chapter in
good and safe order and condition, and shall at all times fully indemnify, protect and save
harmless the said Borough from and against all actions, claims, suits, damages and charges, and
against all loss, and necessary expenditures arising from the erection, construction and
maintenance of its system, or from its neglect or failure to maintain the said apparatus in good and
safe order and condition.
That nothing in this ordinance contained shall be construed to grant unto the said company any
exclusive right, or to prevent a grant of similar privileges to other companies.
This ordinance shall take effect at the expiration of 30 days from the date when a copy thereof
shall have been filed in the office of the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,
provided that if the Commission shall, prior to the expiration of such period, institute a proceeding
under the provision of Section 911 of the Public Utility Law affecting its validity, this ordinance shall
become effective only upon approval by the said Commission.
That the said company shall, under its seal and by its proper officers within 60 days from the date
of the final enactment of this ordinance, signify in writing its acceptance of all the terms,
conditions, regulations and restrictions herein contained, in default of which this ordinance shall
become null and void and of no effect.
