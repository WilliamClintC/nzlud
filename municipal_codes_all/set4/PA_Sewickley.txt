§ 16-1 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-2
1:22
(1) Rule 14. Council members shall occupy the respective seats in the
Council Chamber assigned to them by the presiding officer.
C. Appearance of fairness doctrine.
(1) Rule 15. Appearance of fairness doctrine and its application.
(a) Appearance of fairness doctrine defined. When public hearing
gives the public not only the right to attend but the right to be
heard as well, the hearing must not only be fair but must
appear to be so. It is a situation where appearances are quite
as important as substance. The test of whether the appearance
of fairness doctrine has been violated is as follows: Would a
disinterested person, having been apprised of the totality of a
board member's personal interest in a matter being acted
upon, be reasonably justified in thinking that partiality may
exist? If answered in the affirmative, such deliberations and
any course of conduct reached thereon should be voided.
(b) Types of hearings to which doctrine applies. The appearance of
fairness doctrine shall apply only to those actions of the
Council which are quasi-judicial in nature. Quasi-judicial
actions are defined as actions of the Borough Council which
determine the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific
parties in a hearing or other contested proceeding. Quasijudicial
actions do not include the legislative actions adopting,
amending or revising comprehensive, community or
neighborhood plans or other land use planning documents or
the adoption of area-wide zoning ordinances or the adoption of
a zoning amendment that is of area-wide significance. Some
examples of quasi-judicial actions which may come before the
Council are: rezones or reclassifications of specific parcels of
property, appeals from decisions of the Planning Commission,
substantive appeals of threshold decisions under the state
environmental protection laws, subdivisions, street vacations
and special land use permits.
(c) Obligations of Council members; procedure.
[1] Council members should recognize that the appearance of
fairness doctrine does not require establishment of a
conflict of interest, but whether there is an appearance of
conflict of interest to the average person. This may involve
the Council member or a Council member's business
associate or a member of the Council member's immediate
family. It could involve ex parte communications,
ownership of property in the vicinity, business dealings
with the proponents or opponents before or after the
hearing, business dealings of the Council member's
employer with the proponents or opponents, announced
predisposition and the like. Prior to any quasi-judicial
§ 16-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-2
1:23
hearing, each Council member should give consideration
to whether a potential violation of the appearance of
fairness doctrine exists. If a potential violation exists, no
matter how remote, the Council member should disclose
such facts to the Borough Manager, who may seek the
opinion of the Borough Solicitor as to whether a potential
violation exists. The Borough Manager shall communicate
such opinion to the Council member and to the presiding
officer.
[2] Anyone seeking to disqualify a Council member from
participating in a decision on the basis of a violation of the
appearance of fairness doctrine must raise the challenge
as soon as the basis for disqualification is made known or
reasonably should have been made known prior to the
issuance of the decision; upon failure to do so, the doctrine
may not be relied upon to invalidate the decision. The
party seeking to disqualify the Council member shall state
with specificity the basis for disqualification; for example,
demonstrated bias or prejudice for or against a party to
the proceedings; a monetary interest in outcome of the
proceedings; prejudgment of the issue prior to hearing the
facts on the record; or ex parte contact. Should such
challenge be made prior to the hearing, the Borough
Manager shall direct the Borough Solicitor to interview
the Council member and render an opinion as to the
likelihood that an appearance of fairness violation would
be sustained in superior court. Should such challenge be
made in the course of a quasi-judicial hearing, the
presiding officer shall call a recess to permit the Borough
Solicitor to make such interview and render such opinion.
[3] The presiding officer shall have sole authority to request a
Council member to excuse himself/herself on the basis of
an appearance of fairness violation. Further, if two or more
Council members believe that an appearance of fairness
violation exists, such individuals may move to request a
Council member to excuse himself/herself on the basis of
an appearance of fairness violation. In arriving at this
decision, the presiding officer or other Council members
shall give due regard to the opinion of the Borough
Solicitor.
[4] Notwithstanding the request of the presiding officer or
other Council members, the Council member may
participate in any such proceeding.
(d) Specific statutory provisions.
§ 16-2 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-2
1:24
[1] Candidates for the Borough Council may express their
opinions about pending or proposed quasi-judicial actions
while campaigning.
[2] A candidate for the Borough Council who complies with all
provisions of applicable public disclosure and ethics laws
shall not be limited under the appearance of fairness
doctrine from accepting campaign contributions to finance
the campaign, including outstanding debts.
[3] During the pendency of any quasi-judicial proceeding, no
Council member may engage in ex parte (outside the
hearing) communications with proponents or opponents
about a proposal involved in the pending proceeding,
unless the Council member:
[a] Places on the record the substance of such oral or
written communications; and
[b] Provides that a public announcement of the content of
the communication and of the parties' right to rebut
the substance of the communication shall be made at
each hearing where action is taken or considered on
the subject. This does not prohibit correspondence
between a citizen and his/her elected official if the
correspondence is made a part of the record, when it
pertains to the subject matter of a quasi-judicial
proceeding.
(e) Public disclosure file. The Secretary shall maintain a public
disclosure file, which shall be available for inspection by the
public. As to members of the Planning Commission, the file
shall contain for each member a disclosure statement. The
Planning Commission disclosure statement shall list all real
property and all business interests located in the Borough of
Sewickley in which the member or the member's spouse,
dependent children or other dependent relative living with the
member have a financial interest.
(f) Procedure on application. Any person making application for
any action leading to a quasi-judicial hearing shall be provided
with a document containing the following information: 1) the
names and address of all members of the Borough Council, the
Planning Commission; 2) a statement that public disclosure
information is available for public inspection regarding all such
members; and 3) a statement that if the applicant intends to
raise an appearance of fairness issue, the applicant should do
so at least two weeks prior to any public hearing. The applicant
shall acknowledge receipt of such document.

B. Motions.

business that require Council approval prior to the expenditure of

has been made and seconded, each Council member shall be
permitted to speak for a maximum of five minutes with respect to
the motion. After every Council member who desires to speak
initially with respect to the motion has spoken, each Council
member shall be permitted to speak for an additional five minutes
in response to the comments of other Council members. In the
event a Council member wishes to extend debate, he/she may make
a motion to do so, and a majority of Council shall have the right to
vote to extend debate.
C. Order of business.
(1) Rule 19A.
(a) The business of all regular committee of the whole meetings of

presiding officer during the committee of the whole meeting,

D. Actions for a public hearing.
(1) Rule 20. The procedures for a public hearing are as follows:
(a) Prior to the start of the "comments from the public" portion of
the public hearing, the presiding officer may require that all
persons wishing to be heard shall sign in with the Secretary,
giving their names and addresses, the agenda item and
whether they wish to speak as proponent, opponent or
otherwise. Any person who fails to sign in shall not be
permitted to speak until all those who signed in have done so.
At any public hearing all persons who have signed in and wish
to be heard shall be heard. However, the presiding officer shall
be authorized to invoke Rule 33 and otherwise establish
speaker time limits and control presentations to avoid
§ 16-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-3
1:28
repetition. In public hearings that are not of a quasi-judicial
nature, the presiding officer, subject to concurrence of the
majority of the Council, may establish time limits and
otherwise control presentations. The presiding officer may
change the order of speakers so that testimony is heard in the
most logical groupings (i.e., proponents, opponents, adjacent
owners, vested interests, etc.).
(b) The presiding officer introduces the agenda item, opens the
public hearing and announces the following rules of order:
[1] "All comments by proponents, opponents or the public
shall be made from the speaker's rostrum and any
individual making comments shall first give his/her name
and address. This is required because an official record of
the public hearing is being made. If there is any appeal to
the State Court of Appeals, the court must make its
decision on the basis of what was said here."
[2] "It is not necessary to be a proponent or opponent in order
to speak. If you consider yourself neither a proponent nor
opponent, please speak during the proponent portion and
identify yourself as neither a proponent nor an opponent."
[3] "No comments shall be made from any other location and
anyone making 'out of order' comments may be subject to
removal from the meeting."
[4] "There will be no demonstrations during or at the
conclusion of anyone's presentation."
[5] "These rules are intended to promote an orderly system of
holding a public hearing, to give every person an
opportunity to be heard, and to ensure that no individual is
embarrassed by exercising his/her right of free speech."
(c) "At this time the opponents will have an opportunity to speak.
Should any opponent have questions to ask of the proponents,
ask the questions during your presentation. The proponents
shall note the question asked, and answer such questions when
the proponent speaks in rebuttal. The proponent shall be
required to answer any reasonable question, provided that the
presiding officer reserves the right to rule any question out of
order."
(d) Opponents speak.
(e) The presiding officer calls for additional opponents three
times.
(f) The presiding officer calls for proponents to speak in rebuttal.
A proponent speaking in rebuttal shall not introduce new
§ 16-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-3
1:29
material. If the proponent does, or is allowed to do so, the
opponents shall also be allowed to rebut the new elements.
(g) The presiding officer announces the following:
"At this time I will inquire of the administration as to whether
there have been any misstatements of fact or whether the
administration wishes to introduce any material as to subjects
raised by the proponents or opponents or alter in any regard
its initial recommendations."
(h) The presiding officer inquires as to whether any Council
members have any questions to ask the proponents,
opponents, speakers or administration. If any Council member
has questions, the appropriate individual will be recalled to the
podium.
(i) The presiding officer closes the public hearing.
(j) The presiding officer inquires if there is a motion by any
Council members. If a motion is made, it shall be in the form of
an affirmative motion. Following the motion and its second,
discussion occurs among Council members. The presiding
officer may call on individual Council members in the
discussion.
(k) The presiding officer inquires if there is any further discussion
by the Council members.
(l) The presiding officer inquires if there are any final comments
or recommendations from administration.
(m) The presiding officer inquires of the Council members as to
whether they are ready for the question.
(n) The Secretary shall conduct a roll call vote.
(o) The presiding officer directs administration to prepare findings
consistent with the action.
E. Voting.
(1) Rule 21. The votes during all meetings of the Council shall be
transacted as follows:
(a) Unless otherwise provided for by statute, ordinance or
resolution, all votes shall be taken by voice, except that at the
request of any Council member a roll call vote shall be taken by
the Clerk. The order of the roll call vote shall be determined
alphabetically with continuous rotation.
(b) In case of a tie in votes on any proposal, the Mayor shall cast
the tie-breaking vote. In the case where the Mayor is not
§ 16-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-3
1:30
present at the meeting and the vote occurs, the proposal shall
be considered lost.
(c) Every member who was in the Council chambers when the
question was put shall give his/her vote unless the Council, for
special reasons, shall excuse the member by motion or unless
the Council member is excused in accordance with Rule 15. If
any Council member declines to vote "aye" or "nay," his/her
vote shall be counted as an "aye" vote. Members may abstain.
(d) The passage of any ordinance, grant or revocation of franchise
or license, any resolution for the payment of money, any
approval of warrants and any resolution pertaining to
personnel actions shall require the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the whole membership of the Council.
(e) The passage of any motion or resolution not subject to the
provisions of state or local law, or these rules as amended, shall
require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
membership of the Council who are present and eligible to
vote.
F. Committees.
(1) Rule 22. The committee structure of the Council and the
procedures governing all committees shall be as follows:
(a) Committee of the whole. The only standing committee of the
Council shall be the Committee of the Whole (COW), composed
of the entire Council sitting as a legislative study committee.
The presiding officer chairs the COW.
(b) Council committees. The presiding officer, with concurrence of
Council, shall appoint such committees as needed to efficiently
operate the Borough.
(c) Special ad hoc Council study committees. Special ad hoc
Council study committees may be created by the Council for a
particular purpose or when the issue is so complex and timeconsuming
that it cannot be reasonably handled at a Council or
COW meeting. Council study committees shall consist of three
Council members appointed by the presiding officer. Special
Council committees shall sunset at the end of their mission, but
no later than the end of each calendar year, unless specifically
continued by the Council thereafter for a specified time period.
(d) The Borough Manager and respective department heads shall
strive to provide liaisons with additional information beyond
that normally provided to the Council as a whole and to keep
the liaisons abreast of developments, trends, conditions and
issues in the various functional areas of local government.
§ 16-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-3

(a) An enacted ordinance is a legislative act prescribing general,
uniform and permanent rules of conduct relating to the
corporate affairs of the Borough. Council action shall be taken
by ordinance when required by law or to prescribe permanent
rules of conduct which continue in force until repealed or
where such conduct is enforced by penalty.
(b) An enacted resolution is an internal legislative act which is a
formal statement of policy concerning matters of special or
temporary character. Council action shall be taken by
resolution when required by law and in those instances where
an expression of policy more formal than a motion is desired.
(c) An enacted motion is a form of action taken by the Council to
direct that a specific action be taken on behalf of the Borough.
A motion, once approved and entered into the record, is the
equivalent of a resolution in those instances where a resolution
is not required by law.
H. Ordinances.
(1) Rule 24. The procedures for ordinances are as follows:
(a) Except as otherwise prescribed by the Borough Code and any
other applicable laws, all ordinances shall be advertised once
in a newspaper of general circulation, not more than 60 days
nor less than seven days prior to the date of adoption. The title
§ 16-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-3
1:32
of each ordinance shall in all cases be read prior to its passage,
provided that, should a majority of the Council members
present request that the entire ordinance or certain of its
sections be read, such requests shall be granted. Printed
copies shall be made available upon request to any person
attending a Council meeting.
(b) Passage, approval and veto of ordinances. Every ordinance,
franchise and resolution of legislative character, except as
otherwise provided by the Borough Code, shall be presented to
the Mayor for his/her approval. If the Mayor approves, he/she
shall sign it, but if he/she shall not so approve, he/she shall
return it with his/her objections to Borough Council at the next
regular meeting of Council. The objections shall be entered
into the minutes of the proceedings of that meeting at which
the veto was announced. Borough Council shall reconsider
such ordinance at either that meeting or at any other meeting
of Council, but in no case later than 10 days thereafter. If
approved by a majority plus one of the membership of Council,
the ordinance shall become effective as if the Mayor had
signed.
(c) A Council member may, in open session, request of the
presiding officer that the Council study the wisdom of enacting
a particular ordinance. By affirmative motion, the Council may
assign the proposed ordinance to a specific committee or the
committee of the whole for study and consideration. The
committee shall report its findings to the Council.
(d) If a motion to pass an ordinance fails, the ordinance shall be
considered lost.
(e) Any ordinance amending or repealing any portion of the
municipal code (Borough of Sewickley Code of Ordinances)
shall also amend or repeal the respective portions of any
underlying ordinance(s).
I. Permission required to address the Council.
(1) Rule 25. Persons other than Council members and management
shall be permitted to address the Council upon recognition and
introduction by the presiding officer or the chair of the appropriate
Council committee, provided the provisions of Rule 33 have been
met.
J. Reconsideration.
(1) Rule 26. Any action of the Council, including final action on
applications for changes in land use status, but excluding a
reconsideration of any action previously reconsidered; motions to
adjourn; motions to suspend the rules; an affirmative vote to lay on
the table or to take from the table; or a vote electing to office one
§ 16-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-3
1:33
who is present and does not decline, shall be subject to a motion
to reconsider. Such motions can only be made by a member of
the prevailing side on the original action. A motion to reconsider
must be made no later than the next succeeding regular Council
meeting. A motion to reconsider is debatable only if the action
being reconsidered is debatable. Upon passage of a motion to
reconsider, the subject matter is returned to the table anew at the
next regular Council meeting for any action the Council deems
advisable.
K. Council relations with boards, commissions and advisory committees.
(1) Rule 27.
(a) All statutory boards and commissions and Council citizen
advisory bodies shall provide the Council with copies of any
minutes taken of meetings. Communications from such boards,
commissions and bodies to the Borough Council shall be
recorded in the minutes as follows.
(b) Any such communication shall be officially acknowledged by
the Council and receipt noted in the minutes. The procedure
for acknowledging such receipt shall be that the chief
administrative officer or any member of the Council may bring
such communication to the presiding officer's attention under
the agenda item "Committee and Board Reports." The
presiding officer shall state: "So noted for the record," and
thereafter the Clerk shall make an appropriate notation in the
minutes. Should any member of the Council determine that any
such communication be officially answered by the Council, the
presiding officer shall add the matter to the agenda or defer to
a subsequent meeting agenda.
L. Complaints and suggestions to Council.
(1) Rule 28. When citizen complaints or suggestions are brought
before the Borough Council, other than for items already on an
agenda, the presiding officer shall first determine whether the
issue is legislative or administrative in nature and then:
(a) If legislative, and a complaint about the letter or intent of
legislative acts or suggestions for changes to such acts, and if
the Council finds such complaint suggests a change to an
ordinance or resolution of the City, the Council may refer the
matter to a committee, the administration or the Council of the
whole for study and recommendation.
(b) If administrative, and a complaint regarding administrative
staff performance, administrative execution or interpretation
of legislative policy or administrative policy within the
authority of the chief administrative officer, the presiding
officer should then refer the complaint directly to the chief
§ 16-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-3
1:34
administrative officer for his/her review if said complaint has
not been so reviewed. The Borough Council may direct that the
chief administrative officer brief or report to the Council when
his/her response is made.
M. Filling Council vacancies.
(1) Rule 29. If a vacancy occurs in the office of Council member, the
Council will follow the procedures outlined in the Borough Code. In
order to fill the vacancy with the most qualified person available
until an election is held, the Council will widely distribute and
publish a notice of the vacancy, the procedure and any application
for applying. The Council will draw up an application form which
contains relevant information to answer set questions posed by the
Council. The application forms will be used in conjunction with an
interview of each candidate to aid the Council's selection of the
new Council member.

directed by the presiding officer.

legislative department of the annual Borough budget. Any Council
member who desires to expend Council travel funds, where the cost
of such travel, lodging and meals would exceed $100, shall submit
the request to Borough Council in writing. Upon receipt by the
chief administrative officer, the completed form will be put in the
Council packets for the next regular meeting. The chief
administrative officer shall bring the item to the floor under new
business, and the Council shall act to approve, disapprove or
modify the request.
P. Procedures for citizens addressing Council.
(1) Rule 32. The following procedures shall govern the presentation of
verbal and/or written communications to Borough Council at public
meetings held by Council.
(a) Recognition of individuals or groups wishing to make verbal or
written presentations to Borough Council.
[1] Any person/group wishing to address Borough Council at a
public meeting held by Borough Council shall be given a
time on the agenda of that meeting, such time not to
exceed five minutes in length, at which such presentation
shall be made to Council. Matters involving details that
will exceed the five-minute time limit shall be presented in
§ 16-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-3
1:35
writing, accompanied by a verbal overview not to exceed
the five-minute time limit. Cassette recordings may be
presented in place of a written document.
[2] Groups wishing to address Borough Council shall
designate a spokesperson to make all presentation and
discussion before Council. The individual representing the
group shall provide his/her name and address to be
entered into the minutes of such meeting prior to
addressing Council. The presenting individual shall be
responsible for maintaining the order of the group during
the presentation. Upon verbal petition to Borough Council
following the presentation by the group spokesperson,
Council may recognize up to two additional members of
the group, for a period of five minutes each, provided that
such additional presentation shall not be repetitious of the
group spokesperson. Borough Council shall not allow
additional debate by any individual attending the meeting.
Comments by individuals other than those which are
members of the group shall be governed by rules for
"individuals with standing," as outlined under Subsection
P(1)(b) of these rules.
[3] Borough Council may, at its own discretion, debate,
discuss and vote upon the matters presented in verbal
form. However, a motion to table shall place the matter on
the agenda for discussion at a later meeting to be held in
compliance with the State Sunshine Act.6 Motion to
remove from table in accordance with Robert's Rules of
Order is required. In the event of written material
presented to Borough Council, Council shall in all cases
table the matter until the next scheduled meeting to allow
all Council members adequate time for review of the
presented materials.
(b) Recognition of "individuals with standing" wishing to address
Borough Council on current topic.
[1] Any individual with standing before Borough Council may
request to be recognized during a public Borough Council
meeting, whenever such comment is relevant to the topic
currently on the table and being discussed by Council.
Upon such recognition, an individual, having his/her name
and address entered into the record of said meeting, shall
have five minutes to address Council, provided that such
discussion shall be relevant to the current topic being
discussed by Council. Borough Council shall provide the
recognized individual the right of free expression, without
interference from other individuals or groups present,
6. Editor's Note: See 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 701 et seq.
§ 16-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 16-3
1:36
Chapter 20
provided that such free expression shall be relevant to
the issue and that such expression shall be nonoffensive
in nature. Borough Council shall limit such verbal
presentation by individuals to the number of individuals
with new relevant comments concerning the topic. Council
shall not allow the recognition of individuals with
repetitious comment for the purpose of prolonging the
discussion. Upon the presentation of commentary on the
current topic, Borough Council, by motion, may table the
topic until the next public meeting of Borough Council.
Such action to table by Borough Council shall terminate
discussion on said topic until the next public Borough
Council meeting.
[2] During the presentation of any recognized individual
before Borough Council, Council shall ensure the right of
such presentation without interruption by others present.
In the event of the interruption of such presentation by
others present, Council shall ensure the discountenance of
such interruption in a parliamentary manner, including,
whenever necessary, the removal of such individuals from
Council Chambers. In the event such disruption cannot be
discontinued, Borough Council by motion shall temporarily
adjourn the proceedings until such time as order can be
restored. At such time as Council can reconvene the
meeting, the individual previously recognized shall have
the opportunity to address Borough Council on the topic
having been discussed prior to the adjournment, as if such
individual had just been recognized by Council.
(c) Recognition of "individuals without standing" wishing to
address Borough Council on current topic.
[1] Any individual without standing before Borough Council
may request to be recognized during a public Borough
Council meeting, whenever such comment is relevant to
the topic currently on the table and being discussed by
Council, provided that the individual requesting such
permission can demonstrate that his/her presentation is
offered as that of a "friend of the Council" and is of a
nature that will be beneficial to Borough Council in making
any determination necessary to the topic being discussed.
The President of Borough Council or any other Council
member shall make such determination of beneficial
content of the presentation. In the event recognition is
granted, such presentation shall be limited to a period of
no more than five minutes in length.

B.
Examination and Grading Procedure
§ 27-26. General examination requirements.
§ 27-27. Physical agility testing.
A. The examination for police officer shall consist of a physical agility test,
written examination, oral examination, and background investigation.
The written examination and the oral examination will be graded
individually on a 100% scale. The written examination will represent
70% of the final score. The oral examination will represent 30% of the
final score. The physical agility test and the background investigation
will be graded pass/fail.
B. The testing process will be as follows:
(1) Physical agility test. Those candidates passing the physical agility
test, as outlined in § 27-27, will qualify to take the written
examination.
Note: At the discretion of the Civil Service Commission, the written
examination may precede the physical agility testing.
(2) Written examination. Those candidates passing the written test, as
outlined in § 27-28, will qualify for the oral examination.
(3) Oral examination. Those candidates passing the oral examination,
as outlined in § 27-29, will then be placed on the eligibility list, after
those qualifying for veteran's preference points, as outlined in
§ 27-30, have been awarded those preference points.
(4) Background investigation. Prior to being considered for
appointment on the "certified list of three" the applicant will
undergo a complete background investigation as outlined in
§ 27-33. Although a requirement, only a sufficient number of topscoring
candidates necessary for consideration, as determined by
the Civil Service Commission, will need to have a background
investigation performed.
C. Thus, any individual appearing on the initial eligibility list is subject to
background investigation, and no one will be certified as eligible on the
"certified list of three" until they have successfully completed a
background investigation and received a written recommendation that
the applicant is appropriate for consideration in accordance with
§ 27-33 of these rules and regulations.
A. An applicant for the position of full-time police officer shall meet the
physical agility requirements, in accordance with the criteria
established by the Commission or other agencies designated by the
Commission. In all cases, candidates shall be provided with the physical
agility requirements prior to the time of physical agility testing.
§ 27-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-27
1:55
§ 27-28. Written examination.
The written examination shall be graded on a one-hundred-point scale,
and an applicant must score 70% or higher and receive one of the top 15
highest scores or a fewer number than 15, if less than 15 have passed the
written test, including ties, in order to continue in the application process.
Applicants scoring less than 70% or not receiving one of the top 15 highest
scores or a fewer number who may have passed the written test shall be
rejected. Within 30 days after the administration of the written examination,
all applicants shall be given written notice of their test results and passing
applicants shall be scheduled for an oral examination appointment.
§ 27-29. Oral examination.
Every applicant who scored 70% or higher and received one of the top 15
highest scores, or a fewer number than 15 if fewer than 15 have passed
the written test, including ties, shall be given an oral examination. The oral
examination will be graded on a one-hundred-point scale with a score of
70% or higher necessary for passing. The oral examination shall involve
questioning applicants on how they would handle situations relevant to
police work. Within 30 days after the applicants' oral examination, they shall
be informed of the score in their oral examination and total overall score.
§ 27-30. Veteran's preference points.
Pursuant to the Veterans' Preference Act, any applicant for the position
of police officer who qualifies as a military veteran under this Act, shall
receive an additional 10 points on top of their final score if that applicant
qualifies under §§ 27-27, 27-28 and 27-29 of these rules and regulations.
Applicants claiming veteran's preference shall have submitted satisfactory
proof of service and honorable discharge therefrom with their application.
B. Applicants who have successfully passed or failed the physical agility
test will be so notified at the completion of the physical agility test or
within 30 days by the Commission.

C.
Eligibility List and Background Investigation
§ 27-31. Creation of eligibility list.
§ 27-32. Duration of eligibility list.
The eligibility list for full-time police officers will be valid for a period of one
year from the date the Commission formally adopts the eligibility list. Prior
to expiration of the one-year period, the Commission may extend the validity
of the eligibility list for up to an additional 12 months by a majority vote of
the Commission at a duly authorized Commission meeting. In the absence
of a lawful extension by the Commission, the list shall expire.
§ 27-33. Background investigation.
A. At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in §§ 27-27,
27-28 and 27-29, the physical agility test, the written examination and
the oral examination, the Commission shall rank all passing candidates
on the eligibility list. The applicants having received the highest score
shall be at the top of their respective lists, with all other candidates
being listed in descending order of their scores. Applicants who qualify
for veteran's preference points, as outlined in § 27-30, shall have those
10 points added to their final score prior to being ranked on the
eligibility list.
B. In the case of tied scores, the tie will be broken by giving preference to
the applicant who received the highest score on the written test. In the
event the qualifying applicant received identical scores, the order of
listing shall be determined by the order in which they were numbered
for recording purposes.
C. Any individual appearing on the eligibility list is subject to a
background investigation, and no one will be certified in accordance
with § 27-33 of these rules and regulations until they have successfully
completed a background investigation and received a written
recommendation that the applicant is appropriate for consideration in
accordance with § 27-33 of these rules and regulations.
A. The Commission shall request the Chief of Police or the Chief's
designee to conduct a background investigation on the top-scoring
eligible applicants, as determined by the Civil Service Commission,
prior to inclusion on the "certified list of three" of those eligible as set
forth in § 27-34 of these rules and regulations.
B. The background investigation must be consistent for each applicant and
shall meet, at a minimum, all the specific requirements of the MPOETC,
as required by law. The applicant may be interviewed directly when the
information collected requires clarification or further explanation. The
Chief of Police or Chief's designee may use his/her own discretion in the
expansion or contracting of these items and time frames.
§ 27-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-33
1:57
C. After the background investigation is completed, the Chief of Police or
the Chief's designee shall make a written recommendation to the
Commission on whether the applicant is appropriate for consideration
for appointment as a police officer for the Borough of Sewickley.
D. The recommendation by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall
be based on the criteria set forth in § 27-24 of these rules and
regulations and on any other relevant information developed during the
background investigation. This report to the Commission shall be in
writing and in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and
must not include any physical history information on a candidate. If the
recommendation is to disqualify, then a detailed written explanation of
the reasons for disqualification must be included. The Commission shall
then make a final determination on whether additional information is
required or if the information collected and reported warrants
acceptance or rejection of the candidate.
E. Within 30 days after the Commission considers the recommendation
based on the background investigation, each applicant shall be notified
as to whether they have passed or failed this portion of the examination
process.

D.
Appointment Procedure
§ 27-34. Appointing authority.
§ 27-35. Physical and psychological medical examinations.
A. Furloughed police officers shall be given first consideration for
reemployment, prior to any other hiring procedure and shall be
reinstated in order of their seniority as outlined in § 27-56 of these rules
and regulations.
(1) Except as provided above, every initial position of full-time police
officer for employment in the Police Department shall be filled only
in the following manner: The appointing authority shall notify the
Commission of any vacancy which is to be filled and shall request
certification of the top three names from the eligibility list.
(2) If there are less than three names on the eligibility list, then the
Commission shall certify the name(s) remaining on the list.
(3) The appointing authority shall make an appointment from one of
the three names certified, or a lesser number certified, with
reference to the merits and fitness of the candidates. However, for
the initial appointment to the position full-time police officer, when
one of the three applicants on the certified list qualifies as a
"soldier" under the Veteran's Preference Act, and subsequent case
law, that applicant shall be selected. If there are two or more
applicants that qualify as "soldiers," as defined above, on the
"certified list of three," the appointing authority shall have the
discretion to appoint the "soldier" it deems most qualified.
B. The appointing authority may object to one or more of the persons
certified for the reasons set forth in § 27-24 of these rules and
regulations. If the candidate to whom the appointing authority objects
or fails to timely exercise the rights of appeal under § 27-25 or if the
Commission declines to uphold the appeal, the Commission shall strike
that name from the eligibility list and certify the next highest name for
inclusion on the certified list of three candidates for each name stricken
off the "certified list of three."
A. After the Borough Council selects a candidate from the "certified list of
three" for appointment to the vacant position, that candidate shall
receive a conditional offer of employment. The offer of employment
shall be conditioned upon the conditional appointee undergoing a
physical and psychological medical examination and a determination
that the conditional appointee is capable of performing all the essential
functions of the position. Physical medical examinations shall be under
the direction of a physician or other qualified medical professional.
Psychological medical examinations shall be under the direction of a
psychiatrist or psychologist.
§ 27-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-35
1:59
§ 27-36. Probationary period.
B. The physician or other qualified medical professional and the
psychiatrist or psychologist shall be appointed by Council and shall
render an opinion as to whether the conditional appointee has a
physical or mental condition which calls into question the person's
ability to perform all of the essential functions of the position for which
the person was conditionally appointed.
C. The physical and psychological exams will be conducted in compliance
with the MPOETC regulations. The completion of the required MPOETC
physical and psychological forms will be provided by the Borough. Drug
testing shall be included as one component of the requirements. In
addition, the respective examiners will be given a copy of the job
description and the "essential functions of the job" for performing the
duties of a police officer. The completed forms will be certified by the
examining physician(s), indicating that the candidate is physically or
psychologically fit, as the case may be, to perform the duties of a police
officer. The completed forms shall be confidential and submitted to the
appropriate Borough official for disposition.
D. If the opinion rendered by the physician, other qualified medical
professional, psychiatrist or psychologist calls into question the
conditional appointee's ability to perform all essential functions of a
position, a person designated by Borough Council shall meet with the
conditional appointee for the purpose of having one or more interactive
discussions on whether the conditional appointee can, with or without
reasonable accommodation, perform all the essential functions of the
position.
E. If at the conclusion of the interactive discussion the Borough
determines that the conditional appointee is not qualified, the Borough
Council shall give written notice to the conditional appointee and the
Commission.
F. The rejected candidate may appeal this decision under § 27-25 of these
rules and regulations. If the candidate fails to timely exercise the rights
of appeal, or if the Commission declines to uphold the appeal, the
Commission shall strike the name from the eligibility list and certify the
next highest name for inclusion on the "certified list of three."
A. Every successful applicant for the position of police officer shall serve a
twelve-month probationary period. For newly hired police officers, the
probationary period will begin on the first day the new officer reports
for work. During this probationary period, a newly hired police officer
may only be dismissed for cause for the reasons set forth in § 27-24 of
these rules and regulations or because of incapacity for duty due to the
use of alcohol or drugs. In addition, a probationary police officer may be
dismissed if the probationary police officer does not meet the
requirements/expectations of the position and documentation is
accurately noted.
§ 27-35 SEWICKLEY CODE § 27-36
1:60
§ 27-37. Optional provision.
The appointing authority of the Borough may fill a vacancy in an existing
position in the Police Department which occurs as a result of retirement,
resignation, disability or death by the reappointment or reinstatement of
a former employee of the Police Department who had previously complied
with the civil service rules and regulations. The officer's reappointment
is subject to any recertification requirements prescribed by the MPOETC.
In addition, the officer shall successfully pass a physical agility test,
background investigation, and a psychological and medical examination.
§ 27-38. Provisional appointment.
Whenever there are urgent reasons for the filling of a vacancy in any
position in the Police Department and there are no names on the eligibility
list for such appointment, the Borough Council may nominate a person to
the Commission for a noncompetitive examination. Such nominee may be
certified by the Commission after the nominee successfully passes such
noncompetitive examination. However, prior to being subject to a
noncompetitive test, the provisional appointee shall be subject to any
recertification requirements prescribed by the MPOETC. In addition, the
officer shall successfully pass a physical agility test, background
investigation, and a psychological and medical examination, as required by
the MPOETC. He may then be appointed provisionally to fill such vacancy.
It shall thereupon become the duty of the Commission, within 30 days,
B. The Chief of Police shall submit a final probationary report not less than
10 days nor more than 15 calendar days before the next regular
meeting of the Borough Council immediately preceding the end of the
probationary period. Each report shall be submitted in writing to the
Borough Council. Within five calendar days after receiving a
probationary report from the Chief of Police, if the conduct of the
probationer has not been satisfactory to the Borough Council, the
probationer shall be notified in writing by the Borough Council that the
appointment will not be permanent. Following receipt of this
notification by the probationer, a newly hired police officer's
employment shall end. Any probationer who is notified in writing by the
Borough Council prior to completion of the twelve-month probation
period that his appointment will not be made permanent has no rights
of appeal under these rules and regulations.
C. The Borough Manager shall notify the Commission, in writing, of its
decision to retain or remove the probationer within five calendar days
of such decision and in no event beyond the last day of the probationary
period.
D. After the end of the twelve-month probationary period, if the
probationer is not notified in accordance with this section, a newly
hired police officer shall receive permanent status in his or her
respective promotional position.

to begin the process for a competitive examination and related tests,
investigations and examinations as outlined in these rules and regulations.
An eligibility list will then be established and a certified list of three names
will be presented to the Borough Council, from which a regular appointment
shall be made. Nothing in this section shall prevent the appointment,
without examination, of persons temporarily assigned the full duties of a
police officer for the Borough of Sewickley in cases of riots or other such
emergencies.

§ 27-54. Hearings on suspension, removals or reductions in rank.
Any officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank may
appeal the decision of the Borough Council by requesting a hearing with
the Civil Service Commission. In the event an officer aggrieved by such
a decision is entitled by a collective bargaining agreement to pursue a
grievance on the matter, the officer must elect to pursue the matter either
under the processes in place under the collective bargaining agreement or
under these rules and regulations. Once an election of remedies is made,
the alternate procedure is waived. When chosen, the civil service hearing
process is as follows:
B. Within five days after the Borough Council has voted to impose the
disciplinary action, a written statement of the charges shall be
delivered to the officer either by personal service or by certified
registered mail. In addition, the charges shall notify the officer of the
right to appeal under § 57-54 of these rules and regulations. A copy of
the statement of charges shall also be served upon the members of the
Civil Service Commission within the same allotted time.
A. The hearing request must be received in writing by the Secretary of the
Commission at 601 Thorn Street, Sewickley, PA 15143, within 10 days
after the police officer received notice of the discipline. The officer may
make written answers to any charges filed not later than the date fixed
for the hearing. Failure of the officer to provide written answers to any
of the charges shall not be deemed an admission by the officer. The
Commission shall schedule a hearing within 10 days from the officer's
written request for a hearing unless continued by the Commission for
cause at the request of the Commission, the Borough Council or the
officer. Notwithstanding this provision, the failure of the Commission to
hold a hearing within 10 days from the filing of the charges in writing
shall not result in the dismissal of the charges filed.
B. At any hearing, the officer against whom the charges have been made
may be present and represented by counsel, may call witnesses and
present testimony and documentation in defense. The Borough may
also be represented by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as
is necessary to support the charges. A stenographic record of all
testimony shall be taken at every hearing and preserved by the
Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record shall be
sealed and not be available for public inspection.
C. In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of review shall
be to determine whether sufficient evidence has been presented to
support the statutory reason for the disciplinary action. If the
Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been introduced to
support the charge, the Commission shall not modify the penalty
imposed by the Borough Council unless it finds that the penalty
imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory or an abuse of the Board's
discretion. In considering the appropriateness of the discipline, the
Commission shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Borough

issue a written decision containing specific findings of fact and
conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the hearing transcript.
D. In the event that the Commission fails to uphold the charges, then the
officer shall be reinstated with full pay for the period of the suspension,
removal or reduction in rank. No charges related to the suspension,
removal or reduction in rank shall be officially recorded in the officer's
official personnel records, nor may any of these charges be held against
the officer for future merit pay raises or promotional opportunities.
A. All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the
Chairperson, or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the Vice
Chairperson. The Commission shall have the power to issue subpoenas
as set forth in § 27-15 of these rules and regulations.
B. Unless the Council or the person sought to be suspended, removed or
reduced in rank requests that the proceedings before the Commission
be open to the public, the proceedings before the Commission pursuant
to this section shall be held in the nature of a closed executive session
that shall not be open to the public. Any such request shall be presented
to the Commission before the civil service hearing commences. The
deliberations of the Commission, including interim rulings on
evidentiary or procedural issues, may be held in private and shall not be
subject to a request for being open to the public, the Council or to the
person sought to be suspended, removed or reduced in rank. The
Commission's disposition of the disciplinary action shall constitute
official action, which shall occur at a public meeting held pursuant to 65
Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 7 (relating to open meetings).
C. All parties concerned shall have an immediate right of appeal to the
Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and the case shall be
determined as the Court deems proper. No order of suspension made by
the Commission shall be for a longer period than one year. The appeal
with the Court of Common Pleas shall be taken within 30 days from the
date of entry by the Commission of its final order and shall be by
petition. Upon the appeal being taken and docketed, the Court of
Common Pleas shall fix a day for the hearing and shall proceed to hear
the appeal on the original record and additional proof of testimony as
the parties concerned may desire to offer in evidence. The decision of
the Court affirming or revising the decision of the Commission shall be
final, and the officer shall be suspended, discharged, reduced in rank or
reinstated in accordance with the order of the Court.

be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order, commencing with
the person last appointed, until such reduction shall have been
accomplished.
B. In the event that the Borough Council decides to increase the number of
the Police Department's officer personnel, the furloughed police
officers shall be reinstated in order of their seniority in the Police
Department. Employees so notified of reinstatement must accept
reinstatement within 30 days of receipt of such notice; otherwise such
employee shall be deemed to have waived any right to reinstatement.

Chapter 163
CURFEW
§ 163-1. Legislative findings.
The Council of the Borough of Sewickley finds as follows:
A. The Borough is unusually compact with an area of approximately one
square mile.
B. Most of the land in the Borough is devoted to residential use. The
Borough also contains a well-patronized business area and several
institutional or civic uses, such as the Sewickley Valley Hospital and the
YMCA.
C. The Borough has developed and maintained a quiet, stable, familyoriented
type of residential environment.
D. A number of incidents have recently occurred wherein groups of youths
under age 18 have intimidated, threatened, harassed and physically
attacked individuals on Borough streets and sidewalks or have
damaged property in the commercial district at night.
E. These incidents have deprived those individuals who were so intimated,
threatened, harassed and attacked of their constitutional rights to
freely walk, stroll or otherwise move at will through the Borough.
F. Because of the Borough's compact area, these incidents have caused
citizens throughout the Borough to become concerned for their safety
while outside at night, and these incidents have had a chilling effect
upon the exercise of citizens' constitutional rights to walk, stroll or
otherwise move at will through the Borough at night.
G. These incidents have impaired the quiet residential atmosphere and
environment prized by the Borough citizens.
H. A large percentage of Borough residents are elderly and are especially
threatened by groups of youths on the street at night.
I. The Borough's largest employer, Sewickley Valley Hospital, has a
substantial number of employees going to and from the hospital at
night, of which the majority are female persons who may be especially
subject to intimidation, threats or harassment by youths on the streets
at night.
J. A curfew would have permitted easier detection and dispersal of the
youths who caused the said incidents.
K. A curfew would increase the safety of citizens, and particularly elderly
and female persons, lawfully exercising their rights to use and enjoy
Borough streets at night and would diminish the chilling effect upon
their exercise of such rights that has resulted from the said incidents.
§ 156-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-1
1:125
§ 163-2. Definitions.
L. The Borough provides through its parks and streets ample
opportunities for all minors to associate and congregate and socialize
and move about with others during noncurfew hours.
M. The Borough Council finds that, because of the particular vulnerability
of minors, their inability to make critical decisions in an informed,
mature manner, and the importance of the parental role in childrearing,
a juvenile curfew ordinance is necessary to protect the
Borough's youths.
N. The Borough Council recognizes that, in conjunction with the exercise
of its police powers, it must uphold and protect the constitutional
freedoms provided to each citizen, including minors, under the state
and federal constitutions.
O. Because of the increasing incidents of juvenile crime, especially gangand
drug-related activities in Pittsburgh and other area municipalities,
the Borough Council finds that a curfew is necessary to prevent and/or
limit the occurrence of such incidents in the Borough.
A. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:

right-of-way open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
or pedestrian travel, including any opened street as defined in the
Borough Code, 8 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 101.1 and 1701. The term "street" also
applies for curfew purposes to ways the public is privileged to use
over private property so long as the owner permits, including sidewalks
and grass plots similarly open to public use, and public parking lots or
areas.
B. In this chapter, the singular shall include the plural; the plural shall

countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of such minor, with their

Department office. The minor's parents shall be contacted and notified to
come for the minor, who shall then be released into parental custody. Where
a minor's parents are not readily available or in other cases where taking
the minor to the police station would be in the officer's best judgment
impractical, inefficient or otherwise interfere with other police duties, the
police officer may deliver the minor to his residence. Both the parent(s) and
the offending minor shall be given an initial verbal warning of the violation
and a copy of this chapter. A report shall be filed and kept in a book for that
specific purpose.

cited for the violation and subject to the penalty provisions contained in this

Statutory Authorization
§ 178-1. Statutory authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,20 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Sewickley does hereby
order as follows.

General Provisions
§ 178-2. Intent.

§ 178-3. Applicability.
§ 178-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be

provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.

structures.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter

ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Sewickley or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that

59.22.
B. In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain
Administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the Code Enforcement
Officer.

review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been
obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities
Act (Act 1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended); the Pennsylvania
Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and the U.S. Clean
Water Act, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall be issued
until this determination has been made.

completion of the work as are necessary.
E. In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or
development in the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 178-16. Identification.
§ 178-17. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Borough of Sewickley classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
(2) Any community identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Sewickley and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 178-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 178-17
1:143
§ 178-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 178-21B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 178-19. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Sewickley and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where the
Borough of Sewickley has identified local flood hazard or ponding
areas, as delineated and adopted on a "local flood hazard map" using
best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
§ 178-17 SEWICKLEY CODE § 178-20
1:144
§ 178-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

(1) No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance

General Provisions
§ 280-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Sewickley
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 280-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 280-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 280-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated
runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the
protection of people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by
using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1)
infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices
and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of predevelopment
hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
§ 280-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-3
1:261
§ 280-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,33 as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act, 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended,
The Stormwater Management Act.
§ 280-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 280-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 280-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the
municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

§ 280-3 SEWICKLEY CODE § 280-8
1:262
§ 280-8. Compatibility with Other Requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 280-9. Erroneous Permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 280-10. Waivers.
A. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 280-10B. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification
or waiver shall originate with the landowner, shall be in writing, and
shall accompany the stormwater management site plan submitted to
the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the
request is based, the provisions of the ordinance involved, and the
proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer shall review the
request to determine if it meets the requirements of this chapter,
including Subsection B below. If acceptable to the municipality, the
municipality may grant the waiver or modification.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the
land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or
detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome, and that the purpose of the ordinance is preserved. Hardship
must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and
not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Stormwater Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden
shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany
the Stormwater Management Site Plan submission, as directed in
§ 280-10A above.
C. No walver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality.
§ 280-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-10
1:263
§ 280-11. Version of regulations and standards.
Any reference to a statute, regulation or standard shall be interpreted to
refer to the latest or most current version of that document.
§ 280-12. Disclaimer of liability.
D. This section shall not apply to requests for waiver or modification to the
provisions of Article V, Design Criteria. All requests for waivers or
modifications from Article V shall be reviewed by the municipality for
applications of any size earth disturbance.
A. For regulatory purposes, the degree of stormwater management sought
by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable. This chapter
shall not impose upon the municipality any legal duty in addition to
those duties otherwise imposed under the Stormwater Management
Act34 upon the municipality, any appointed or elected official, employee
or representative of the municipality. It is not the intention of the
municipality to guarantee the elimination of harm resulting from
stream flow, floods, rain, snow, or stormwater runoff; or erosion
resulting therefrom. It is the intention of the municipality to create
reasonable stormwater management regulations which balance several
competing interests in an appropriate fashion with the emphasis on
public safety.
B. This chapter does not imply that areas within or outside any identified
flood-prone area will be free from flooding or flood damages.
C. Neither the granting of any approval under this chapter, nor the
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or with any condition
imposed by the municipality or a municipality official hereunder, shall
relieve any person from any responsibility for damage to persons or
property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor
impose any liability upon the municipality for damages to person or
property.
D. The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty
of any kind by the municipality, or by an official, employee, or
consultant thereof, of the practicability or safety of any structure, use,
or other plan proposed, and shall create no liability upon or cause of
action against the municipality, or an official, employee, or consultant
thereof, for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.

167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the "Storm Water
Management Act."
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture
such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal
heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including
tillage, land clearing, plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting
crops or pasturing and raising of livestock and installation of
conservation measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious
area is not considered an "agricultural activity."
APPLICANT  A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an
application to the municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the municipality.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one
of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural."
In this chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational
and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
§ 280-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-13
1:265
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  A conservation district, as defined in
Section 3(c) of the Conservation District Law [3 P. S. § 851(c)] that
has the authority under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to
administer and enforce all or a portion of the regulations promulgated
under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
DEP  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM  The magnitude and temporal distribution of
precipitation from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence
(e.g., a five-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design
and evaluation of stormwater management systems. Also see "return
period."
DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER  A qualified professional as defined
herein, or organization such as the Allegheny County Conservation
District, that has been designated by the municipality to be the
reviewer of SWM site plans for the municipality, and shall be
understood to be the reviewer where indicated as the municipality
within this chapter.
DETENTION BASIN  An impoundment designed to collect and retard
stormwater runoff by temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at a
predetermined rate. Detention basins are designed to drain completely
in a designed period after a rainfall event, and to become dry until the
next rainfall event.
DETENTION VOLUME  The volume of runoff that is captured and
released into the waters of the commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)  See "project site."
DISTURBED AREA  An unstabilized land area where an earth

from any natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and
studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that
comprise Group 13 Soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania
DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary
of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies
provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is assumed-absent
evidence to the contrary-that the floodway extends from the stream to
50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and
activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include
conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management
plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and
construction, timber harvesting, site preparation, and reforestation.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  Systems and practices that use or mimic
natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on
the site where it is generated.
GROUNDWATER  Water beneath the earth's surface that supplies
wells and springs and is within the saturated zone of soil and rock.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE  The replenishment of existing natural
underground water supplies from precipitation or overland flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Infiltration rates of soils vary
widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D)
according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare
soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group
classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be
identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local
NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious
as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS1,2).35
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor
living spaces, patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and
any new streets or sidewalks. Decks, parking areas, and driveway areas
are counted as impervious areas if they directly prevent infiltration. Any
35.Editor's Note: See Article X, References.
§ 280-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-13
1:267
surface areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
assumed to be impervious surfaces. In addition, any surface designed
to be constructed of permeable, pervious or porous concrete, asphalt,
or pavers shall be considered an impervious surface.
INFILTRATION  Movement of surface water into the soil, where it is
absorbed by plant roots, evaporated into the atmosphere, or percolated
downward to recharge groundwater.
INVASIVE SPECIES  DCNR defines invasive plants as those species
that are not native to the state, grow aggressively, and spread and
displace native vegetation (see http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/

the following meanings: () the improvement of one lot or two or more
contiguous lots, tracts, or parcels of land for any purpose involving (a)
a group of two or more buildings or (b) the division or allocation of
land or space between or among two or more existing or prospective
occupants by means of, or for the purpose of streets, common areas,
leaseholds, condominiums, building groups, or other features; (ii) any
subdivision of land; (iii) development in accordance with Section
503(1.1) of the PA Municipalities Planning Code.36
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and
small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of
rainwater. LID can be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and
revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate,
filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely
on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses
stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features
located on-site.

below. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below, or
alternative design criteria as allowed by PA Code Title 25, Chapter 102.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual3)50 is applicable as
a method to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions. The following shall be incorporated
into the CG-1 method:
(1) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a forty-eight-to-seventy-two-hour dewatering
time in an area with a dedicated stormwater system (not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in
a facility designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to
local stormwater systems or the environment. Justification, as
prepared and sealed by a qualified professional, for assertion that
permanent removal is not feasible must be provided, at a minimum,
in the form of field measured infiltration rate testing and
geotechnical evaluation of the existing site soils with regard to the
impact of proposed infiltration. Applications omitting this
justification, including infiltration rate testing will be considered
incomplete. BMPs proposing use of extended detention in lieu of
permanent reduction through the listed methods shall include a
valve to adjust or regulate dewatering time to achieve the
performance standards noted herein. The valve system shall
include an inspection/monitoring port for review of dewatering.
(3) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing
conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual3) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm

§ 280-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-16
1:275
§ 280-17. Rate controls.
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area
with a dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a
combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility designed
for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a
combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater
systems or the environment.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 280-17, Rate
Controls, if the project qualifies for exemption by the provisions of
§ 280-15A.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: Postdevelopment discharge rates shall
not exceed 90% of the pre-development discharge rates for the one-,
two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour
storm events. This is the equivalent to a 90% release rate area when
compared to those rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix A
(Release Rate Management Districts): This pre-development to
postdevelopment control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the
"Conditional Direct Discharge" areas on the Release Rate maps. For
comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to 1/10 cubic foot
per second (cfs). If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated
by the postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates
of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-, two-,
five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storms,
then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the
peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak flows should be computed
using the methods included in the chapter titled "Stormwater
Calculations and Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater Management
§ 280-16 SEWICKLEY CODE § 280-17
1:276
§ 280-18. Riparian buffers.
BMP Manual; except, however, where documented downstream
flooding problems exist, the municipality may impose a 50% reduced
release rate criteria.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events, the
postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable
approved release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A
(Release Rate Management Districts) of this chapter. For comparison of
peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to 1/10 cubic foot per second
(cfs). For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the
postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams; keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. Except as required by PA Code Title 25, Chapter 102, the riparian
buffer easement shall be required for all streams (as defined in Article
II) with a contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The
riparian buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet
from the top of the streambank (on each side).
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in § 280-18A.
(2) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(3) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
§ 280-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 280-18
1:277
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning
Ordinance.51
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical
distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not
permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
G. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the municipality within riparian
buffers:
(1) It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for
nonmotorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted
provided they have adequate drainage.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest
practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as
required.

F. Time of concentration: The minimum time of concentration for any
watershed shall be six minutes. A minimum six-minute time of
concentration may be assumed for any postdevelopment watershed.
Calculations must be provided for all pre-development times of
concentrations. A minimum time of concentration cannot be assumed
for predevelopment conditions.
G. The use of the Basic Rational Method in estimating runoff may be
employed in the design of the storm sewer conveyance system within
the development. The storm sewer system shall be interpreted as the
conduits, culverts, inlets and appurtenant features for the conveying of
stormwater to, through or from a development site to the point of final
discharge or control facility. The Rational Method shall not be used in
the analysis of stormwater runoff from the development in its entirety
or in conjunction with the design of any retention/detention facilities or
other runoff control measures.
H. Points of interest for analysis of pre- and postdevelopment runoff must
be selected to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
§§ 280-17 and 280-18 is achieved at all points where runoff exits the
perimeter of the property.
I. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another unless the watersheds are subareas of a larger watershed that
are tributary to a common point of interest within or near the perimeter
of the property. Transfer of runoff from one watershed to another under
any other circumstances shall only be approved at the discretion of the
municipality. Documentation shall be provided that peak flow rates are
not increased following development and there will be no detrimental
impact in downstream areas.
J. The Stormwater Management Plan shall consider all of the stormwater
runoff flowing over the project site. Runoff calculations shall be made to
ensure that runoff from the upstream watershed area can be
accommodated by the pipes, drainage easements and watercourses,
etc. on the site.
A. All stormwater collection and conveyance facilities (pipes, swales, and
structures) shall be designed for a 100-year design storm event unless
the runoff would naturally drain overland to a stormwater detention

facility, in which case a twenty-five-year design storm event may be
used. The hydraulic gradeline must be a minimum of two feet below
the surface elevation within the pipe. Swales and channels shall provide
at least one foot of freeboard above the energy gradeline. Backwater
effects of pipes discharging under surcharge conditions shall be
included.
B. Runoff calculations shall include complete hydrology and hydraulic
analysis of all downstream swales and pipe facilities to permanent
stream discharge point, to the municipal boundary or connection to a
state- or county-owned conveyance system.
C. Manholes shall not be spaced more than 350 feet apart for pipe sizes up
to 24 inches In diameter and not more than 450 feet apart for larger
pipe sizes.
D. No public stormwater pipe that conveys surface runoff shall be less
than 15 inches in diameter. The minimum pipe slope shall be 1.0%
grade or maintain velocity of two feet per second. For public storm
sewer systems, only pipes related to construction of stormwater BMPs
may be less than 15 inches in diameter.

Roadway Construction. Inlet grates shall be bicycle-safe. Frames and
grates shall be cast iron or structural steel. Concrete frames shall not
be permitted.
G. All connections to existing storm sewer pipes shall be made by
construction of a suitable junction box (inlet or manhole) to provide
access for cleanout. No blind connections shall be permitted.
H. The discharge of stormwater runoff shall be to a well-defined drainage
course, which has a defined bed and bank. If stormwater runoff cannot
be discharged to a defined drainage course, documentation of written
permission from each downstream property owner shall be provided for
all properties between the source of discharge and the defined drainage
course. The use of level spreaders or similar BMPs that promote sheet
flow may be permitted if the applicant provides documentation that the
peak postdevelopment 100-year discharge is no greater than predevelopment
two-year discharge and a letter from the geotechnical
engineer of record regarding slope stability of the downstream area is
provided. Use of a level spreader requires a waiver to be granted by the
municipality.

§ 280-32. Special Stormwater Facility Maintenance Fund.
A. Persons installing post-construction stormwater management BMP
facilities will be required to pay a specified amount to the Municipal
Stormwater Facility Maintenance Fund to help defray the costs of
periodic inspections and annual maintenance expenses. The amount of
the deposit shall be determined as follows:
(1) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained, the
deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by
the municipality for a period of 20 years, as estimated by the
municipality. After that period of time, inspections will be
performed by the municipality and billed directly to the owner.
(2) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
municipality, the deposit shall cover the estimated annual costs for
maintenance and inspections for 20 years, as estimated by the
municipality.
(3) The amount of the deposit to the maintenance fund covering annual
inspection and maintenance costs shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The municipality manager shall
determine the present-worth equivalents, which shall be subject to
the final approval of the municipality supervisors.
B. If the storage facility is proposed which also serves as a recreation
facility, such as a lake or ballfield, the municipality may reduce or waive
the amount of the maintenance fund based on the value of the land for
public recreation purposes.
C. If at some future time any storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or another
storage facility (i.e., a distributed storage facility), the unused portion
of the maintenance fund will be applied to the cost of abandoning the
facility and connecting to the storm sewer system or other facility. Any
amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment are
paid will be returned to the depositor.

Sidewalks for the use of pedestrians shall be built and maintained by
the owners in front of all lots abutting on all highways regularly used
by pedestrians within the Borough in accordance with the widths, lines,
grades, slopes and specifications furnished by or through the Borough
Manager. All data necessary to construct, re-lay or repair may be obtained
at the office of the Borough Manager. Sidewalks, including all the space
between the property line and the curbline or vehicular driveway, even
though the entire space be not paved as a walkway for pedestrians, shall
always be maintained in a safe, unobstructed and usable condition by the
owners, except as otherwise provided by existing ordinance. This safety
requirement shall apply to all trees, shrubbery, structures and portable
materials placed or permitted to exist under, on or in the space between
the property line and the vehicular driveway, including the adequate
safeguarding of any work done within the side space. Sidewalks shall be
kept clean and free of snow, ice, leaves and any other structure or substance
which may obstruct the view of motorists or others or cause inconvenience
or injury to pedestrians.
§ 287-2. Sidewalk and curb specifications. [Added 4-23-1951 by
Ord. No. 707; amended 9-25-1974 by Ord. No. 928]
New and relaid sidewalks or curbs, whether laid by the abutter or by
the Borough, shall be of a minimum of 2,000 pound concrete, but an
abutter may receive from Council permission to use material equivalent
in durability and usefulness to the public. Sidewalks shall be at least four
inches in thickness, with a slope of approximately 1/4 inch to a foot. Curbs
shall be six inches in thickness and 24 inches from top to bottom. The
sidewalk shall be so set that it shall have proper drainage over the curb.
Upon reasonable cause shown, Council may change the foregoing
specifications. At intersections or driveways, curbs and sidewalks shall

an amount sufficient to the Borough to cover the costs of such
improvement(s) or common amenities.
C. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost completion
estimated by the landowner and/or developer. Annually, the Borough

cost of the improvement(s) which have been completed and the
estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvement(s) as
of the expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
§ 292-307 SEWICKLEY CODE § 292-309
1:354
§ 292-310. Final release from improvement guarantee.
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
the annual adjustment, the Borough may require the landowner and/
or developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals 110%.

estimate and make a recommendation to the Borough Council as to
acceptance and may provide an estimate if deemed unacceptable.

and the Borough. The estimate by the third engineer shall be
deemed as the final estimate.
(2) If a third engineer is selected, the fees for services shall be evenly
divided between the applicant and the Borough.
E. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
equal to 110% of the revised cost of completing the improvement(s) as
established on or about the one-year anniversary of the original
posting. The revised costs shall be determined by using the same
manner as described for the initial financial security.
F. When the Borough accepts dedication of all or some of the required
improvement(s) following completion, the Borough Council shall
require the posting of financial security to secure the structural
integrity of the improvement(s) in accordance with the design and

work claimed to be completed and the amount of security requested to
be released.
C. The Borough shall have 45 days from receipt of such request to have

portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification, the
Borough shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed, or if the
Borough fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the release of
funds shall be deemed approved. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Borough may, prior to final release at the time of
completion and certification by its appointed Engineer, require
retention of 10% of the estimated cost of improvements.

§ 292-510. Street trees.
Street trees installed within the Borough shall comply with the Borough of
Sewickley Tree Commission and Tree Ordinance; see Chapter 267, Shade
Trees.
§ 292-511. Development on private streets discouraged.
§ 292-512. Open space, lot siting, planting and beautification for
subdivision and land developments.
accordance with the established tree pattern of the street(s) on which
the lot exists.
C. Screening. Wherever natural screening is being planted to meet a
screening requirement of the Borough Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 330
of the Code, such screen shall consist of 50% evergreen or evergreentype
hedges and 50% shrubs and deciduous trees interplanted with a
variety and size, at the time of planting, that will attain a height of at
least six feet within three years. Furthermore, subdivision and land
development plans shall provide for such screening as follows:
(1) Where nonresidential uses abut residential uses.
(2) Where residential uses abut any railroad right-of-way or arterial
highway.
(3) Along the perimeter of any outdoor storage area, common utility
yard or outdoor equipment area in multiple residential
developments.
(4) Elsewhere, as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission and
the Borough Council.
D. Windbreaks. The use of planting rows to serve as windbreaks to control
the drifting of snow across public and private roadways shall be
required.
A. It is the policy of this Borough that all subdivided lands shall have
immediate access to a public street. Because of unique property
configuration and location, this Borough recognizes the need for limited
exceptions to the foregoing general policy.
B. No subdivision will be approved on a private street or road if more than
two lots already front on such street or road or if, after subdivision,
more than two lots will front on such private street or road.
A. In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the
degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan
has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic
to the site, shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject
to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
§ 292-509 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 292-512
1:377
§ 292-513. Erosion and sediment control.
existing natural features such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded
areas and watercourse.
B. Open space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work,"
which will confine excavation, earthmoving procedures and other
changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure preservation and
prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space.
C. Tree preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within
the proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
D. Topsoil preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills
have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes
of 10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes of 20% or
greater.
E. Landscaping. For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall
be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open
space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and
natural barriers.
F. Buffer planting requirements. Buffer yard requirements should be as
specified in Chapter 330, Zoning.
G. Preserved landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to preserve
the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such
preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable to
required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer screening,
the plan may be approved in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
H. Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not
be permitted without the consent of the Borough. The planting of any
trees within the private property of each residential lot shall be at the
discretion of the landowner and/or developer.
I. Watercourse protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural
drainage.
§ 292-512 SEWICKLEY CODE § 292-513
1:378
A. General purpose.
(1) The Borough Council finds that the minimization of erosion and
control of sedimentation in connection with land development and
subdivision are in the public interest, affecting public health, safety
and welfare, and therefore those regulations governing erosion
control and sedimentation control are necessary for the Borough.
(2) No changes shall be made in the contour of the land; no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other
vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Borough Engineer and/or the
Allegheny County Conservation District, or there has been a
determination by the above entities that such plans are not
necessary.
(3) No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(i) there has been an erosion and sedimentation control plan
approved by the Borough Council that provides for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation, and an improvement bond or other
acceptable securities are deposited with the Borough in the form of
an escrow guarantee which will ensure installation and completion
of the required improvements; or (ii) there has been a
determination by the Borough Council that a plan for minimizing
erosion and sedimentations is not necessary.
(4) Where not specified, measures used to control erosion and reduce
sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the standards and
specification of the Allegheny County Soil and Water Conservation
District, the state Clean Streams Act, and shall comply with
applicable regulations of the Department of Environmental
Protection. The Borough Engineer, or other officials as designated,
shall ensure compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies
of which are available from the Soil and Water Conservation
District.
B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operation to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
§ 292-513 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 292-513
1:379
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
(8) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
C. Grading for erosion and other environmental controls. In order to
provide a suitable site for building and other uses, improve surface
drainage and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
(1) Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition as one of the first items of work done on a
subdivision or development. The wearing surface shall be installed
as approved in the final plan.
(2) Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavation or the sloping surfaces of fills by
installation of temporary or permanent drainage across or above
these areas.
(3) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(4) Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable protection
against erosion during periods of flooding.
(5) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
(6) Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams unless permitted by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
D. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective
responsibility of the applicant and of the contractor, person,
corporation and other entity causing such sedimentation to remove
it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses
and to repair any damage at their expense as quickly as possible.
§ 292-513 SEWICKLEY CODE § 292-513
1:380
§ 292-514. Floodplain area regulations.
(2) Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the
responsibility of the applicant.
(3) It is the responsibility of any applicant and any person, corporation
or other entity doing any act on or across a communal stream,
watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-of-way, to
maintain as nearly as possible in its present state the stream,
watercourse, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during the pendency
of the activity to return it to its original or equal condition after
such activity is completed.
(4) The applicant shall provide and install, at his expense, in
accordance with Borough requirements, all drainage and erosion
control improvements (temporary and permanent) shown on the
erosion and sediment control plan.
E. Compliance with regulations and procedures.
(1) The Borough Council, in its consideration of all preliminary plans of
subdivision and land development, shall condition its approval
upon the execution of erosion and sediment control measures.
(2) The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with standards and
specifications of the Allegheny County Soil Conservation District
and EPA Clean Water Act.
(3) Stream channel construction. Stream channel construction on
watersheds with drainage areas in excess of 1/2 square mile, or in
those cases where downstream hazards exist, will conform to
criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
A. Purpose. The specific purposes of these special provisions are:
(1) To regulate the subdivision or development of land within any
designated floodplain area in order to promote the general health,
welfare and safety of the community.
(2) To require that each subdivision lot in flood-prone areas be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access and that
public facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to
preclude flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(3) To prevent individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flooding by prohibiting the improper subdivision or
development of unprotected lands within the designated floodplain
districts.

1:381
B. Abrogation and greater restrictions. To the extent that this section
imposes greater requirements or more complete disclosure than any
other provisions of this article, in any respect, or to the extent that the
provisions of this section are more restrictive than such other
provisions, it shall control such other provisions of this article.
C. Disclaimer of municipal liability. The grant of a permit or approval of a
plan for any proposed subdivision or land development to be located
within any designated floodplain area shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Borough or by
any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use and shall create no liability upon the Borough, its officials,
employees or agents.
D. Application procedures and requirements.
(1) Preapplication procedures.
(a) Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection concerning soil
suitability when on-site sewage disposal facilities are
proposed.
(b) Prospective developers shall consult with a PADEP Soil and
Waterways Management District representative concerning
erosion and sediment control and the effect of geologic
conditions on the proposed development. At the same time, a
determination should be made as to whether or not any flood
hazards either exist or will be created as a result of the
subdivision or development.
(2) Preliminary plan requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the preliminary plan and shall be prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor:

buildings, structures, roads and public utilities to be
constructed within any designated floodplain area. All such
maps shall show contours at intervals of five feet within the
floodplain area and shall identify accurately the boundaries of
the flood-prone areas.
(c) Submission of the final plan shall also be accompanied by all
required permits and related documentation from the
Department of Environmental Protection and any other
commonwealth agency or local municipality where any
alteration or relocation of a stream or watercourse is proposed.
In addition, documentation shall be submitted indicating that
all affected adjacent municipalities have been notified in
advance of the proposed alteration or relocation. The
Department of Community and Economic Development and the
Federal Insurance Administration shall also be notified in

E. Design standards and improvements in designated floodplain areas.
(1) General.
(a) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in any designated floodplain area may be platted
for development with the provisions that the landowner and/or
developer construct all buildings and structures to preclude
flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
(b) No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will,
individually or collectively, increase the one-hundred-year
flood elevation more than one foot at any point.
(c) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for those uses may be permitted outside the floodway
§ 292-514 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 292-514
1:383
area in a floodplain area if the lowest floor (including
basement) is elevated to the regulatory flood elevation. If fill is
used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend
laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of
the proposed structures.
(d) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for such structures or buildings outside the floodway in a
floodplain area shall be protected. However, the Borough
Council may allow the subdivision or development of areas or
sites for commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below
the regulatory flood elevation if the landowner and/or
developer otherwise protects the regulatory flood elevation
and if the landowner and/or developer otherwise protects the
area to that height or assures that the buildings or structures
will be floodproofed to the regulatory flood elevation.
(e) If the Borough Council determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development
proceed consistent with this determination.
(f) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself
and the Borough Council determines that additional controls
are required to ensure safe development, it may require the
landowner and/or developer to impose appropriate deed
restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be
inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
(2) Drainage facilities.
(a) Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow
of surface water without damage to person or property. The
system shall ensure drainage at all points along streets and
provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-site
waste disposal sites.
(b) Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
The Borough Council may require a primary underground
system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary
surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods.
Drainage plans shall be consistent with local, county and
regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to
prevent the discharge or excess runoff onto adjacent
properties.
F. Streets and driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets and
driveways shall not be more than one foot below regulatory flood
elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and driveways to determine
compliance with this requirement and as required by other provisions
of this article shall be submitted with the final plan.
§ 292-514 SEWICKLEY CODE § 292-514
1:384
G. Sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed up to
the regulatory flood elevation.

There is hereby levied for the tax year 1981 and annually thereafter a tax
for general revenue purposes on the privilege of doing business as herein
defined in the Borough, as follows:
A. Rate and basis of tax.
(1) The rate of the tax on each and every dollar of the whole or gross
volume of business transacted within the territorial limits of the
Borough shall be one mill, one mill shall mean $1 per $1,000 gross
volume of business; except that the rate of the tax on each and
every dollar of the whole or gross volume of business traded by
§ 299-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 299-9
1:399
wholesale dealers or wholesale vendors within the territorial limits
of the Borough shall be 2/3 mill. All nonwholesale business of
such wholesale dealers or wholesale vendors shall be taxed at the
general rate of one mill.
(2) Prior to the effective date of this amendment, the rate of the tax, as
established by Ord. No. 1004, is 1 1/2 mills upon the whole or gross
volume of nonwholesale business and one mill upon the whole or
gross volume of wholesale business. It is the intent of this
amendment that the amount of tax due and payable by every
taxpayer for the tax year 1982 shall be collected as if the rate and
basis of tax as set forth in this amended Subsection A had been in
effect for that portion of the year from January 1, 1982, until the
effective date of this amendment. For that purpose, the Tax
Administrator is hereby authorized to accept returns and payment
of the tax for the year 1982 upon the rate and basis of tax as set
forth in Subsection A and as hereinafter provided in § 299-10 of this
article, as amended. The provisions of this amendment are
expressly condition upon its validity. In the event that all or any
part of this amendment is determined to be invalid for any reason,
the provisions of Subsection A of Ord. No. 1004 shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be deemed to have been repealed.
B. Computation of volume of business.
(1) Every person subject to the payment of the tax hereby imposed who
has commenced his business prior to the full calendar year prior to
the tax year shall compute his annual estimated gross volume of
business upon the actual gross amount of business transacted by
him during said immediately preceding calendar year. For the tax
year 1981 only, such computation shall be based upon the actual
gross amount of business transacted from May 15 through
December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year.
(2) Every person subject to the payment of the tax hereby imposed who
has commenced or who commences his business before the
beginning of the tax year but after the beginning of the full
calendar year prior to the tax year shall compute his estimated
gross volume of business for the tax year upon the gross volume of
business for the tax year upon the gross volume of business
transacted by him during the prior calendar year, taking the
monthly average during said period and multiplying the same by
12. In the event that he shall be in business fewer than 90 days in
the prior calendar year, he shall be permitted to use sufficient days
in the calendar year in which the tax year begins to equal 90
successive days after commencement of business to take a monthly
average thereon and to multiply the average by 12. For the tax year
1981 only, such computation shall be based upon the monthly
average multiplied by 7 1/2.

1:400
(3) Every person subject to the payment of the tax hereby imposed who
has commenced or commences his business subsequent to the
beginning of the tax year shall compute his estimated gross volume
of business for such tax year upon the gross volume of business
transacted by him during the period from the commencement of his
business to the end of the tax year, taking the monthly average
during the first three months of business and multiplying the same
by the number of months from the commencement of business to
the end of the tax year. For the tax year 1981 only, such
computation shall be based on the monthly average multiplied by
7 1/2 for every person subject to the payment of the tax who has
commenced or commences his business subsequent to the
beginning of the tax year but on or prior to May 15, 1981. In the
event that such person shall be in business fewer than 90 days in
the tax year, he shall be permitted to use sufficient days in the next
succeeding calendar year to equal 90 successive days after
commencement of business to take a monthly average thereon, and
to multiply the average by the number of months from the
commencement of his business to the end of the tax year.
(4) Every person subject to the payment of the tax hereby imposed who
engages in a business temporary, seasonal or itinerant by nature
shall compute the estimated gross amount of business to be
transacted by him for the period said person engages in such
temporary, seasonal or itinerant business within the Borough by a
method to be determined by the Tax Administrator.
(5) The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to accept payment
under protest of the amount of business privilege tax claimed by
the Borough in any case where the taxpayer disputes the validity or
amount of the Borough's claim for tax. If it is thereafter judicially
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Borough
has been overpaid, the amount of the overpayment shall be
refunded to the taxpayer. The provisions of this section shall be
applicable to cases in which the facts are similar to those in a case
litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction.

which this tax is applicable shall be credited to this tax and vice
versa.

§ 299-23 SEWICKLEY CODE § 299-26

pay such tax to the Collector, shall be liable for such tax in full, as
though the tax had originally been levied against such employer. No

deduct the tax arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed.

records concerning the employees in the cases described in

calendar year.
(3) The employer shall file with the Collector a copy of each exemption
certificate, including attachments, received by the employer no
later than the end of the first payroll period as to which the
employee claims the exemption set forth at § 299-25C.

calendar year from the tax but either: (a) the employer has received
notification from the person who claimed the exemption or from the
Collector that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of
$12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year; or (b) the
employer has paid to the person earned income within the Borough
in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year,

calendar year and the employer shall withhold from the person, for
the first payroll period after receipt of the notification described in
clause (a) above or for the first payroll period after payments
described in clause (b) above have been made, a lump sum equal to
the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this

person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and
the Collector may pursue collection under this article.

readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with an exemption certificate form at the time of

maintained by the Borough of Sewickley if the gross weight of such
vehicle and load exceeds the limitations set forth in 75 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 4941, unless its owner or operator or a land developer
contracting with its owner or operator has first obtained a permit
from the Borough to do so.
(2) The Borough may issue a permit as provided for in the preceding
subsection upon the following conditions:
(a) Application for a permit shall be made to the Borough Manager
on a form to be provided by the Borough.
(b) In the application, the applicant shall agree to be liable for the
cost of repairing damage to the roadways, structures and
appurtenances within the lines of any street or road or portion
thereof traversed.
(c) The permit may be conditioned as provided in § 4962(a) of the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code.
(d) This subsection and Subsection C(2)(e) immediately below
recognize that frequent overweight trips are more damaging
than isolated overweight trips and, therefore, apply to
applicants who propose to make frequent overweight trips over
Borough streets. "Frequent" shall mean, for purposes of this
section, more than two overweight trips on a particular day. A
person, firm or corporation shall be deemed to propose
frequent trips if the total of proposed overweight trips in one
day by his, her or its officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors exceeds two; in other words, no person, firm or
corporation shall avoid treatment as a frequent overweight
user by having a number of different persons or entities make
two or fewer overweight trips per day. To assist in determining
the liability and responsibility under Subsection C(2)(b) above
of an applicant proposing frequent overweight trips, and prior
to the issuance of a permit or use by applicant of overweight
vehicles on a Borough street, the applicant or his or her
designated representative, together with the Borough
Manager or his or her authorized representative, shall inspect
the street or road or portion thereof to determine the condition
of the base, surface, berms, signs, drainage facilities and other
appurtenances and structures. Said conditions shall be noted
on a form to be provided by the Borough. The applicant,
together with the Borough representative, shall sign and date
said form. One copy shall be given to the applicant. In addition,
the applicant, at his expense, shall have the option of taking
still or moving pictures of the street or road prior to applicant's
use of overweight vehicles on it, provided that such pictures
are taken in the presence of the Borough Manager or
representative and a copy of each picture or film placed in the

custody of the Borough. The applicant shall not be responsible
for any needed repairs noted during the inspection and noted
on the form.
(e) An applicant who proposes to make frequent overweight trips
over Borough streets shall file a bond with the Borough, in a
form and with corporate surety acceptable to the Borough,
conditioned on the repair of damage to the street or road which
appears within two years after the use by the applicant of said
street or road or portions thereof. The amount of the bond shall
be in an amount to be determined by the Borough Manager.
(3) Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this
section dealing with a vehicle's or combination's gross weight shall,
upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75 plus $75
for each 500 pounds or part thereof in excess of 3,000 pounds over
the maximum gross weight. If the gross weight of any vehicle or
combination exceeds the applicable gross weight allowed under 75
Pa.C.S.A. § 4941(a), the fine imposed shall be doubled.
(4) Upon imposition of any fine and costs of prosecution imposed
pursuant hereto, the provisions of §§ 6309 and 6310 of the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code shall apply.
A. On the following bridges and streets or parts of streets, by authority
granted by § 4902(a) of the Vehicle Code, it shall be unlawful for any

§ 318-42. Residential permit parking. [Amended 6-15-1998 by Ord.
No. 1178; 7-20-1998 by Ord. No. 1179; 10-9-1998 by Ord. No. 1182;
11-16-1998 by Ord. No. 1184]
A. Purpose.
(1) Certain public streets in residential areas in the Borough have
become unduly congested with commuter traffic and parking,
which congestion poses a threat to the health, safety and welfare of
the residents of those areas as well as an adverse impact upon the
residential character of those areas so affected.
(2) Such undue congestion is the result of the existence of various
facilities within or in close proximity to residential areas, including
commercial, institutional and public transportation facilities. The
purpose of this section, therefore, is to restrict the flow of
commuter traffic and parking in residential areas that are or may
become adversely affected by such traffic and parking; to reduce
hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the use of streets within
areas zoned for residential uses for the parking of vehicles by

(1) A residential area shall be deemed eligible for consideration as a
residential parking permit area if, based upon surveys and studies
prepared by or under the direction of the Parking Permit Officer or
his designee, it is established that the residential parking area is
impacted by commuter vehicles for extended periods of time during
the day or night, on weekends or during holidays.
§ 318-42 SEWICKLEY CODE § 318-42
1:468
(2) In determining whether a residential area identified as eligible for
residential parking may be designated as residential parking
permit area, Council shall take into account factors which include,
but are not limited to, the following:
(a) The extent of the desire or the need of the residents for
residential parking and their willingness to bear the
administrative cost in connection therewith.
(b) The extent to which the legal on-street parking spaces are
occupied by motor vehicles during the period proposed for
parking restrictions.
(c) The extent to which parking in the area during the period
proposed for parking restrictions consists of commuter
vehicles rather than resident vehicles.
(d) The extent to which motor vehicles registered to persons
residing in the residential area cannot be accommodated by
the number of available off-street parking spaces.
(e) At least 75% of legal parking spaces are utilized during peak
periods, as determined by the parking study.
(f) At least 25% of legal parking spaces are utilized by commuter
vehicles during peak periods.
F. Designation process.

group or groups of residents, containing signatures of at least 70%
of all households in the residential area, or upon the direction of
Council, the Parking Permit Officer shall undertake or cause to be
undertaken a parking study, which shall be deemed necessary to
determine whether a residential area is eligible for residential
permit parking.
(2) After completion of the study, Council shall hold a public hearing on
the subject of the eligibility of the residential area under
consideration for residential permit parking. Such hearing shall be
conducted for the purpose of ascertaining the boundaries of the
proposed residential parking area as well as appropriate time
limitations on parking in the period of the days for its application.
The parking management plan to be considered at these hearings
to solve identified parking problems shall define residential parking
permit program boundaries and other elements of such a program.
G. Council action.
(1) At any time following the completion of the hearing or hearings
conducted with regard to a particular residential area, Council
shall consider, based upon the record of such hearing and the
§ 318-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 318-42
1:469
studies performed, whether to designate the residential area under
consideration as a residential permit parking area.
(2) Council shall examine the evidence as a result of the surveys, study
reports, significant subjects, concerns raised in the public hearing
or hearings conducted; the findings relative to designation
requirements listed in Subsection E deemed applicable to
residential parking areas; and conclusions as to whether the
findings justify preferential parking for that particular area;
proposed boundaries of the residential parking area; and proposed
time limitations in the period of the day for its application.
(3) Council may from time to time review any and all residential
parking permit areas to determine whether such designation shall
continue. Council shall revoke the designation of any residential
parking permit area upon the receipt of a verified petition
containing signatures of at least 70% of all households in the
residential parking area requesting such revocation.

1:470

Permit Officer shall cause appropriate signs to be erected in the
designated area indicating prominently thereon the parking and time
limitations, the period of day for its application and penalties for
violation.
K. Display of parking permits. Permits on motor vehicles shall be displayed
in a manner to be determined by the Parking Permit Officer.
L. Permit parking exemption. A resident motor vehicle on which is
displayed a valid parking permit as provided for in this section shall be
permitted to stand or to be parked in the residential parking permit
area for which the permit has been issued without being limited by time
restrictions established pursuant to this section. Such resident motor
vehicle shall not be exempt from parking restrictions or prohibitions
established pursuant to other authority. All other motor vehicles except
emergency vehicles parked within a residential area shall be subject to
the time restrictions adopted as provided in this section. A residential
parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve the holder thereof a
designated parking space within the designated residential parking
area.

who violates § 318-41, 318-42, 318-44 or 318-45 shall, upon conviction, be

the vehicle involved in the violation; the location where the violation took
place; and any other facts that might be necessary in order to secure a
clear understanding of the circumstances attending the violation. The police

severely disabled veteran registration plate or displaying a
handicapped or severely disabled veteran parking placard, when such
vehicles are being operated by or for the transportation of a
handicapped person or a severely disabled veteran, any person parking
in violation of Subsection A for such space or spaces designated as
being reserved for handicapped persons or severely disabled veterans
shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less
than $50 nor more than $200.
A. Purpose. Parking along the public streets in the C-1 Zoning District has
become unduly congested. Such undue congestion is in part the result
of use of the metered parking spaces in the C-1 Zoning District by the
§ 318-44 SEWICKLEY CODE § 318-45
1:474
employees and/or owners of the businesses located within said district.
The purpose of this section, therefore, is to provide long-term weekday
parking spaces outside of the C-1 Zoning District in a designated
commercial parking permit area for the employees and/or owners of the
businesses in the C-1 Zoning District and to enhance the availability
of parking in the C-1 Zoning District for customers and visitors to the
businesses within the C-1 Zoning District.
B. Commercial parking permit required. No person shall park in the
designated commercial parking permit area without a commercial
parking permit for that area during the restricted periods.
C. Issuance of commercial parking permits. Commercial parking permits
shall be issued by the Commercial Parking Permit Officer, who shall be
the Borough Manager or his designee. No more than one commercial
parking permit shall be issued to any person making application
therefor. Only a certified employee or owner of a business located
within the C-1 Zoning District, who has a motor vehicle registered in his
name or has a motor vehicle for his exclusive use and/or under his
control, may be issued a commercial parking permit. The Commercial
Parking Permit Officer is authorized to issue such rules and regulations
not inconsistent with this section governing the manner in which a
person shall qualify for a commercial parking permit, including, but not
limited to, rules and regulations relating to proof of employment at or
ownership of a business within the C-1 Zoning District and to proof of
ownership or exclusive use or control of a motor vehicle.
D. Designation of commercial parking permit area. By resolution, the
Borough Council may from time to time designate which of the 47
marked parking spaces on both sides of Walnut Street between Henry
Avenue and Bank Street are to constitute the commercial parking
permit area wherein only persons having a commercial parking permit
are permitted to park between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Monday
through Friday.
E. Posting signs indicating restrictions. The Commercial Parking Permit
Officer shall cause appropriate signs to be erected in the designated
commercial parking permit area indicating prominently thereon the
parking, time and day limitations for the commercial parking permit
area.
F. Display of commercial parking permits. Permits in or on motor vehicles
shall be displayed in a manner to be determined by the Commercial
Parking Permit Officer.
G. Commercial parking permit exemption. A motor vehicle on which is
displayed a valid commercial parking permit as provided for in this
section shall be permitted to stand or to be parked in the commercial
parking permit area without being limited by time restrictions
established pursuant to this section. Such motor vehicle shall not be
exempt from parking restrictions or prohibitions established pursuant
§ 318-45 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 318-45
1:475
to other authority. All other motor vehicles except emergency vehicles
parked within a commercial parking permit area shall be subject to
the time restrictions adopted as provided in this section. A commercial
parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve the holder thereof a
designated parking space within the designated commercial parking
permit area.
H. Commercial parking permit term and renewal. Each commercial
parking permit issued by the Commercial Parking Permit Officer upon
payment of the required fees shall be valid on an annual basis from July
1 through June 30. Permits may be renewed annually upon
reapplication and payment of the required fees in the manner required
by the Commercial Parking Permit Officer.
I. Commercial parking permit fees and exception. Council, by resolution,
may adopt a schedule of fees applicable to commercial parking permits.
J. Penalty. Violation of any provision of this section except Subsection K
shall subject the violator to a fine of not more than $25.
K. Violations.
(1) No person shall falsely represent himself as eligible for a
commercial parking permit or furnish false information in an
application to the Commercial Parking Permit Officer.
(2) No person shall use a valid commercial parking permit issued
pursuant hereto or permit the use or display of such permit on a
motor vehicle not registered in the name of, used exclusively by, or
under the control of an employee and/or owner of a business in the
C-1 Zoning District.
(3) No person shall produce, copy or otherwise bring into existence a
facsimile or counterfeit commercial parking permit, and no person
shall use or display a facsimile or counterfeit commercial parking
permit in order to evade time limitations on parking applicable in
the commercial parking permit area.
(4) Violation of any provision of this Subsection K shall subject the
violator to a fine of not more than $600 plus costs and, in default of
payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to
exceed 30 days.

direct access to an existing public right-of-way on the perimeter of
the lot, no internal road shall need to be dedicated to the Borough.
(5) When a lane is proposed, a five-foot-wide landscape easement shall
be required on both sides of the lane. The easement may coincide
with the building setback.
E. No building shall be located closer than 10 feet from the defined rightof-
way line of a lane.
F. Garages.

of-way). The Planning Commission may make recommendations
regarding said minimum and Council shall have the right to modify
the seventy-five-percent ratio based upon specifics of the site.
(2) R-2 District: one street tree per dwelling unit shall be planted
within said area.
(3) C-1, C-2, Inst. and I District: one tree per every 1,000 square feet of
nonresidential square footage shall be planted within said area.
(4) A maintenance agreement regarding said maintenance of trees
within a landscape easement along a lane and access to said
easement shall be prepared and signed by applicable parties.
H. Parking.
(1) Parking requirements shall be calculated based upon the ratios
defined in this chapter. In the case of a fraction of a space, round up
to the nearest whole number.

(1) The applicant shall assign a surface material type as outlined in
Table 4 (below) to all surface materials indicated on the site plan.
This includes both existing surface materials as well as proposed
surface materials.
(2) All surface material assignments shall be denoted on the site plan.
(3) A table itemizing the total square footage of each surface material
(surface area) and the total square footage of the lot (total lot area)
shall be depicted on the site plan.
§ 330-409 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-410
1:541
(4) In a situation where a horizontal surface such as a deck is
suspended or supported above another horizontal surface, in the
calculation the applicant shall account for the surface with the
greatest surface area.
(5) An applicant shall compute the square footage of a roof's surface
area based on the building footprint.
(6) The maximum permitted impervious surface coverage for each
zoning district shall be in accordance with Table 4 (below).
(7) The rate of imperviousness for each surface material denoted on
the site plan shall be based on Table 5 (below). An applicant can
provide an alternative imperviousness rate based on a professional
engineer's statement and computation. The Borough reserves the
right to evaluate the proposed alternative imperviousness rate and
to accept or reject the proposal.
(8) No allowances or deductions shall be made for tree canopy except
as associated to a woodland; see Table 5 (below).
(9) Details shall be provided so compliance may be determined.
(10) The total surface area for all surface material assignments shall be
equal to the total lot area.
(11) In addition to the data indicated on the site plan, the applicant shall
complete the Impervious Surface Coverage Worksheet provided by
the Borough; see Table 6 (below). The worksheet shall be submitted
to the Zoning Officer as part of a preliminary land development
application or a building permit application.

§ 330-503. Natural Resource Protection Overlay.
(1) All land development requirements, code/ordinance regulations,
and zoning reviews shall be satisfied before a building permit shall
be issued for any lot within the Village Overlay.
I. Changes.
(1) After the issuance of a building permit by the Zoning Officer, no
changes of any kind shall be made to the application, permit or any
other plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the Zoning
Officer.
A. Purpose.
(1) The Natural Resource Protection Overlay provides a rational
methodology for:
(a) Inventorying, mapping and evaluating the carrying capacity of
a lot based on the existing natural resources found on said lot;
and
(b) Establishing standards to define and determine the amount of
development that a lot can reasonably support. The net
buildable area, as determined by this antennas process, is the
total acreage and general location(s) of permitted disturbance
on a lot.
(2) The use of the Natural Resource Protection Overlay process is
intended to enable:
(a) Landowners and/or developers to identify early in the
development process the lot's development capacity and,
subsequently, its development opportunities; and
(b) The protection of persons and lots from hazards resulting from
the inappropriate development of land in areas that contain
sensitive existing natural resources.
B. Applicability.
(1) The Natural Resource Protection Overlay is designated on Map 3 of
the Official Zoning Map.101
(2) A resource protection analysis shall:
(a) Be completed and submitted as part of any minor or major land
development and/or any activity requiring excavation as
defined in the Borough. Said information shall be accompanied
by a sealed and signed letter by an engineer and/or landscape

architect licensed within the commonwealth acknowledging
the review and submission of the related site information.
(b) Not be necessary for any area in the antennas where
development requires only a building permit with no
excavation; said development shall be in conformance with the
following:
[1] Steep slopes are those areas sloping more than 15 feet
vertical over a distance of 100 feet horizontal.
[2] All grading shall be minimized.
[3] Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall not exceed 33%
unless the applicant can demonstrate that steeper slopes
can be stabilized and maintained adequately.
[4] A statement, signed and sealed by one or more of the
following registered professionals (in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania): geologist, engineer and/or architect, as
appropriate for the type of work involved in the project,
containing the following items of information:
[a] A written explanation, in narrative form, of the
building methods to be used in overcoming foundation
and other structural problems and preventing soil
erosion and excessive surface water runoff to
neighboring properties and/or streets.
[b] A geotechnical engineering report of the soil types
and underlying geology of the site, as appropriate for
the proposed type of construction.
[c] A plan, a profile and typical cross sections of any
proposed driveway. This material shall have the seal of
a registered professional engineer affixed thereon.
[d] A plan indicating proposed and existing impervious
surfaces, stormwater drainage facilities, drainage
calculations based on a fifty-year storm, retaining
walls, ground cover, and the location of trees and
ornamental shrubs.
[e] Architectural plans, elevations and sections.
[5] A statement signed by the landowner and/or developer
that there is a full understanding of any difficulties
associated with the access stemming from steep slopes,
and that risk of landslides, ground shift or other
instabilities caused by the nature of the geologic,
subsurface and steep slope conditions shall be the
responsibility of the landowner and/or developer.
§ 330-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-503
1:553
[6] A building permit shall not be issued until the landowner
and/or developer or contractor posts financial security in
the form of a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other
type of financial security agreeable to the Borough and the
Borough Solicitor, to be held by the Borough as security
against landslides, rockfalls, water runoff damages, etc.,
that may adversely affect Borough property, streets,
rights-of-way or drainage. Financial security will be posted
in an amount, up to a maximum of $20,000, as determined
by the Borough Engineer or Borough Building Inspector
based on his review of the type and cost of project, location
of the project site, slope of the project site, geological
structure underlying the site, and proximity of the site to
Borough property, streets or right-of-way(s). Financial
security shall be maintained in effect until an occupancy
permit has been issued. Release, discontinuance or
expiration of the posted financial security will be
permitted upon substantial completion of the proposed
construction activities. In addition to any remedies in law
or equity, the Borough may exercise its rights to obtain the
proceeds from the financial security posted by the owner
or contractor to correct or restore damage to Borough
property, streets, rights-of-way(s) or drainage that are not
corrected by the landowner and/or developer or contractor
within 24 hours from occurrence of the damage.
[7] The issuance of any building permit for any construction or
land disturbance within or affecting the Natural Resource
Protection Overlay shall occur only after all of the above
special requirements have been satisfied.
(3) The resource protection analysis shall be completed on the official
Borough forms provided by the Zoning Officer. The official forms
required by this chapter and other applicable analyses defined by
the Borough shall be completed and submitted as part of any
application other than a building permit. No application shall be
processed or accepted unless or until the Zoning Officer
determines that the resource protection analysis has been properly
completed.
(4) This chapter does not imply that areas outside those encumbered
by steep slopes will always be totally free from the adverse effects
of erosion or other effects of nearby steep slopes.
(5) The granting of any permit pursuant to the regulations of this
chapter shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or
warranty of any kind by the Borough, or by any official or employee
thereof, of the practicability or safety of the proposed use and shall
create no liability upon the Borough, its officials or employees.
C. Existing natural resources.
§ 330-503 SEWICKLEY CODE § 330-503
1:554
(1) A natural resource protection analysis shall be conducted to assess
the following natural resources:
(a) Steep slopes;
(b) Floodplains and floodways;
(c) Springs;
(d) Vernal pools;
(e) Wetlands;
(f) Hydric soils;
(g) Natural drainageways;
(h) Lakes/water bodies;
(i) Colluvial soils; and
(j) Red bed soils.
(2) The applicant shall contact the following agencies for information
regarding previous land disturbances of a lot. Additional contact
information is available at the Borough office; however, the
applicant is responsible for contacting or referencing all sources,
listed below or otherwise, to obtain information related to the
assessment of existing natural resources.
(a) Commonwealth of Pennsylvania;

D. Development ratios.
(1) Protection of the Borough's existing natural resources is governed
by the development ratio for each sensitive existing natural
resource. Initial development ratios represent the maximum
amount of disturbance or alteration that a sensitive existing natural
resource can sustain without posing a hazard to persons or a lot.
Development ratios are specific to the existing natural resources
and are further affected by the slope of the natural topography
where a sensitive existing natural resource may be found.
(2) For the purposes of this chapter, slopes used in Table 8: Resource
Protection Worksheet shall be at least 25 feet in length, measured
on a horizontal plane.
§ 330-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-503
1:555
E. Analysis procedures and implementation.
(1) The resource protection analysis is designed to determine the
location and amount of development permitted within any given lot
or contiguous lots under common ownership or control, which shall
be determined in the following manner:

(2) The layout of all proposed buildings, structures, streets and utilities
shall occur only within the portions of a lot that do not contain
sensitive existing natural resources documented as part of this
article as well as determined by the Borough represented by the
individual permitted disturbance ratios and the total net buildable
area (Table 8: Resource Protection Worksheet).
F. Net buildable area increases.
(1) Purpose. To promote the efficient use of land, infrastructure and
economic resources; to provide development flexibility; and to
enhance development quality and longevity, two methods of
increasing the net buildable area of a lot shall be available to a
developer and/or landowner. Net buildable area increases shall be
granted in return for development enhancements. The two
methods include the following:
(a) Stormwater runoff reduction measures; and
(b) Green roof construction.
(2) Applicability.
(a) Net buildable area increases shall be permitted only in areas
located on slopes between 0% and 25% in gradient. Net
buildable area increases shall utilize the existing natural
resources in reverse order of sensitivity in accordance with
Table 8 of this chapter, whereas least sensitive resource areas
shall be utilized first.
§ 330-503 SEWICKLEY CODE § 330-503
1:558
(b) A landowner and/or developer may incorporate one or more of
the methods outlined in Subsection F(3) below to a land
development plan.
(c) When multiple methods are combined as prescribed in
§ 330-503F(3), the combined total net buildable area increase
shall not exceed 25% of the lot's "total net buildable area" as
calculated in Line 8 of the Resource Protection Worksheet.
(d) Net buildable area increases shall occur on the same lot where
the development enhancement(s) are provided.
(e) Prior to receiving Borough Council approval of a green-roofrelated
buildable area increase, the landowner and/or
developer shall complete a preliminary and/or final slope
stability investigation report in conformance with Borough
standards.
(3) Methods.
(a) Stormwater runoff reduction measures. Upon incorporating
any two of the following stormwater runoff reduction measures
into a proposed land development, a landowner and/or
developer shall receive a maximum ten-percent net buildable
area increase. No preliminary or final slope stability
investigation report shall be required to obtain the ten-percent
net buildable area increase.
[1] Provide area(s) for groundwater recharge through on-site
stormwater infiltration for an amount of impervious area
equal to one times the net buildable area increase. The
minimum required recharge volume shall be equal to 1.5
inches of runoff for the area defined.
[2] Preserve existing trees whose combined canopy area is
equal to one times the net buildable area increase. A
preserved tree shall be a minimum of eight inches in
diameter at breast height (dbh).
[3] Install additional landscaping area(s) equal to 1.5 times
the net buildable area increase. This additional
landscaping may be used to treat any cut or fill slopes; to
increase the habitat value of any on-site stormwater
management facility; to reestablish streamside buffers or
for other on-site uses. Lawn or turf areas shall not
constitute additional landscaping. Habitat value and
related landscaping shall be defined as Pennsylvania
native species.
[4] Utilize porous pavement to reduce stormwater runoff.
Porous paving, with proof by engineering calculation/soils
analysis, may be used if the landowner and/or developer
§ 330-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-503
1:559
can demonstrate that this method will produce zero
increased stormwater runoff. The Borough Engineer shall
review proposed design and engineering of the pavement
to verify construction is in accordance with acceptable
industry standards and United States Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) "Porous Pavements Phase I -
Design and Operational Criteria."
[5] Propose on-site environmental mitigation of equal or
greater environmental value. Mitigation shall include but
may not be limited to the removal of landfilled hazardous
materials, the remediation and treatment of abandoned
mine drainage, or the establishment of quality wetlands.
When such mitigation measures are proposed, the
Borough Engineer shall review the proposed mitigation
measures and shall make a recommendation on the
relative value of the proposed mitigation to the Planning
Commission and the Borough Council.
(b) Green roof construction.
[1] A landowner and/or developer that utilizes green roof
construction in a building design may receive a buildable
area increase equal to a maximum of 40% of the total
surface area of the green roof.
[2] Green roof construction shall be in accordance to the
standards defined by the United States Green Building
Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) Program.
[3] Green roofs may be incorporated into either the principal
or accessory building or structure of the lot.
G. Cluster lot development.
(1) Cluster lot development shall be permitted only within the
boundaries of the Natural Resource Protection Overlay.
(a) No portion of any cluster lot development shall be outside the
boundary of the Natural Resource Protection Overlay.
(b) If a lot is situated in such a manner that only a portion of that
lot is within the Natural Resource Protection Overlay only that
portion located within the antennas may utilize cluster lot
development as described in this chapter.
(c) In no case may a lot contain more units than is prescribed by
the base zoning district's maximum density regulations.
(2) Cluster lot development is voluntary and not required. However, if
a landowner and/or developer does not wish to utilize the cluster
development regulations, the net density for a land development
§ 330-503 SEWICKLEY CODE § 330-503
1:560
contained within the boundaries of the Natural Resource
Protection Overlay shall be calculated by multiplying the buildable
area, as defined by the Natural Resource Protection Worksheet,
by the permitted gross density stated within the applicable zoning
district where the lot is located. Minimum lot size permitted in the
applicable zoning district may be reduced a maximum of 25%.
(3) Culs-de-sac shall be permitted to access cluster developments
within the Natural Resource Protection Overlay boundaries.
Roadways ending in a cul-de-sac shall be a minimum of 250 feet but
no longer than 500 feet in length.
(4) The balance of the land not utilized for residential lots shall be
reserved as common open space. Ownership of the common open
space shall be determined and approved by Borough Council prior
to final application approval.

shall comply with the standards below prior to the Borough issuing
approval and operation commencing on the lot. Compliance shall be
determined by the Zoning Officer with respect to permitted uses, by the
Zoning Hearing Board with respect to special exceptions, and by the

shall be utilized for measuring such noise at any and all lot lines of the
subject lot on which the noise source is located. Proof of such current
compliance shall be presented to the Borough upon the request of the

the peace ordinance enforced by the police. In addition, it shall not have
any influence on complaints among neighbors regarding HVAC equipment
or gas generators.

Except temporary vibration resulting from construction activity, vibrations
detectable without instruments on any adjacent lot in any zoning district
shall be prohibited.
§ 330-1106. Odors.

Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 330-1201. Nonconformities.
General.
§ 330-1202. Nonconforming lots of record.
A. Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, there exist uses
and lots of land that were lawful before this chapter's adoption but
which are now prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of
this chapter. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. Such uses are considered incompatible with
the permitted uses in the zoning districts involved.
B. A nonconforming structure may be modified, expanded and/or
enlarged, so long as:
(1) The modification, expansion and/or enlargement is for a legal use;
(2) The modification, expansion and/or enlargement is not for a
nonconforming use;
(3) The modification, expansion and/or enlargement does not increase
the existing nonconformity(ies) associated with the lot.
C. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout a building that was
designed and arranged specifically for the nonconforming use, but the
nonconforming use shall not be permitted to occupy land outside the
building. If the use of any such nonconforming structure or lot ceases
for any reason for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, any
subsequent use of the structure or lot shall conform to the regulations
specified by this chapter for the zoning district involved.
A. In any zoning district in which single-family residential buildings are
permitted, a single-family residential building and associated accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record existing on the date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter. Such a lot must be in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails
to meet the zoning district's requirements for area or width, or both,
provided that the lot conforms to the zoning district's setback
dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or
both. Variance of area, width and setback requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this article, and if all or part of the lots do not
meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this
§ 330-1201 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-1202
1:637
article, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel
for the purposes of this article, and no portion of the parcel shall be
used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements
established by this article, nor shall any division of the parcel be
made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this article.

hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning Hearing Board may by rule
prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary
§ 330-1304 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-1305
1:643
application to the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant
a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
C. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this act and the Zoning Ordinance.
D. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
(1) A written application for the variance is submitted.
(2) The required fees are paid.
(3) Public notice by advertising shall be given at least two weeks in
advance of the hearing. The owner of the property for which the
variance is sought or his agent shall be notified by mail.
(4) The hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or by
agent or by attorney.
(5) The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the
requirements of this section have been met by the applicant for the
variance.
§ 330-1305 SEWICKLEY CODE § 330-1305
1:644
(6) The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the
variance and that the variance is the minimum variance that will
make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
(7) The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
E. In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and such safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and subject to § 330-1702, Enforcement
remedies.
F. Under no circumstances shall the Zoning Hearing Board grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter
in the district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited
by the terms of this chapter in said district.
