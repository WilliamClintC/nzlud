Article I. Nonemergency Response Charges
[Adopted 5-14-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-09]
§ 7-1. Policy; purpose.
The Board of Supervisors of Uwchlan Township finds that the continuing use of the personnel and
equipment of the Uwchlan Ambulance Corps and other ambulance services for nonemergency
purposes consumes excessive levels of ambulance service which deprives others requiring emergency
services from receiving prompt responses from said services, thereby potentially endangering the life
and safety of individuals served by emergency ambulance services in the Township. Every location
that consumes emergency ambulance service in nonemergency situations places an unfairly
disproportionate burden for the funding of the ambulance services on taxpayers of Uwchlan Township
and other funding sources of the ambulance services. The following provisions and the fee imposed
hereby are authorized in order to provide revenue to help defray the costs of ambulance services
covered by the fees. The fee imposed hereby is not a penalty or fine.
§ 7-2. Imposition of response fee.
There is hereby imposed a response fee upon every unit of real property within the service territory of
the Uwchlan Ambulance Corps for the consumption of ambulances and ambulance services in
nonemergency circumstances.

identity of the unit of real property and the time of the response to the Chief of the Corps. The

Article III. Licensing and Regulation of Businesses
[Adopted 9-14-1998 by Ord. No. 98-17]
§ 77-9. Purpose and findings.
Purpose.
Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township Code to prohibit nuisances;
to promote the health, cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of Uwchlan Township;
and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township of Uwchlan enacts this article to
minimize and control the adverse effects of adult entertainment business uses (also referred
to hereinafter occasionally as adult entertainment businesses) and thereby protect the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve
the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of blight.
The Board of Supervisors has determined that locational criteria alone can not adequately
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the Township and that licensing
is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do

not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
The Board of Supervisors does not intend this article to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment but to enact a content-neutral article which addresses the
secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses.
Findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds and it adopts by reference the adverse secondary effects of
adult entertainment businesses presented in hearings and in reports and adopted as part of
Township Ordinance No. 98-14, enacted September 14, 1998.[1]
Editor's Note: Ordinance No. 98-14 is included in the Township Zoning Ordinance.
The finding noted in Subsection B(1) above raises substantial governmental concerns as do
the following legislative findings:
Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be
reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of
that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult entertainment
businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent
incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner
consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as
the citizens of the Township. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the
licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business, fully in possession
and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
Requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep information regarding
current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain
types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto-
day operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business, where such
information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the
operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a
limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the
conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
The fact that an applicant for a license to operate an adult entertainment business has
been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this article.
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years
serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the Township will be promoted by
the enactment of this article.

of the right to bring or file any action, claim or complaint whatsoever against any police officer or
emergency personnel who makes a forced entry in response to such an alarm into the premises
on which such an alarm is installed, as result of entry into the subject premises. In the event the
owner of such premises is a person other than the permit applicant, as in the instance of a lessee
or other user not the owner of the premises on which the alarm is installed, such permit application
shall constitute an indemnification agreement by the applicant to hold harmless any such police

direct that the user submit a report to the Chief of Police within five days of receipt of the
notice describing actions taken or to be taken to determine and eliminate the cause of the
false alarms.
If the alarm user submits a report as directed, the Chief of Police shall determine if the action
taken or to be taken will substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms; he shall notify the
alarm user in writing that his permit will not be revoked at this time and that if one more false
alarm occurs within the month, the user's permit may be revoked.
If no report is submitted, or if the Chief of Police determines that the action taken or to be
taken will not substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms, the Chief of Police shall give
notice to the user that the permit will be revoked without further notice.
§ 82-14. Violations and penalties.
[Amended 3-24-1997 by Ord. No. 97-5[1]]

within the allotted time period(s) shall, upon conviction in a summary proceeding brought before a
Magisterial District Judge under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be guilty of a

D.
The Township of Uwchlan finds that the development of broadband systems has the potential of having
a great benefit to and positive impact on the people of Uwchlan. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technologies associated with cable television, the Township also finds that public
convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested
in the Township or such persons as the Township so designates. Further, the Township recognizes that
broadband systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
Township residents but also a variety of broadband, interactive services to Township agencies and
other institutions. For these purposes, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set
forth in this chapter:
Cable services and telecommunications services should be available to as many Township
residents as possible.
A broadband system authorized to provide cable service should be capable of accommodating
both the present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the community.
A broadband system should be constructed and maintained during the franchise term so that new
components may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities.
A broadband system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community. The
Township intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public
interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter
be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof.

and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the Township

amendment shall be applied retroactively to materially impair preexisting contractual agreements
entered into between the Township and a franchisee.
§ 94-5. Franchise required.

The term of a franchise shall not exceed 15 years and may not exceed five years unless the
franchise agreement contains clear and enforceable provisions for regulating upgrades, improving
any customer service requirements, reevaluating the provision of additional access channels,
reevaluating interconnection of the system with other cable systems, and making such other
requirements as may be necessary in light of advancements in technology at minimum intervals of
not greater than every five years.
A franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other
franchises to operate broadband systems within the Township or affect the Township's right to
authorize use of Township streets by other persons to operate broadband systems or for other
purposes as it determines appropriate.
Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the Township and a franchisee,
such franchise agreement shall constitute a contract between the franchisee and the Township,

all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee
and the Township relating to the franchise.
All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the
streets, and the Township reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities
are to be placed within the streets.
A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the original franchisee. No
transfer of a franchise shall occur without the prior consent of the Township and unless application
is made by the franchisee and Township approval obtained pursuant to this chapter and the
franchise agreement.
A franchise holder may not enter into or enforce any exclusive contract with a subscriber
(including a building owner) as a condition of providing or continuing service.

Township laws. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power
of the Township, including all rights the Township may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552.
No course of dealing between a franchisee and the Township, nor any delay on the part of the
Township in exercising any rights hereunder, shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the
Township or acquiescence in the actions of the franchisee in contravention of rights except to the
extent expressly waived by the Township or expressly provided for in a franchise agreement, or
except as provided in 47 U.S.C. § 546(d).
The Township shall have the maximum plenary authority to regulate broadband systems,
franchisees, and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible; except where rights
are expressly waived by a franchise agreement they are reserved, whether expressly enumerated
or not.
§ 94-8. Interpretation of franchise terms.
The express terms of this chapter will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a
franchise agreement unless such franchise agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a
requirement of this chapter.
The provisions of a franchise agreement will be liberally construed in favor of the Township in
order to effectuate the purposes and objectives of this chapter and the franchise agreement and to

After the effective date of this chapter, any person who occupies Township streets or public rights-ofway
for the purpose of operating or constructing a broadband system and who does not hold a valid
franchise from the Township shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to
its provisions regarding construction and technical standards and franchise fees. In its discretion, the
Township at any time may require such person to enter into a franchise agreement within 30 days of
receipt of a written notice by the Township that a franchise agreement is required; and/or require such
person to remove its property and restore the area to a condition satisfactory to the Township within
such time period; and/or remove the property itself and restore the area to a satisfactory condition and
charge the person the costs therefor. In no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by
action of the Township and subject to a franchise agreement.
§ 94-10. Right of condemnation reserved.
Nothing in this chapter or the franchise shall limit any right the Township may have to acquire by
eminent domain or otherwise any property of a franchisee.
Article IV. Applications for Grant, Renewal or Modification

receipt of a request for an RFP from an applicant seeking a franchise to provide cable service
and/or telecommunications service, the Township shall commence a proceeding to identify the
relevant future needs and interests of the community and, upon completion of that proceeding,
shall promptly issue an RFP and proposed franchise agreement, which shall be mailed to the

forth in § 94-12C. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the RFP shall be
followed by each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The Township Manager, or his/her
designee, shall be authorized to seek additional information from any applicant and to establish
deadlines for the submission of that information.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 94-12A, a person may apply for an initial franchise by
submitting an unsolicited proposal and requesting an evaluation of that proposal pursuant to § 94-
12D.
An RFP for the grant of an initial franchise shall require, and an unsolicited proposal shall contain,
at minimum, the following information:
Name and address of the applicant and identification of the ownership and control of the
applicant, including; the names and addresses of the 10 largest holders of an ownership
interest in the applicant and affiliates of the applicant, and all persons with five-percent or
more ownership interest in the applicant and its affiliates; the persons who control the
applicant and its affiliates; all officers and directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and any
other business affiliation and broadband system ownership interest of each named person.
A demonstration of the applicant's technical ability to construct and/or operate the proposed
broadband system, including identification of key personnel.
A demonstration of the applicant's legal qualifications to construct and/or operate the
proposed broadband system, including but not limited to a demonstration that the applicant
meets the following criteria:
The applicant must not have submitted an application for an initial or renewal franchise to
the Township, which was denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a
broadband system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as
to which any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved adversely to
the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application.
The applicant must not have had any franchise validly revoked by any franchising
authority within three years preceding the submission of the application.
The applicant must have the necessary authority under Pennsylvania law to provide
cable service and/or telecommunications service, as appropriate.
A franchise will not be issued to an applicant that may not hold the franchise as a matter
of law. An applicant must have, or show that it is qualified to obtain, the necessary federal
licenses or waivers required to operate the broadband system proposed.
The Township may, in its sole discretion, refuse to issue a franchise if, at any time during
the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, applicant was convicted of any
act or omission of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal
truthfully with the Township and the subscribers of the broadband system, or to
substantially comply with its lawful obligations under applicable law, including obligations
under consumer protection laws and laws prohibiting anticompetitive acts, fraud,
racketeering, or other similar conduct.
An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in
response to an RFP issued by the Township, or intentionally withholds information that
the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected official of the Township holds a
controlling interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Township shall provide an opportunity to an applicant

to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under Subsection C(3)(b) or
(e), by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken
by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom, the lack of involvement of the
applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of broadband
systems.
A statement prepared by a certified public accountant regarding the applicant's financial
ability to complete the construction and operation of the broadband system proposed.
A description of the applicant's prior experience in broadband system ownership,
construction, and operation, and, if cable service is proposed, identification of communities in
which the applicant or any of its principals have, or have had, a cable television franchise or
license or any interest therein.

service will reasonably meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community,
including descriptions of how the proposal will meet the needs described in any recent
community needs assessment conducted by or for the Township, and how the proposal will
provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or
financial support to meet the community's needs and interests.
Pro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term, including a statement of
projected income, and a schedule of planned capital additions, with all significant
assumptions explained in notes or supporting schedules.
If an applicant proposes to provide cable service to an area already served by an existing
cable service franchisee, the identification of the area where the overbuild would occur, the
potential subscriber density in the area that would encompass the overbuild, and the ability of
the streets to accommodate an additional broadband system.
Any other information as may be reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
Information that the Township may request of the applicant that is relevant to the Township's
consideration of the application.
An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer certifying the truth and
accuracy of the information in the application, acknowledging the enforceability of application
commitments, and certifying that the proposal meets all federal and state law requirements.
In evaluating an application for an initial franchise seeking authority to provide cable service
and/or telecommunications service, the Township shall consider, among other things, the following
factors:

The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the
material terms of any existing franchise for the Township.
Whether the quality of the applicant's service under an existing franchise in Uwchlan,
including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has
been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served.
Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable
service.
Whether the applicant's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and
interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
Whether, to the extent not considered as part of Subsection D(4), the applicant will provide
adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or
financial support.
Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate
and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property which would be used by the
broadband system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned
would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, the
public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the broadband system
to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative
superiority or inferiority of competing proposals.
Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or controls any other broadband
system in the Township, or whether grant of the application may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service or telecommunications service in the Township.
If the Township finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set
forth above, it shall issue a franchise, subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise
agreement. If the Township denies a franchise, it shall issue a written decision explaining why the
franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether to issue or not to issue a franchise, the Township
may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from
the public on an applicant's proposal may be received. The Township also may grant or deny a
request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may
reject any application which is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP.
If the Township grants a franchise subject to the applicant's entry into a franchise agreement, the
Township and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within 30 calendar
days from the date of the Township resolution granting the franchise. This period may be extended
for good cause by the Township. If agreement is not reached with the Township within 30 calendar
days from the date of the Township resolution granting the franchise, or if the period is not
extended by the Township, the franchise will be null and void without further action by the
Township. The Township shall approve or disapprove the proposed agreement by resolution or
may direct that it be subject to further negotiation.
§ 94-13. Application for grant of a renewal franchise.
Renewal franchise authorizing the provision of cable service shall be conducted in a manner consistent
with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. If neither the franchisee nor the Township activates
or can activate the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(c) (including, for example, if the
provisions are repealed), the provisions of § 94-12 shall apply, and a renewal request shall be treated
the same as a request for an initial franchise. The following additional requirements shall apply to all
applicants seeking renewal after the effective date of this chapter where the procedures set forth in 47
U.S.C. § 546(a)-(c) are activated:

Within six months after receipt of notice from a franchisee that has invoked the renewal
procedures of Section 626 of the Cable Act, the Township shall undertake a proceeding, including
notice to, and opportunity for participation by, the public, for the purpose of: identifying future
cable-related community needs and interests, including the costs of meeting such needs and
interests, and reviewing compliance by the franchisee with the then-current franchise. Such
proceeding shall be completed within 12 months from the date begun. The Township shall submit
a copy of its findings, if any, in writing to the franchisee within said twelve-month period.
Upon the expiration of the twelve-month period set forth in Subsection A above, the franchisee
may submit to the Township a proposal for renewal.
Upon receipt of the renewal application, the Township shall publish a notice of its receipt once in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Township and make copies available for review by the
public.
Within four months of the date it receives the proposal for renewal, and based on the standards
set forth in § 94-12D of this chapter, the Township will either pass a resolution agreeing to renew
the franchise, subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the Township and
the franchisee, or pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should
not be renewed, provided that, if the Township and a franchisee cannot reach a franchise
agreement within four months after the proposal is received, then the resolution agreeing to
renewal shall be deemed a resolution preliminary assessing that the franchise should not be
renewed.
If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the
franchisee the Township will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c), to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D).
If renewal of a franchise is denied, the Township may acquire ownership of the broadband system
or effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another person upon approval of the Board. Any
such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the broadband
system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself.
If renewal of a franchise is denied and the Township does not purchase the broadband system or
approve or effect a transfer of the broadband system to another person, the Township may require
the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If
the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the Township may have the
removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.
To the extent that any of the substantive provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with Section
626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, they shall not apply.
§ 94-14. Application for modification of a franchise.
An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following
information:
The specific modification requested;
The justification for the requested modification, including the impact of the requested modification
on subscribers and others, and the financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved
or disapproved, demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of financial pro formas;
A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section 625 of the Cable Act, 47
U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the requested modification meets the standards set
forth in 47 U.S.C. § 545;

An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer certifying the truth and accuracy of
the information in the application, and certifying that the application is consistent with all federal
and state law requirements.
§ 94-15. Filing fees.

effective date of this chapter shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount as set from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 94-16. Public hearings.
An applicant shall be notified of any public hearing held in connection with the evaluation of its
proposal and shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
Article V. Cable System Design
§ 94-17. System requirements.
Unless a review of future cable-related needs and interests (whether conducted prior to issuance of an
RFP or in evaluating an unsolicited proposal) shows that different standards should apply, every cable
system must at least satisfy the following requirements.
§ 94-18. Minimum capacity.
Any cable system constructed, upgraded, or reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter at a
minimum shall be designed to meet or exceed the capacity standards of the cable system with the
greatest capacity then in operation within the County of Chester. The franchisee shall comply with all
FCC standards and requirements pertaining to converters and cable-ready televisions as may be
amended from time to time.
§ 94-19. Description of system.
The franchisee shall provide the Township a full description of the system proposed for construction
and shall, upon completion of any system modification or upgrade, submit to the Township as-built
maps for the entire system, as modified or upgraded, to the extent such maps have not previously
been provided to the Township.
§ 94-20. Interconnection.
The franchisee and the Township shall evaluate at intervals no greater than once every five years
from the date of the franchise agreement the feasibility of interconnecting the cable system with
other cable systems.

When feasible, the franchisee shall, at the request of the Township, interconnect with other cable
systems.
Nothing herein shall require franchisee to interconnect with another cable system without the
permission of such cable system. All costs of any interconnection required by this section are
external costs which may be passed through directly to basic subscribers. To the extent Township
approval is required for any such basic rate adjustment, franchisee shall be under no obligation to
perform such interconnection until such approval is granted.
§ 94-21. Provision of service.
Unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement, after cable service has been established by
activating trunk distribution cable for an area specified in a franchise agreement, the franchisee shall
provide cable service to any household requesting cable service within that area, including each
multiple-dwelling unit in that area, except for multiple-dwelling units to which it cannot obtain access. At
a minimum, franchisee shall provide cable service within the Township whenever there is a minimum of
35 homes per linear mile into which the system can be extended. This construction will be completed
as soon as possible, but, in any case, within six months of attainment of said density for aboveground
facilities and within 12 months for underground facilities. Franchisee may apply to the Township for an
extension of the time limit, not to exceed an additional six-month period, provided that the franchisee
used due diligence in attempting timely completion and any delay was caused by circumstances
beyond the franchisee's control, in which case Township's agreement to said extension shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For new residential subdivisions, a franchisee shall install cable system
facilities in the public right-of-way to be dedicated to the Township concurrent with the installation of
other utilities in the public right-of-way.
§ 94-22. Technical standards.
Any cable system within the Township shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47
CFR § 76.601 and any other applicable technical standards, including any such standards as
hereafter may be amended or adopted by the Township.
A franchisee shall not design, install, or operate its facilities in a manner that will interfere with the
signals of any broadcast station, the facilities of any public utility, the cable system of another
franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast
signals.
At the times specified in the franchise agreement or as required by FCC rules, the franchise shall
perform at its expense proof of performance tests, and such other tests as may be specified in the
franchise agreement, designed to demonstrate compliance with this section, the franchise
agreement, and FCC requirements. The franchisee shall, upon the request of the Township, make
such test results available to the Township for inspection and copying at the franchisee's offices.
The Township shall have the right to inspect the cable system facilities during and after their
construction to ensure compliance with this section, the franchise agreement, and applicable
provisions of local, state and federal law, and may require the franchisee to perform additional
tests based upon its prior investigation of system performance or upon subscriber complaints.
Article VI. Minimum Facilities and Services
§ 94-23. Emergency Alert System.
A franchisee shall install and thereafter maintain an Emergency Alert System ("EAS"). This EAS shall
be designed and operated to meet or exceed all FCC standards and requirements as may be

§ 94-24. Access channels.
The franchisee shall reserve for the nonexclusive use by the Township and the Downingtown Area
School District, without charge, a minimum of one six-megahertz downstream channel for public,
educational, and governmental use, to subscribers delivering a signal the technical quality of
which is equivalent to the technical quality of other channels on the broadband system. The
franchisee shall provide all modulators, demodulators, laser transmitters/receivers and other
devices as may be required to permit use of the downstream capacity.
The franchisee and the Township shall evaluate at minimum intervals of no greater than once
every five years the need for the provision of additional access channels for use by the Township
and the Downingtown Area School District without charge. Each reevaluation shall consider, but
shall not be limited to, the reservation by the franchisee of the amount of capacity required to
transmit one six-megahertz channel upstream, for public, educational and governmental use, the
provision by the franchisee of all modulators, demodulators, laser transmitters/receivers, and other
devices as may be required to permit use of the upstream capacity, and such modifications as
may be required to use video compression technology and add such equipment in connection with
all or part of the upstream and downstream channel capacity for public, educational, and
governmental use. When additional access channels are deemed necessary by the Township after
an evaluation, the franchisee shall reserve the same for public, educational, and/or governmental
use.
§ 94-25. Studio and equipment.
The franchisee and the Township shall evaluate at minimum intervals of no greater than once every
five years the need for the provision of one public access facility located within the Township or at such
location designated by the Township, which facility shall include an adequate studio, editing suites,
control room, playback area, administrative and training space, tape, set, and equipment storage
space, and all property shall be secured, ventilated, air conditioned, heated, lighted, wired, and
accessible to the handicapped. It shall also provide equipment to fully equip the facility, including the
studio, separate portable equipment suitable for community use, automated playback equipment, and
control facilities, so that signals can be received on the upstream channels or originated from the
facility, and then routed from the facility to the broadband system headend and onto appropriate
channels on the broadband system. When the provision of the public access facility is deemed
necessary by the Township after an evaluation, the franchisee shall provide the same in accordance
with this section.
§ 94-26. Remote line telecasting.
The franchisee and the Township shall evaluate at minimum intervals of no greater than once
every five years the need for the provision of upstream channel capacity for live telecasts from
such public buildings as may be specified in the franchise agreement. When the provision of
upstream capacity is deemed necessary by the Township after evaluation, the franchisee shall
provide such capacity.
Upon the provision of remote live telecasting, the franchisee shall make available all devices
necessary to accomplish upstream telecasts through such public facilities.
§ 94-27. Recovery of external costs.

The Township acknowledges that a franchisee is entitled to pass through to basic subscribers the
increased costs incurred in providing any of the foregoing facilities and services which may be required
by the Township in the future. To the extent Township approval is required for any such basic rate
adjustment, franchisee shall be under no obligation to provide such facilities or services until such
approval is granted.
Article VII. Construction Provisions
§ 94-28. System construction schedule.
The franchisee shall specify the construction schedule.
§ 94-29. Construction standards.
The construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of the broadband system shall be in
accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as
amended; the National Electrical Safety Code; the National Electric Code; FCC; the Standards of
Good Engineering Practices for Measurement of Cable Television Systems of the National Cable
Television Association; other applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations that may apply
to the operation, construction, maintenance, or repair of a broadband system, including, without
limitation, local zoning and construction codes, and laws and accepted industry practices, all as
hereafter may be amended or adopted.
All installation of electronic equipment shall be of a permanent nature, using durable components.
Without limiting the foregoing, antennas and their supporting structures (towers) shall be painted,
lighted, erected, and maintained in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the
Federal Aviation Administration; Uwchlan Township Ordinance No. 88-7[1] and all other applicable
state or local laws, codes, and regulations; all as hereafter may be amended or adopted.
Editor's Note: See now Ch. 265, the Township Zoning Ordinance.
Without limiting the foregoing, all the franchisee's plant and equipment, including, but not limited
to, the antenna sites, headend and distribution system, towers, house connections, structures,
poles, wires, cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, fixtures, and apparatuses shall be installed,
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained, and
operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by experienced maintenance
and construction personnel so as not to endanger or interfere with improvements the Township
shall deem appropriate to make or to interfere in any manner with the rights-of-way or legal rights
of any property owner or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
A franchisee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly
accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage, injury, or nuisance to the public.
Any and all streets, public property, or private property which are disturbed or damaged during the
construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, or construction of the
broadband system shall be promptly repaired by the franchisee at its expense, and in strict
compliance with all applicable Township standards.
A franchisee shall, at its expense and by a time specified by the Township, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the Township by
reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or widening,
change of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks,
or any other type of municipal, public utility improvements, street vacation, or for any other

purpose where the convenience of the Township would be served thereby; provided, however, that
the franchisee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place.
If any removal, re-laying, or relocation is required to accommodate the construction, operation, or
repair of the facilities of another person that is authorized to use the public streets, a franchisee
shall, after 30 days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested
by the responsible entity. The Township may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs
associated with the removal, re-laying, or relocation of facilities among those authorized to install
facilities in the public streets if the parties are unable to do so themselves.
In the event of an emergency, or where a broadband system creates or is contributing to an
imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the Township may remove, re-lay, or relocate that
broadband system subject to such prior notice to the franchisee as may be reasonable under the
circumstances giving rise to the emergency or danger involved.
A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the
Township, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of
such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting
same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in
the case where the requesting person is the Township, in which case no such payment shall be
required. The franchisee shall be given not less than 10 days' advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang a street or public right-of-way of
the Township so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires
and cables of the franchisee, provided that the franchisee provides reasonable prior notice to the
Township and complies with Township requirements. The Township shall have the right to
supervise such trimming.
A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing underground conduits or overhead
utility facilities whenever feasible and may not erect poles in public rights-of-way without the
express permission of the Township. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a franchisee
shall erect its facilities on existing power and telephone poles pursuant to pole attachment
agreements to be entered into between franchisee and the utility companies having ownership of
or otherwise having jurisdiction over such existing power and telephone poles. Copies of
agreements for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the Township as required by
the franchise agreement or upon Township request. No new poles shall be set by franchisee
except where no poles exist or use of an existing utility pole is not practicable due to excessive
rearrangements or other conditions.
On streets where electrical and telephone utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of
initial construction of a cable system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be
located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and a subscriber's residence,
a franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are
located underground. If either electric or telephone utility wiring is aerial, a franchisee may install
aerial cable except where a property owner or resident requests underground installation and
agrees to bear the additional cost of such installation over and above the cost of aerial installation.
All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment, and structures shall be installed
and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners,
and shall be constructed and maintained by a franchisee so as not to interfere with television and
radio reception by inhabitants not using the services of the franchisee. The Township may issue
such rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a broadband system
installed in, on, or over the streets, as may be consistent with this chapter and the franchise
agreement. The Township shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles
owned by the franchisee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the
broadband system operations of the franchisee.

continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such broadband system or property has been
installed in any street without complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise

days after written notice by the Township, shall commence removal from the streets of all such
property as the Township may require.

may be reasonably necessary and appropriate to the performance of any of the rights, functions or
duties of the Township in connection with this chapter or the franchise.

A record of all complaints received and interruptions or degradation of service experienced for
the preceding twelve-month period prior to a performance review.
A full and complete set of plans, records, and as-built maps showing the approximate location

amended from time to time.
The Township may impose reasonable requests for additional information, records, and
documents from time to time.

Special evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise at the
request of the Township.
All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced in a newspaper of general

five consecutive days preceding each session.
Topics that may be discussed at any scheduled or special evaluation session may include, but not
be limited to, system performance and construction, franchisee compliance with this chapter and

extensions.
During the review and evaluation by the Township, the franchisee shall fully cooperate with the
Township and shall provide such information and documents as the Township may need to
reasonably perform its review.
§ 94-35. Proprietary information.
If this Article VIII or any request for information by the Township under this chapter requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the information. However, at
the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, the franchisee may request that

disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as
proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted

if the Township determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is
consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. If the Township
decides that information can be withheld, it will issue a written decision explaining the basis for
withholding the information, and place that decision in a public file for inspection. If the franchisee
requests confidentiality and the request is denied, the franchisee may seek review within five
working days of the denial in any appropriate forum.
Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the
Township. The Township shall weight the policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the
reason cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly
notify the requesting entity and the franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition
of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee
may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal in any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be
stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
Article IX. Consumer Protection Provisions
§ 94-36. Customer service requirements.
Every franchise agreement shall require a franchisee to comply with all applicable federal, state, and
local customer service requirements and shall specify the minimum customer service requirements the
franchisee must satisfy. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, every franchisee must satisfy the following
requirements whether or not specified in its franchise agreement.
A franchisee shall maintain a business office at a location where subscribers may readily visit and
may call without incurring toll charges that shall be open at least during normal business hours,
which shall include evening hours and some weekend hours.
A franchisee shall render sufficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for
good cause and for the shortest time possible. A franchisee shall generally respond to all service
calls within 24 hours and correct cable malfunctions as promptly as possible and shall maintain a
competent staff sufficient to provide adequate and prompt service to its subscribers. A franchisee
shall provide a pro rata credit to subscribers for periods of interruption of service in accordance
with applicable law.
A franchisee shall maintain adequate telephone lines and personnel to respond to subscriber
complaints or inquiries and schedule service calls in a timely manner. A franchisee shall respond
to written subscriber complaints in writing within five business days, with a copy to the Township. A
franchisee shall also respond to Township complaints in writing within five business days.

Subscribers shall have the right to have cable service disconnected. A refund of unused service
charges shall be paid to the customer within 30 days from the date of termination of service.
§ 94-40. Parental control option.
A franchisee shall provide parental control devices to all subscribers who wish to be able to cut off any
objectionable channel or channels of programming from the cable service entering the subscriber's
home.
§ 94-41. Township Manager.
The Township Manager shall be responsible as the Township official for receiving and acting upon any
unresolved complaints. Written notice of this complaint procedure, including the identity of the
Township official responsible for receiving unresolved complaints, shall be given to each subscriber at
the time of initial subscription to the cable system.
Article X. Rate Regulation
§ 94-42. Rate charge and rate schedule.
Each franchisee shall state in its proposal to enter into an agreement for the award of a franchise
hereunder its initial monthly rates, installation charges, and all other charges, including but not
limited to equipment fees, late fees, and other administrative charges, if any.
A franchisee shall give subscribers at least 30 days' notice of its intention to change monthly rates,
equipment charges, and installation charges by mailing notices thereof to each of the current
subscribers to whom such charges will apply. The franchisee shall give the Township Manager or
his designee 45 days' advance notice of any rate change.
The franchisee shall not, as to rates, charges, services, or facilities, make or grant any undue
privilege or advantage to any party, nor subject any party to undue prejudice or disadvantage,
provided that the franchisee may establish reasonable classifications of customers. Nothing in this
chapter prohibits the reduction or waiver of charges in connection with temporary promotional
campaigns or providing a senior citizen discount, provided the same waivers are provided to all
similarly situated customers.
§ 94-43. Local regulatory framework.
The Township is a certificated franchising authority under the Cable Act, and empowered by the
FCC to regulate rates for basic tier service and customer service and equipment. The Township
shall regulate all rates and charges except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by law, and
no rate or charge may be imposed without the prior approval of the Township except such rates
and charges that the Township is prohibited from regulating. Subject to the foregoing, any change
made without prior approval is an illegal change, and a franchisee is prohibited from requesting or
requiring a subscriber to pay an illegal rate as a condition of providing service.
All rates must be reasonable. The Township may adopt such regulations, procedures, and
standards as it deems necessary to implement rate regulation and may regulate rates by
amendment to this chapter, by a separate resolution or ordinance, by amendment to a franchise
agreement, or in any other lawful manner.

Article XI. Franchise Fee
§ 94-44. Finding.
The Township finds that the streets and public rights-of-way of the county, state, and Township to be
used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable television system are valuable public property
acquired and maintained by the county, state, and Township at great expense to the taxpayers. The
Township further finds that the grant of a franchise to use streets and public rights-of-way is a valuable
property right without which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital.
§ 94-45. Payment to Township.
The Township shall be paid a franchise fee in an amount no less than the greater of 5% of its
gross annual revenues, or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Every franchise
agreement shall specify the percentage the franchise is initially required to pay as a percentage of
gross revenues, but if the maximum amount permitted increases, franchisee shall, simultaneously
with the effective date of any change in any law or, if later, the effective date of any regulation
required to implement the law, increase the franchise fee to the maximum allowed by that law.
The franchise fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that the franchisee may be
required to pay under any federal, state, or local law and to any other tax, fee, or assessment
imposed by utilities and cable operators for use of their services, facilities or equipment.
Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax.
No acceptance of any payment by the Township shall be construed as a release or an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the Township may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the franchisee.
In the event any franchise fee payment or recomputation amount is not made on or before the
date specified herein, the franchisee shall pay additional compensation and interest charges
computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the
Township's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed.
The franchise fee and any other costs assessed by the Township against a franchisee shall be
paid quarterly to the Township and shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise,
unless otherwise agreed in the franchise agreement. The Township shall be furnished at the time
of each payment with a statement verified by the franchisee's general manager reflecting the total
amount of semi-annual gross revenues for the payment period. Quarterly payments shall be made
to the Township no later than 45 days of March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 31.
Quarterly computation dates are the last days of the months of March, June, September and
December. An annual statement of gross revenues shall be furnished to the Township by an
independent, certified public accountant approved by the Township. A franchisee shall provide an
annual complete audit statement for each calendar year within 90 days from the end of that
calendar year.
The Township shall have the right to inspect and copy, subject to the provisions regarding
proprietary information in § 94-35 of this chapter, the franchisee's records and the right to audit
and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for a period of three
years from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of the Township unless the audit
discloses an underpayment in excess of 3%, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by
the franchisee as a cost incidental to the enforcement of the franchise. Any additional amounts
due to the Township as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to
the franchisee by the Township of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit

report, unless written notice of disagreement is filed by the franchisee with the Township within
such time period. In the case of a dispute, the issue shall be resolved through binding arbitration in
accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
The franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records in such a manner as to enable the
Board to determine the cost of assets of the franchisee which are used in providing cable services
within the Township.
Article XII. Insurance; Surety; Indemnification
§ 94-46. Insurance required.
A franchisee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of a franchise specifically agrees that it will
maintain, throughout the entire length of the franchise period, at least the following liability insurance
coverage insuring the Township and the franchisee: worker's compensation and employer liability
insurance to meet all requirements of Pennsylvania law and comprehensive general liability insurance
with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of the broadband system, and the conduct

Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; and in a form approved by the Township Manager.
§ 94-48. Policies available for review.
All insurance policies shall be available for review by the Township, and a franchisee shall keep on file
with the Township certificates of insurance.
§ 94-49. Additional insureds; prior notice of policy cancellation.
All insurance policies shall name the Township, its officers, boards, supervisors, agents, and
employees as additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in
coverage shall not be effective unless 30 days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the
Township. A franchisee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of proof that
the franchisee has obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the Township which complies with this
chapter.
§ 94-50. Indemnification.
A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the Township,
its officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims,
suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the
construction, maintenance, or operation of its broadband system, the conduct of franchisee's business
in the Township, or in any way arising out of the franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise
granted hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or

prohibited by this chapter or a franchise agreement. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the
Township's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or
proceeding; and claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure
consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or franchisees of programs to be delivered by the
broadband system.
§ 94-51. Indemnification for Cable Act claims.
A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
Township, and in its capacity as such, the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from and against
any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to Section
638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of the installation,
construction, operation, or maintenance of its system, including but not limited to any claim against the
franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the
violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark, or patent, or of any
other right of any person, firm, or corporation. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Township from
participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel at its own cost and expense.
§ 94-52. No limit of liability.
Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the Township shall be construed
to limit the liability of the franchisee for damages under any franchise issued hereunder.
Article XIII. Enforcement Remedies
§ 94-53. Available remedies.
In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the Township may apply any one or a
combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise
agreement, or applicable state or federal law:
Revoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in this chapter.
In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the Township may seek legal or equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 94-54. Fines.
[Amended 3-24-1997 by Ord. No. 97-5[1]]
In addition to any other remedy available under this chapter, any person who violates or permits the
violation of any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $600,
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Township. Each twenty-fourhour
period that a violation of this chapter continues shall constitute a separate offense. All fines and
penalties collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the Township Treasury. If the
penalty imposed for the violation of this chapter is not voluntarily paid to the Township, the Township
shall initiate a civil enforcement proceeding before a Magisterial District Judge. Upon a finding of
liability for committing said violation, or permitting said violation, in such civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, the defendant shall pay the fine, together with additional daily penalties
for continuing violations, plus costs and attorneys' fees. No judgment shall be imposed until the date of
determination of a violation by a Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable Rules of

[1] Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 94-55. Determination of appropriate remedies.
In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the Township shall take into consideration
the nature of the violation, the person or persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the
remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the Township
determines are appropriate to the public interest.
Article XIV. Transfers
§ 94-56. Township approval required.
No transfer shall occur without prior approval of the Township.
§ 94-57. Application.
An application for a transfer shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including
details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential
impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the information required in § 94-
12C of this chapter shall be provided with respect to the proposed transferee. Within 30 days of
receiving an application for transfer, the Township shall notify the franchisee of the information it
requires to make the determination in § 94-58 of this chapter and shall take action on that application
within 120 days after receiving the requested information.
§ 94-58. Determination by Township.
In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for
a transfer of a franchise, the Township shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of
the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its
franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such
noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the Township, or
whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable
service in the Township; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would
adversely affect subscribers, the Township's interest under this chapter, the franchise agreement, or
other applicable law, or make it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost. The Township reserves the right to review the
purchase price of any transfer or assignment of a cable system. Any negotiated sale value which the
Township deems unreasonable will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for
rate increases, if permitted by applicable law.
§ 94-59. Transferee's agreement.
No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that
it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement and that it will assume
the obligations and liabilities known and unknown of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the
franchise agreement.
§ 94-60. Approval does not constitute waiver.

https://ecode360.com/print/UW2708?guid=UW2708&children=true 82/620
A.
B.
Approval by the Township of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of
the rights of the Township under this chapter or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or
after the date of the transfer.
§ 94-61. Processing fee.
As a condition of considering a transfer, the Township may impose a fee upon the transferee to cover
its estimated out-of-pocket expenses in considering the application for transfer of a franchise. Any
amount collected in excess of the estimated amount shall be returned to the transferee.
Article XV. Revocation or Termination of Franchise
§ 94-62. Basis for revocation.
A franchise may be revoked by the Township for a franchisee's failure to construct, operate, or
maintain the broadband system as required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, for defrauding
or attempting to defraud the Township or subscribers, if the franchisee is declared bankrupt, or for any
other material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise agreement. To invoke the
provisions of this article, the Township shall give the franchisee written notice of the default in its
performance. If within 60 calendar days following such written notice from the Township the franchisee
has not taken corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued to
the satisfaction of the Township, the Township may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to
revoke the franchise, stating its reasons, provided that no opportunity to cure shall be provided where
the franchisee has defrauded or attempted to defraud the Township or its subscribers, or in the event
the franchisee is declared bankrupt. In the case of a fraud or attempted fraud, the franchise may be
revoked after the hearing required under § 94-63; revocation for bankruptcy shall be governed by § 94-
64.
§ 94-63. Procedure.
Prior to revoking a franchise, the Township shall hold a public hearing, upon 30 calendar days' notice,
at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the
public hearing, the Township may determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the information
presented at the hearing, and other information of record. If the Township determines to revoke a
franchise, it shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such
decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee.
§ 94-64. Revocation after bankruptcy.
Any franchise may, at the option of the Township following a public hearing before the Township, be
revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding,
unless within that one-hundred-twenty-day period:

In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a

as may be established or as are required pursuant to Article XIV.

§ 119-4. Amplification systems allowed.
Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio coverage shall be equipped
with either a radiating cable system or an internal multiple antenna system with or without FCC-type
accepted bidirectional eight-hundred-megahertz amplifiers, as needed. If any part of the installed
system or systems contains an electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of
operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without
external power input. If used, bidirectional amplifiers shall include filters to reduce adjacent frequency
interference at 35 dB below the NPSPAC band. Settings used should not attenuate the NPSPAC
frequencies, and further provided that they are not more than one megahertz from the NSPAC
frequencies.
§ 119-5. Testing procedures.
Acceptance test procedure.
When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion of installation, it will be the
building owner's responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way
coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90%. Each floor of the building shall be
divided into a grid of approximately 20 equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will
be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more
statistically accurate, the floor may be divided into 40 equal areas. In such event, a maximum
of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the 40 area tests, if the system
continues to fail, the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the ninety-percent
coverage requirement. The test shall be conducted using the most current E. F. Johnson
portable radio, or current manufacturer of communications equipment used by CCDES, or its
equivalent, available to the Uwchlan Township Police and/or Fire Department, talking through
the CCDES as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A spot located approximately in
the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify twoway
communications to and from the outside of the building through the CCDES. Once the
spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area will not be permitted.
The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be
kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year
during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results became lost, the building
owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.
Annual tests. When an in-building radio system is required, the building owner shall test all active
components of the system, including, but not limited to, amplifiers, power supplies and backup
batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is
the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies
shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during
an actual power outage. If within the one-hour test period, in the opinion of the testing technician,
the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods
until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery. All other active components shall
be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the
intended purposes.
Five-year tests. In addition to the annual test, the building owner shall perform a radio coverage
test a minimum of once every five years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the
requirements of the original acceptance test. The procedure set forth above shall apply to such
tests. A copy of accepted tests shall be provided to the Chester County Emergency Services
Engineering Department.

Qualifications of testing personnel. All tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by a
person in possession of a current FCC technical license or a current technician certification issued
by the APCO, NABER, or the PCIA. All test records shall be retained on the inspected premises
by the building owner and a copy submitted to officials of the fire companies serving Uwchlan
Township and the Uwchlan Township Police Department.

Police and fire personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his representative, shall
have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field testing to be certain that the required level of
radio coverage is present.
§ 119-7. Exemptions.
This chapter shall not apply to structures in Use Groups R-3 and R-4 of the International Building

§ 126-5. Establishment of transportation service area.
A single transportation service area is hereby established as shown on the Transportation Service
Area Map included as Figure Number 1 in the Roadway Sufficiency Analysis.
§ 126-6. Applicability of impact fee.
[Amended 3-27-1995 by Ord. No. 95-06]
Except as provided in § 126-11 hereof, this article shall be uniformly applicable to all development
which occurs within the designated transportation service area.
§ 126-7. Imposition of impact fee.
No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for a development in the designated
transportation service area as herein defined unless the applicant therefore has paid the impact
fee imposed by and calculated pursuant to this article.
At the discretion of the Board of Supervisors of Uwchlan Township, the Township may accept
payment of the impact fee by way of a contribution of real property to be used for public purposes
or a contribution of improvements to public property. The value of such a contribution shall be
equivalent to the total amount of the impact fee imposed upon all new development and changes
of use as required by § 126-8 hereof. The value shall be determined by obtaining a fair market
value appraisal of the real property and/or improvements to be contributed or by other generally
accepted valuation methodology.

§ 126-8. Calculation and establishment of impact fee.

The impact fee imposed by this article is hereby imposed upon all new development and change
of use and shall be determined as of the date of preliminary land development or subdivision

by the estimated number of trips to be generated by the new development in accordance with the
Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Fifth Edition 1991,
and any amendments and all future additions thereof ("ITE Manual"). Alternatively, the impact fee
may be calculated pursuant to a special transportation study pursuant to § 126-9 of this article. In
the event there is a change of use, the impact fees will be recalculated and reassessed.
§ 126-9. Special situations.
In the event that the trip generation characteristics of a new development are not sufficiently
documented in the ITE Manual, the applicable impact fee shall be determined by the Township staff
following review of a special transportation study submitted by the developer. Such study shall
document projected p.m. peak volumes at the subject site based on completion and occupancy of the
proposed development.

of the Township Manager in accordance with Act 209 and, specifically, Section 505-A thereof, 53

and evaluate the implementation of the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan as adopted by
the Board of Supervisors and report at least annually on the assessment of impact fees. In
addition, the Advisory Committee shall make recommendations to the Township on the need to
update or revise the adopted Land Use Assumptions, Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
or impact fees at the request of the Board of Supervisors.
§ 126-11. Credits and exemptions.
[Added 3-27-1995 by Ord. No. 95-06]
Credits. The Board of Supervisors, within its discretion, may grant a credit of up to 100% of the
applicable impact fees for growth and development which is proposed and undertaken by a
developer who is a municipality, public school district, public authority or other governmental entity,
and such development is for a governmental purpose and in the public interest. In order to claim
the credit provided by this Subsection A, the developer must make a request for the credit upon
application for preliminary subdivision or land development approval or a building, zoning,
conditional use or occupancy permit if no subdivision or land development approval is required.

B. Action upon receipt of certificate.
Upon receipt of a certificate pursuant to Subsection A(1) of this section, the insurance
company, association or exchange shall pay the claim of the named insured in accordance
with the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company,
association or exchange equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
policies covering the building or other structure. In the case of such a loss, the insurance
company, association or exchange, the insured property owner and the Township shall follow
the procedures set forth in §§ 132-3 and 132-4 of this chapter.
Upon the receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to Subsection A(2) of this section, the
insurance company, association or exchange shall return the bill to the Treasurer and transfer
to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance proceeds necessary to pay the taxes,
assessments, penalties, charges and costs shown on the bill. In the case of a loss subject to
§§ 132-3 and 132-4 of this chapter, the insurance company, association or exchange shall
transfer to the Treasurer the amount from the insurance proceeds shown on the bill by
separate draft from the amounts transferred under § 132-3 of the chapter. The Township shall
receive the amount and apply or credit it to payment of the items shown in the bill.
§ 132-3. Establishment of municipal fire insurance escrow.
When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company, association or exchange
equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
other structure, the insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds to the Township Treasurer the amounts required by and in accordance with the procedures
set forth in 40 P.S. § 638(c). Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to the Township shall be
disbursed in accordance with the policy terms. The named insured may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after the transfer,
and the Township Treasurer shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named
insured if the Township has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
The Township Treasurer shall carry out the duties of this section.
§ 132-4. Disposition of escrow proceeds.
Upon receipt of the proceeds by the Township as authorized by § 132-3, the Township Treasurer shall
place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the total cost of removing,
repairing or securing incurred by the Township. When transferring the funds as required in § 132-3, an
insurance company, association or exchange shall provide the Township with the name and address of
the named insured, whereupon the Township shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds
have been received by the municipality and notify the named insured that the procedures under this
section shall be followed. The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure have been completed and the required proof received by the
Township Treasurer if the Township has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the
Township has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the
costs shall be paid from the fund, and if excess funds remain, the Township shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the ability of
the Township to recover any deficiency. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
the Township and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds
to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.

§ 166-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Uwchlan Township Noise Control Ordinance."
§ 166-2. Purpose.
[Amended 6-13-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-02]
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that public health, safety and welfare shall not be abridged by
the making and creating of noise pollution or of public nuisances from disturbing, excessive or
offensive noises in the Township. The Board of Supervisors of the Township recognizes that
uncontrolled noise represents a danger to the health and/or welfare of the Township's residents and
businesses and that each person in the community is entitled to live and work in an environment in
which the level of impulsive and amplified noise is minimized for the community good. It is the purpose
and scope of this chapter to provide regulations to prevent excessive noise and excessive vibration
and to limit, control and eliminate excessive noise and excessive vibration in general from whatever
source; control sound levels that vehicles, appliances and equipment shall be allowed to produce, and
also to provide for the prohibition of other kinds of offensive noises. These regulations and provisions
are intended to protect the physical, mental and social well-being of persons living, working and visiting
in Uwchlan Township.
§ 166-3. Legislative findings.
[Amended 6-13-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-02]
The Board of Supervisors finds that failure of individuals, businesses, industries, persons maintaining
animals, social gatherings and other activities to regulate the noise emanating from their premises
constitutes a violation of the peace and enjoyment of the residents, employees and other occupants of
the Township and a public nuisance. The Board of Supervisors further finds that no one has the right to
create excessive noise or excessive vibration that intrudes into or onto the property of others.
Specifically, such noise emanating from homes, occupations, businesses, industries, soundamplification
equipment, radios, electronic sound recording equipment, vehicles, persons maintaining
animals, social gatherings, and other activities:
Creates a nuisance in that residents are deprived of the enjoyment of their homes, disturbed in
their sleep, and otherwise prevented from the quiet enjoyment of their residential premises;
Is harmful and detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the Township's inhabitants;
Affects the property values of real estate in the Township;
Affects the public welfare by reflecting negatively on the quality of life in residential areas of the
Township;
Interferes with the conduct and operation of business and industry;
Disturbs the peace and good order of the Township; and

written request with the Township Manager, with such information that the Manager may
reasonably require. In determining whether to grant or deny the request, the Manager shall
balance the hardship to the applicant, the community and other persons of not granting the
variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of the persons affected, the
adverse impact on the property affected, and any other adverse impact.
If the Township Manager determines that the requested variance will not cause an adverse impact
on the health, safety or welfare of the community, a permit may be issued specifying the noise
permitted, the hours and days authorized and the duration of the permit. In granting the permit, the
Township Manager may attach such other reasonable conditions and safeguards as he may deem
necessary to carry out the legislative findings and intent and purposes of this chapter. The permit
shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant.
Noncompliance with any of the conditions of the permit shall terminate it without further notice to
the applicant; the noise activity shall immediately cease, and the applicant shall be subject to all of
the provisions of this chapter.

or judicial proceedings, fines and penalties as provided in this chapter. In addition to any other relief

Meter rates. Except for those customer classifications enumerated in § 200-4 hereof, the quarterly

meter for any such combination, the Township may estimate the amount of water used by each
individual establishment if necessary.

§ 200-6. Measuring volume for the purpose of § 200-5.
Methods of measuring volume.
Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the water company discharges sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, the volume of water used, as
determined from meter readings of the water company, shall be used in computing the sewer
rentals.
In cases where a person has a source of water supply in addition to or other than from the
water company and discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer
system, such person shall permit the Township to install a meter on such additional or other
source of supply. The total amount of water consumed as shown by these meter readings will
be used in computing the sewer rentals.
In cases where a person uses water from the water company and/or from an independent
supply such that all or any part of the water so used is not discharged into the sewer system,
the quantity of water used to determine the sewer rentals shall be computed by one of the
following methods as determined by the Township:
Method No. 1. By placing a meter or measuring device on the sewer connection. The
readings from this meter or measuring device shall be used in computing the sewer
rentals.
Method No. 2. By placing a meter or measuring device on the effluent not discharging
into the sewer system. The reading from this meter or measuring device will then be

deducted from the total water meter readings and the remainder will be used in
computing the sewer rentals.
Method No. 3. When it is not practical to install measuring devices to determine
continuously the quantity of water not discharged into the sewer system, the Township
will determine, in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the percentage
of metered water discharged into the sewer system, and the quantity of water used to
compute the sewer rental shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be
submitted to the Board of Supervisors of the Township, after notice of the estimate,
whose decision on the matter shall be final.
Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices required to be used under the provisions of
this article [except those provided by the water company or those provided by the Township under
§ 200-6A(2) above] shall be furnished and installed by the Township at the expense of the
property owner. All such meters or measuring devices (except those provided by the water
company) shall be under the control of the Township, and may be tested, inspected or repaired by
Township employees whenever the Township shall deem necessary. The owner of the property
upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and
safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made by the Township at the property owner's
expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes.
Bills for such installation and repairs shall be due and payable at the same time and collected in
the same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such bills from and after their due date shall
constitute a lien upon the property upon which such measuring device is installed.
Meter readings. The Township shall be responsible for the reading of all meters or measuring
devices (except to the extent the water company's readings are used), and they shall be made

Meter rates for industrial, commercial and institutional users in the Eagleview service area.
[Amended 1-12-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-02; 1-3-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-01; 12-12-2011 by Ord. No.
2011-05; 1-6-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-01; 12-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-06[2]]
Meter rates. Except for those customer classifications enumerated in § 200-23B of this article,
the quarterly sewer rents or charges shall be based on the quantity of water used as
evidenced by the meter readings of water meters installed by the water company and such
other meters or measuring devices as may be installed pursuant to any provisions of this
article, and shall be at the rate of $6.43 per thousand gallons of water used.
Minimum rates. Regardless of water consumption, the minimum charge for sanitary sewage
from industrial, commercial and institutional establishments shall not be less than $95 for
each such establishment for each three-month period.
Multiple use. In each case of a combination of one or more commercial, industrial or
institutional establishments in one property, all having the use of the sewerage system
through one sewer connection, then each such establishment shall be charged the abovementioned
minimum rate as though each were separately connected to the sewerage system,
and if there is only one water meter for any such combination, the Township may estimate the
amount of water used by each individual establishment if necessary.
Schools. Schools (public or other daily schools) shall be charged based upon the quantity of
water used by them, at the rates and in the manner provided by § 200-23C(1) of this article
for industrial, institutional and commercial establishments, except that, notwithstanding
Subsection C(2) of this section, the charge for each school for each quarterly billing period
ending September 30 will be subject to a minimum charge equal to the average of the three
bills issued for such school next preceding the period ending September 30 in each year.
Surcharge. In addition to the meter rates set forth in Subsection C, any person whose
wastewater characteristics for BOD , TSS, ammonia-nitrogen or phosphorous exceed the
typical concentrations in excess of those expected for typical domestic dischargers, as stated
in § 200-24C of this article, whether authorized by an agreement with the Township or
otherwise, shall be required to pay to the Township a surcharge, as detailed in § 200-24C of
this article.

Methods of measuring volume.
Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the water company discharges
sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewerage system, the volume of water
used, as determined from meter readings of the water company, shall be used in
computing the sewer rentals.
In cases where a person has a source of water supply in addition to or other than from
the water company and discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the
sewerage system, such person shall permit the Township to install a meter on such
additional or other source of supply. The total amount of water consumed shown by these
meter readings will used in computing the sewer rentals.
In cases where a person uses water from the water company and/or from an
independent supply such that all or any part of the water so used is not discharged into
the sewerage system, the quantity of water used to determine the sewer rentals shall be
computed by one of the following methods as determined by the Township:
By placing a meter or measuring device on the sewer connection, the readings from
this meter or measuring device shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.
By placing a meter or measuring device on the effluent not discharging into the
sewerage system, the reading from this meter or measuring device will then be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the remainder will be used in
computing the sewer rentals.
When it is not practical to install measuring devices to determine continuously the
quantity of water not discharged into the sewerage system, the Township will
determine, in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the percentage
of metered water discharged into the sewerage system, and the quantity of water
used to compute the sewer rental shall be the percentage so determined of the
quantity measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the estimated
amount shall be submitted to the Board of Supervisors of the Township, after notice
of the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final.
Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices required to be used under the provisions
of this article [except those provided by the water company or those provided by the Township
under § 200-23D(1)(b) above] shall be furnished and installed by the Township at the
expense of the property owner. All such meters or measuring devices (except those provided
by the water company) shall be under the control of the Township, and may be tested,
inspected or repaired by Township employees whenever the Township shall deem necessary.
The owner of the property upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible
for its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made by the Township at
the property owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear
and tear or other causes. Bills for such installation and repairs shall be due and payable at the
same time and collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such bills
from and after their due date shall constitute a lien upon the property upon which such
measuring device is installed.
Meter readings. The Township shall be responsible for the reading of all meters or measuring
devices (except to the extent the water company's readings are used), and they shall be
made available to Township employees for meter reading at any reasonable time.
Changes in classification, additional classifications and modifications. If use or classification of any
property should change within any quarterly period, the difference in the sewer rental, prorated on
a monthly basis to the nearest calendar month, will be charged or credited, as the case may be,
on the bill for the succeeding quarterly period. Additional classifications and additional sewer
rentals may be established by the Township from time to time.

Time and methods of payments. Sewer rentals or charges shall be paid quarterly, and billings for
sewer rentals shall be made by bills dated, and on, the first days of January, April, July and
October of each year, for the three-month period immediately preceding the date of the bill. The
bills for sewer rentals under § 200-23B and C for the quarterly period during which a property is
first connected to the sewerage system will be prorated on the basis of the applicable rate. All bills
shall be due and payable on their respective dates.
Penalties for delinquent sewer rentals and liens.
Penalties, interest, costs, and attorney's fees for delinquent accounts.
[Amended 4-12-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-04]
All sewer charges not paid in full by the due date shall be deemed to be delinquent. A
penalty of 10% of the amount of the quarterly sewer charge shall be added to the
quarterly charge if not paid by the due date.
The amount of the quarterly sewer charge and penalty shall bear interest form the due
date at the rate of 10% per annum until paid.
Collection procedures shall be commerced for all accounts delinquent over six months or
exceeding $500. The Township shall charge an administrative fee as set by resolution of
the Board of Supervisors for starting collection procedures, which shall be added as
costs to the amount of the delinquent account.
[Amended 10-22-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-04]
The Township may terminate sewer service to any property where the payment of sewer
charges has not been paid by the due date. Sewer service shall not be restored until all
delinquent charges, penalties, costs, interest, attorney's fees, and the cost of shutting off
and restoring service have been paid in full.
The penalties, interest, costs and charges set forth above shall be in addition to all other
legal and equitable remedies available to the Township to collect delinquent accounts,
including but not limited to municipal lien and assumpsit remedies. The amounts of the
penalties, interest, costs and charges set forth above may be changed from time to time
by resolution of the Township Board of Supervisors.
All sewer rentals not paid by the due date, and all penalties, interest, costs, charges and
attorney's fees thereon, shall be a lien against the delinquent property and shall be filed
as a lien in the office of the Prothonotary of Chester County and shall be collected in the
manner provided by law for filing and collection of such liens. The Township shall charge
a lien fee as set by resolution of the Board of Supervisors when the account is referred to
the Township Solicitor for collection, which shall be added as costs to the delinquent
account.[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
I).
The delinquent account holder shall also be responsible for all legal fees incurred by the
Township in collecting the account in accordance with a schedule enacted from time to
time by Township ordinance.
All liens for delinquent accounts filed as of the effective date of this article shall be
amended to include interest at the statutory rate of 10% per annum beginning on the date
of the delinquency until paid.
All persons connected to the sewerage system shall give the Township their correct address.
Failure to receive bills will not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor permit an
extension of the period during which bills are payable at face.[4]

Spills or slug loads.
All industrial users shall provide and maintain at their own expense facilities adequate to
prevent an accidental discharge or slug load of any substance stored or used at the industrial
user's facilities that, if discharged into the sewerage system, will violate any of the provisions
of § 200-24A or 200-25B of this article. Detailed facility plans and operating procedures to
provide this protection (accidental discharge prevention facility plans and procedures) shall be
submitted to the Township before construction of said facility. The plan shall contain, at a
minimum, a description of discharge practices, including nonroutine discharges; description of
stored chemicals; procedures both to notify the EWTP immediately of accidental discharges
and slug loads and procedures to prevent adverse impacts from such discharges and
procedures to prevent such discharges. All existing industrial users shall provide accidental
and slug load discharge prevention facility plans and procedures, or demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Township that they are not needed, within 180 days of the adoption of this
article. Industrial users proposing to connect to the sewerage system after the effective date
of this article shall submit accidental and slug load discharge prevention facility plans and
procedures to the Township for approval, or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township
they are not needed, before connection to the sewerage system. Review of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the
industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article.
In the case of an accidental discharge or slug load to the sewerage system of any pollutant,
the industrial user shall immediately notify, by telephone, the Township of the incident. The
notification shall include information regarding the location of the discharge, the kind of
pollutants involved, the concentration and volume of the discharge and corrective actions
planned or taken.
Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug load, the industrial user shall submit
to the Township a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the
measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the industrial users of any liability on account thereof.
A notice shall be permanently posted by each industrial user on a bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge or
slug load. Employers shall inform all employees who may cause or suffer such an accidental
discharge to occur, of the emergency notification procedure.
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. If the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards,
located in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, for any industrial user are more
stringent than limitations imposed under this article for industrial users in that subcategory, then
the pretreatment standards shall apply and are hereby incorporated in this article. The Township
shall notify all affected industrial users of the applicable (reporting) requirements under 40 CFR
403.12. If an industrial user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not
previously submitted an application for an industrial waste discharge permit, the industrial user
shall apply for a permit within 90 days of promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard.
Dilution prohibition. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement, no industrial user shall increase the use of process water,
or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The Township may
impose mass limitations on industrial users in cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
State requirements. State requirements and limitations on industrial wastewater discharges shall
apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those

Industrial waste discharge permits.
General.
No significant industrial users shall connect to or discharge wastewater to the sewerage
system without an industrial waste discharge permit.
Industrial users which are not significant industrial users do not require an industrial
waste discharge permit and may discharge industrial wastewater to the sewerage
system, but are required to comply with all other provisions of this article. If an industrial
user makes changes to processes, flow, wastewater concentration, wastewater
characteristics, or other changes which result in the industrial user meeting the definition
of significant industrial user, the industrial user shall immediately upon becoming aware
such a change has occurred, or 90 days prior to such a change if it is planned, notify the
Township and obtain an industrial waste discharge permit within 90 days of submission of
the permit application.
Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, has not previously submitted an application for an industrial
waste discharge permit, the user shall, within 90 days after the promulgation of the
application National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, (1) obtain an industrial waste
discharge permit; and (2) provide the baseline monitoring information required by 40 CFR
403.12(b). This information shall be incorporated into the application for an industrial
waste discharge permit.
Permit application.
Significant industrial users shall file with the Township a completed industrial waste
discharge permit application.
The application for an industrial waste discharge permit shall be fully completed and
verified in writing by the industrial user, or a duly authorized and knowledgeable officer,
agent or representative thereof. The application shall contain in units and terms
appropriate for evaluation, such scientific or testing data, or other information, as may be
required by the Township, and the applicant shall pay an application fee and shall
reimburse the Township for all expenses incurred as a result of the processing of the
signed application. The Township shall have, at its discretion, the right to inspect the
premises, equipment and material, and laboratory testing facilities of the applicant.
Notwithstanding the above, the applicant shall provide the following minimum information
to the Township:
Name and address of the industry; name, title, and telephone number of responsible
official; name, title, and phone number of person to contact for information about the

user will provide such additional pretreatment. The Township shall include an acceptable
compliance schedule in the user's industrial waste discharge permit. The completion date
in this schedule shall be no later than the compliance date established by the EPA for the
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions apply
to this schedule:
The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the forms of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the significant industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components,
commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
No increment shall exceed nine months.
Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, the significant industrial user shall submit to the Township a report,
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to
be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
significant industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no
event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
Township.

Compliance schedules; and
Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Township to ensure compliance with
this article, other municipal ordinances or other requirements.
Issuance of an industrial waste discharge permit in no way relieves the significant
industrial user from any liability on account of its discharge into the sewerage system,
whether discharge is permitted thereby or not.
Permit duration. Industrial waste discharge permits shall be issued for a one-year period. If
the Township elects not to cancel the permit on or before its anniversary, the permit will
automatically renew itself for another period of one year upon payment by the industrial user
of the applicable permit renewal fee. The terms and conditions of the permit shall be subject
to modification by the Township during the term of the permit. The significant industrial user
shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective
date of change. The Township shall use its best efforts to inform the significant industrial user
at least 60 days prior to the effective date. In the event that such changes require major
changes in pretreatment by the significant industrial user, and the significant industrial user's
failure to comply with the amended discharge requirements does not itself or with other
failures to comply put the Township in substantial danger of violating any agreement, permit,
regulation or law, then the significant industrial user shall be allowed a reasonable period of
time to comply with the changes, provided the significant industrial user requests a time
extension and submits to the Township an implementation schedule acceptable to the
Township within the sixty-day period.
Permit transfer. Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a specific significant
industrial user for a specific operation. An industrial waste discharge permit shall not be
reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or
changed operation without the prior written approval of the Township. The succeeding owner
or industrial user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing industrial
waste discharge permit.
Waste characteristic change. Any industrial user who plans or becomes aware of a change in
the method of operation or in the pretreatment facilities which will increase the concentration
of pollutants which are regulated by this article or the volume of wastewater discharged to the
sewerage system shall notify the Township in writing of the change at least 90 days prior to
such change. If required by the Township, the industrial user shall apply for an industrial
waste discharge permit that reflects the proposed changes. The new industrial waste
discharge permit will be subject to a fee to reimburse the Township for all expenses incurred
as a result of the processing of the permit. Approval or denial of a new industrial waste
discharge permit shall be regulated by the procedures established hereunder for the issuance
of an original permit.

Files. The Township will maintain files in which copies of all industrial waste discharge
permits, revisions thereto, and supporting data will be filed for reference. Files shall be
maintained for a period of at least five years. This period of retention shall be extended during
the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the significant industrial user or the EWTP or
when requested by the Township, the Director of EPA or the Regional Administrator of EPA.
Reporting requirements for significant industrial users.
Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the sewerage system, any user subject
to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit to the Township a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by such categorical standards, and the average and maximum daily
flow from these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such categorical
standards. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical standards are being met
on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance and/or
pretreatment are scheduled to bring the significant industrial user into compliance with the
applicable categorical standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the user and certified by a qualified professional.
Periodic compliance reports.
Each significant industrial user shall submit to the Township, during the months of April,
July, October and January, unless required more frequently in the significant industrial
user's industrial waste discharge permit or by the Township, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the discharge during the quarterly reporting period
which are regulated by the industrial waste discharge permit. All monitoring data obtained
by valid analytical techniques must be reported by the significant industrial user. In
addition, this report, where applicable, shall include a record of all daily flows which,
during the reporting period, exceeded the maximum daily flow listed in the significant
industrial user's industrial waste discharge permit. At the discretion of the Township, and
in consideration of such factors as high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc.,
the Township, upon written request from the significant industrial user, may agree to alter
the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. The report shall also
contain the following certification statement signed by the authorized representative of
the user;
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared
under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that
qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on
my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
The Township may impose mass limitations where the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by § 200-25I(2)(a) of this article shall state
the mass of pollutants regulated by categorical standards in the significant industrial
user's discharge to the sewerage system. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Township of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the significant industrial user's industrial
waste discharge permit. All sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained

in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved
by the EPA.
For categorical industries that have mass limits as categorical standards, the Township
may specify equivalent concentrations to regulate the strength of the significant industrial
user's discharge. If concentration limits are regulated in lieu of mass discharge limits, the
significant industrial user must provide the Township with the following information as part
of each compliance report:
For the reporting period, the rate of production of the process for which categorical
standards have been established.
The average wastewater flow rate, generated by the regulated production activity for
the reporting period.
Thirty days' notice of any anticipated change in production.
The industrial wastewater discharged into the sewerage system shall be sampled and
analyzed by and at the expense of the significant industrial user, and copies of the
original laboratory reports listing the results of the analyses and the analytical methods
used shall be submitted to the Township, within 15 days of completion, with the
significant industrial user's periodic compliance report as required in § 200-25I(2)(a) of
this article. Frequency of sampling and analyses shall be at least quarter-annually, unless
required more frequently by the Township. Unless otherwise stated in the industrial waste
discharge permit, all samples are to be time composite samples for the period of
discharge or for 24 hours, whichever is less, with sampling intervals of not more than one
hour. The samples shall be analyzed for the substances and characteristics required by
the significant industrial user's industrial waste discharge permit. The significant industrial
user shall follow the proper sample preservation and analysis techniques detailed in 40
CFR 136 or other approved techniques approved by the Township.
All records and information resulting from the monitoring activities required by the
industrial waste discharge permit shall be retained by the significant industrial user for at
least five years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the significant industrial user or the EWTP or when
requested by the Township, the Director of EPA, or the Regional Administrator of EPA.
Baseline monitoring report.
Where a significant industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted the baseline monitoring information
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b), the significant industrial user shall, within 180 days after
the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, provide
this information to the Township. The report shall include all items required by 40 CFR
403.12(b).
A new source, or a user proposing to discharge wastes into the sewerage system that is
subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, shall submit to the Township the
baseline monitoring report required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) at least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge from the regulated process or facility.
Noncomplying discharge report. If sampling performed by a significant industrial user
indicates a violation of this article, an applicable pretreatment standard, or the significant
industrial user's industrial waste discharge permit, the significant industrial user shall notify
the Township within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Township within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.

Monitoring facilities.
All significant industrial users shall provide and operate, at their own expense, monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of its industrial waste
discharge. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the significant industrial
user's premises, but the Township may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the significant industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
The monitoring facility shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the Township. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition
at the expense of the significant industrial user. The facility shall be located as to be
accessible at all times to persons authorized by the Township. By obtaining an industrial
waste discharge permit, the significant industrial user consents to the entry upon its land, and
agrees to facilitate such entry, by representatives of the Township, and consents to the use of
the monitoring facility for observation, sampling, and measuring of the wastewater discharge
at all time. Construction of the monitoring facility shall be completed within 120 days following
issuance of the industrial waste discharge permit.
Inspection and sampling. The Township may inspect the facilities of any industrial user. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Township or its
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their
duties. The Township and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where an industrial user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the industrial user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Township or EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay.
Pretreatment.
Significant industrial users shall provide necessary pretreatment and flow equalization
facilities as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the appropriate federal regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat or flowequalize
wastewater to a level in compliance with the provisions of this article shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's sole expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Township for review before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent in compliance with the provisions of this article.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities, flow-equalizing facilities, or method of
operation shall be reported to and be approved by the Township prior to the industrial user's
initiation of the changes.
A significant industrial user may allow a bypass which does not cause pretreatment standards
to be violated, but only for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. If a significant
industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior written notice
to the Township, if possible, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass. A significant
industrial user shall give oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards to the Township within 24 hours from the time the significant industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report shall also be provided within five days of
the time the significant industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written report shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact

user specifically requests in writing and is able to demonstrate to the Township's satisfaction
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, those portions of a report that have been
accepted by the Township as confidential shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this article, the NPDES permit, state disposal system permit and/or the state or
federal pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of any report shall be
available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
When information accepted by the Township as confidential is transmitted to any
governmental agency by the Township, a notification to the industrial user shall be provided
by the Township listing the confidential information transmitted, and the governmental entity
requesting the information.

responsible for the reading of all meters or measuring devices. The meters and devices shall
be made available for meter reading at any reasonable time.
§ 200-26. Enforcement.
Immediate suspension by Township of discharge presenting imminent danger by any user. The
Township may order the suspension of discharge of wastewater by any user when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Township, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents an imminent danger or harm to people or to the environment or of
interference (dangerous discharge). Any user notified of an order to suspend shall comply
therewith immediately. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Township may take such steps as it deems necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to effect the suspension of discharge of the user's wastewater
into the sewerage system. The Township may permit reinstatement of the discharge upon proof
satisfactory to itself of the elimination of the imminent and substantial danger referred to above.
The user shall submit a detailed written statement to the Township describing the causes of the
actual or threatened discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence within 15
days of the date of the first such discharge or threat of discharge. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the Township from seeking injunctive relief hereunder or at common law or
taking other enforcement action in connection with a dangerous discharge.
Termination of service of any user. Any user who violates any provision of this article, applicable
state and federal regulations, or an industrial waste discharge permit if applicable, is subject, in
addition to any civil or criminal penalties which may be imposed, to having his service terminated
and/or his industrial waste discharge permit revoked.

mean the normal waterborne waste from a household, and toilet wastes from residences, business
buildings, institutions, commercial and industrial establishments.
§ 200-29. Sewer capacity reservation.
Sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity in the sewer system shall be reserved only in
accordance with the following rules and regulations:
Payment of tapping fees to reserve capacity.
No sanitary sewage transmission or treatment capacity shall be reserved for a developer or
landowner or in connection with a development unless the applicable tapping fees as may be
established from time to time by resolution of the Uwchlan Township Municipal Authority (the
"Authority") pursuant to 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 5601 et seq., as amended, have been paid in full.
A developer or landowner with subdivision or land development plans, whether preliminary or
final, approved prior to the effective date of this article may reserve sanitary sewage
transmission and treatment capacity for any future construction or development under the
plans by paying the applicable tapping fee, as described in Subsection A(1) above; however,
nothing set forth in this article shall be applied to affect adversely the right of a developer or
landowner pursuant to Section 508(4)(ii) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended, 53 P.S. § 10508(4)(ii) to commence and to complete any aspect of the approved
development in accordance with the terms of such approval within five years from such
approval.
No building permit for a building(s) depicted on a subdivision or land development plan
approved prior to the effective date of this article shall be issued unless at the time of
application therefor, adequate sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity has been
reserved to serve the use(s) proposed for the said building(s).
The reservation of capacity shall be deemed effective upon payment to and acceptance by
the Township of the appropriate fees. The date of acceptance of the fees by the Township
shall be deemed the "reservation date".
The use of the reserved capacity in the sewer system is subject to any ban or prohibition on
connections imposed by any governmental authority or agency, or by operation of law.
Payment of minimum sewer rates.
Unless timely connection is made to the sewer system within six months of the reservation
date, sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity in the sewer system shall be
reserved for those uses on the basis of which the tapping fee was calculated only for that
period commencing six months after the reservation date during which the minimum periodic
sewer rate is timely paid as billed by the Township for each such use.
On the 30th consecutive day on which minimum sewer rates have been billed and are due
and owing but have not been paid, the reservation of sanitary sewage transmission and
treatment capacity shall be automatically revoked and deemed forfeited with the identical
effect as if the same had never been reserved. On revocation, the developer or landowner
shall be entitled to a refund of all or a portion of the tapping fees paid for a period of up to five
years according to the following percentages:
From the reservation date up to and including the first anniversary of the reservation
date, 100% of the tapping fee;
From the first anniversary of the reservation date up to and including the second
anniversary of the reservation date, 80% of the tapping fee;

After the fifth anniversary of the reservation date, no refund of the tapping fee.
On revocation of the reserved sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity as
described in the preceding Subsection B(2) above, the Township shall inform the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Protection (the "DEP") of this
revocation by a notice in the form appended hereto as Appendix A.[1]
Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
Neither the Township nor the Authority shall have any reimbursement or refund obligation
whatsoever to a developer or landowner for any sewer rental fees paid by the developer or
landowner to preserve a reservation of sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity.
Approval of subdivision and land development plans. No subdivision and/or land development
plan shall be finally approved or released for recording unless the same prominently displays the
following textual note:
No building permit for a building(s) depicted in this plan shall be issued unless at the time of
application therefor, adequate sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity has been
reserved and is available to serve the use(s) proposed for the said building(s).
Approval of sewage planning modules. No planning module shall be certified by the Township or
the Authority to the DEP unless the same prominently displays the following textual note:
Sanitary sewage transmission and treatment capacity is hereby certified as available to serve the
development described herein only during such period as the said capacity shall be reserved by
the developer in conformity with the procedure described in Uwchlan Township Ordinance No.
96-02, the operative text of which is appended hereto and incorporated herein by reference as if
the same were here reprinted at length. The landowner and developer, by executing this
application hereby consents to the revocation of the reservation of sewage transmission and
treatment capacity in the event of failure to comply with the requirements specified in ordinance
No. 96-02. Landowner and developer here acknowledge and stipulate that their consent to such
revocation is a material inducement and that the Township would not have certified the
availability of such capacity in the absence of such consent.
§ 200-30. Sale or transfer of reserved capacity.
No developer or landowner shall be permitted to sell or transfer any capacity reserved to a parcel of
land by the developer or landowner to another parcel of land whether owned by the developer or
landowner or by a third party.

manufacturer's shop-applied acid-resisting, rust-inhibitive coating inside and outside. The
unit interior design shall incorporate removable flow baffle-through arrangement,
threaded inlet and outlet, and internal air relief, double wall internal trap or deep-seal
external trap, floor level cleanout provisions, and an anti-skip cover with a neoprene
sealing gasket.
Special types. Special type interceptors shall include those units which are not of the
types stated previously and are usually greater capacity. Special interceptors may be of
precast concrete construction for reasons of economy due to the larger size of such
units.
Location. Interceptors shall be located outside for all installations. Each unit shall be
serviceable on grade with the cover completely removable. The cover shall be surrounded by
a housekeeping pad of concrete construction. The interceptor shall be accessible at all times
to the plumbing official. Each proposed interceptor location shall be approved by the plumbing
official prior to installation.
Maintenance. The plumbing official shall initially require a written report indicating biweekly
interceptor grease draw-off quantities over a three-month time period. Such report shall be
submitted in letter form and shall clearly indicate the owner's name and address as well as
the information requested herein. The plumbing official shall review the submitted report and
shall make the determination as to the frequency of the interceptor grease draw-off. This
schedule of grease draw-off shall be strictly followed on a continual basis until such time as
the grease ladened discharge or drainage is discontinued by the owner's operations, or
unless subsequent experience demonstrates the need for more frequent draw-off. The
plumbing official reserves the right to change the schedule of grease draw-offs by increasing
or decreasing the frequency of draw-off times, based on his/her site inspections and
observations of operations.
§ 200-44. Prohibitions and restrictions on industrial users.
General.
No person shall discharge industrial wastewater into the sewerage system in violation of
§ 200-43 hereof and unless the person discharging the same has submitted a complete and
accurate industrial waste discharge questionnaire to DARA in the form prescribed by the
Executive Director, and has been issued an industrial waste discharge permit or has been
issued a written determination by the Township or the Executive Director that a permit is
unnecessary for the discharge described in the questionnaire.
Where a proposed discharge is believed by DARA to have a reasonable potential for
adversely impacting the sewerage system, DARA may require treatability studies to be
performed by the industrial user on the proposed wastewater in order to demonstrate its
compatibility with the sewerage system. When such studies are required by DARA, they shall
be preceded by the submittal of a treatability study plan by the industrial user to DARA for
review and approval. All costs associated with preparing the treatability study plan and
performing the treatability study shall be borne by the industrial user. DARA reserves the right

Spills or slug loads.
All industrial users shall provide and maintain at their own expense facilities adequate to
prevent an accidental discharge or slug load of any substance stored or used at the industrial
user's facilities that, if discharged into the sewerage system, will violate any of the provisions
of § 200-43A or 200-44B of this article. Slug control plans shall be submitted, as requested, to
the Township and DARA, detailing the facility plans and operating procedures to be utilized by
the industrial user for this protection.
Slug control plans shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine discharges; a description
of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the Executive Director and the Township of
accidental discharges and slug loads into the sewer system;
Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from such discharges and procedures to
prevent reoccurrence of all such discharges.
All existing industrial users shall also provide the Authority with a copy of its slug control
plan, or demonstrate to the satisfaction of DARA that such a plan is not needed, within
180 days of the adoption of this article. Industrial users proposing to connect to the
sewerage system after the effective date of this article shall submit a copy of its slug
control plan to the Township and to DARA for approval, or demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Township and DARA that they are not needed, before connection to the sewerage
system. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from
the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this article.
In addition, where an industrial user plans or becomes aware of a change in its method of
operation that may affect its potential to create a slug load to the public sewer system the
user shall notify DARA and the Township of the change so that DARA may reevaluate the
need for a slug control plan from the user.
In the case of a slug load to the sewerage system of any pollutant, the industrial user shall
immediately notify by telephone the Executive Director and the Township of the incident. The
notification shall include information regarding the location of the discharge, the kind of
pollutants involved, the concentration and volume of the discharge and corrective actions
planned or taken.
Within five days following a slug load, the industrial user shall submit to the Township, and to
the Executive Director, a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the
measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the users of any liability on account thereof.
A notice shall be permanently posted by each industrial user on a bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge or
slug load. Employers shall inform all employees who may cause or allow a slug load to occur,
of the emergency notification procedure.
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. If the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards,
located in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, for any industrial user are more
stringent than limitations imposed under this article for industrial users in that subcategory, then
the pretreatment standards shall apply and are hereby incorporated in this article. DARA shall
notify all affected industrial users of the applicable (reporting) requirements under 40 CFR Section
8/17/2020 Township of Uwchlan, PA Ecode360

403.12. If an industrial user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not
previously submitted an application for an industrial waste discharge permit, the user shall apply
for a permit within 90 days of promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
Dilution prohibition. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement, no industrial user shall increase the use of process water,
or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. DARA may impose
mass limitations (in addition to those imposed under § 200-44C) on users in cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
State requirements. State requirements and limitations on industrial wastewater discharges shall
apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those
in this article.
DARA's right of revision. The Township and DARA reserve the right to establish more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the sewerage system.
Industrial waste discharge permits.
General.
No significant industrial user shall connect to or discharge wastewater to the sewerage
system without an industrial waste discharge permit. Nonsignificant industrial users may
also be required to have an industrial waste discharge permit depending on the nature
and quantity of their discharge, subject to the Authority's discretion.
Industrial users that are not required by the Authority to have an industrial waste
discharge permit may discharge industrial wastewater to the sewerage system, but are
required to comply with all other provisions of this article. If an industrial user makes
changes to the processes, flow, wastewater concentration, wastewater characteristics, or
other operations reported in the most recent industrial waste discharge questionnaire
filed by the user with DARA, user shall immediately upon becoming aware such a change
has occurred, or 90 days prior to such a change if it is planned, notify DARA and the
Township of the change, and a determination will be made by DARA whether the
change(s) necessitate the issuance of an industrial waste discharge permit to the user.
Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted an application for an industrial
waste discharge permit, the user shall, within 90 days after the promulgation of the
application National Categorical Pretreatment Standard:
Obtain an industrial waste discharge permit; and
Provide the baseline monitoring information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b). This
information shall be incorporated into the application for an industrial waste
discharge permit.

The industrial waste discharge permit application shall be reviewed by the Township, and
if acceptable, submitted to the Executive Director for review. The Executive Director will
review the application and make a determination as to whether a permit will be required
for the discharge. No industrial waste discharge permit shall be issued to an industrial
user whose discharge of materials to sewers, whether shown upon the application or
determined after inspection and testing conducted by the Township or DARA, is not in
conformance with federal, state, Township, or DARA statutes, or resolutions. If an
application is denied, the Executive Director shall state in writing the reason or reasons
for denial, and said written communication shall be delivered to the Township and the
applicant.
If the Executive Director or the Township denies an application for an industrial waste
discharge permit, the DARA Board shall review the denial, provided the industrial user
gives written notice requesting the review, with appropriate support information within 30
days after receipt of the denial. The DARA Board shall review the industrial waste
discharge permit application, the written denial, and such other evidence and matters as
the applicant shall present at its next regular meeting following receipt of the user's
request for the review. The Board's decision shall be provided to the user within 10 days
of the meeting and shall be final.
If, based on the characteristics of the industrial user's waste discharge, additional
pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance procedures are required to meet any
DARA, Township, state or federal pretreatment standards, the user shall submit to DARA,
prior to issuance of the industrial waste discharge permit, the shortest, reasonable
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment. DARA shall include
an acceptable compliance schedule in the user's industrial waste discharge permit. The
completion date in this schedule shall be no later than the compliance date established
by EPA for the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following
conditions apply to this schedule:
The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the forms of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the significant industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components,
commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
No increment shall exceed nine months.
Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, the industrial user shall submit to the DARA and the Township a report,
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to
be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to
return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine
months elapse between such progress reports to DARA and the Township.
Permit modifications. As soon as possible following the promulgation of a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the industrial waste discharge permit of users subject to
such standards shall be revised, if necessary, to require compliance with such standard within
the time prescribed by such standard.
Permit conditions.
Industrial waste discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this
article and all other applicable regulations, ordinances, user charges and fees
established by DARA and the Township. Permits shall contain the following:

proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. DARA
and the Township shall use their best efforts to inform the user at least 60 days prior to the
effective date. In the event that such changes require major changes in pretreatment by the
user, and the user's failure to comply with the amended discharge requirements does not
itself or with other failures to comply put DARA or the Township in substantial danger of
violating any agreement, permit, regulation or law, then the user shall be allowed a
reasonable period of time to comply with the changes, provided the user requests a time
extension and submits to DARA and the Township an implementation schedule acceptable to
DARA and the Township within the sixty-day period.
Permit transfer. Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a specific industrial user for a
specific operation. An industrial waste discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred
or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without
the approval of DARA and the Township. The succeeding owner or user shall also comply
with the terms and conditions of the existing industrial waste discharge permit.
Waste characteristic change. Any industrial user who plans or becomes aware of a change in
the method of operation or in the pretreatment facilities which will increase the concentration
of pollutants which are regulated by this article or the volume of wastewater discharged to the
sewerage system, shall notify DARA and the Township of the change at least 90 days prior to
such change. If required by DARA or the Township, the industrial user shall apply for an
industrial waste discharge permit that reflects the proposed changes. The new industrial
waste discharge permit will be subject to a fee to reimburse DARA and the Township for all
expenses incurred as a result of the processing of the permit. Approval or denial of a new
industrial waste discharge permit shall be regulated by the procedures established hereunder
for the issuance of an original permit.
Files. DARA and the Township shall maintain files in which copies of all industrial waste
discharge permits, revisions thereto, and supporting data will be filed for reference. Files shall
be maintained for a period of at least five years. This period of retention shall be extended
during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the user or the DRWPCC or when
requested by DARA, the Director of EPA or the Regional Administrator of EPA.
Reporting requirements for industrial users.
Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the sewerage system, any industrial
user subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit to DARA and the
Township a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge
from the regulated process which are limited by categorical standards, and the average and
maximum daily flow from these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such
categorical standards. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance
and/or pretreatment are scheduled to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
categorical standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and certified by a qualified professional.
Periodic compliance reports.
Each permitted industrial user shall submit to DARA and the Township, during the
months of April, July, October and January, or as specified in the user's industrial waste
discharge permit or by DARA, a complete and accurate report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge during the reporting period which are
regulated by the industrial waste discharge permit. All monitoring data obtained for
purposes of determining compliance with the industrial waste discharge permit by
certified analytical techniques must be reported by the user. In addition, this report, where
applicable, shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period,

exceeded the maximum daily flow listed in the industrial waste discharge permit. At the
discretion of DARA and the Township and in consideration of such factors as high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., DARA, upon written request from the user, may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. The report
shall also contain the following certification statement signed by the authorized
representative of the user:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared
under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that
qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on
my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
The Township or DARA may impose mass limitations where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by § 200-44J(2)(a) of this
article shall state the mass of pollutants regulated by categorical standards in the
industrial user's discharge to the sewerage system. These reports shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by DARA, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the user's industrial waste discharge
permit. All sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
EPA.
For categorical industries that have mass limits as categorical standards, DARA may
specify equivalent concentrations to regulate the strength of the industrial user's
discharge. If concentration limits are regulated in lieu of mass discharge limits, the user
must provide DARA with the following information as part of each compliance report:
For the reporting period, the rate of production of the process for which categorical
standards have been established.
The average wastewater flow rate, generated by the regulated production activity for
the reporting period.
Thirty days' notice of any anticipated change in production.
The industrial wastewater discharged into the sewerage system shall be sampled and
analyzed by and at the expense of the industrial user, and copies of the original
laboratory reports listing the results of the analyses and the analytical methods used shall
be submitted to DARA and the Township, with the user's periodic compliance report
required in § 200-44J(2)(a) of this article. In cases where the standard requires
compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user
shall submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable
standards to determine compliance with the standard. Frequency of sampling and
analyses shall be quarterly, or as specified by the industrial waste discharge permit or
DARA. Unless otherwise stated in the industrial waste discharge permit, all samples are
to be time composite samples for the period of discharge or for 24 hours, whichever is
less, with sampling intervals of not more than one hour. The samples shall be analyzed
for the substances and characteristics required by the user's industrial waste discharge
permit and shall be representative of the conditions occurring during the reporting period.
The user shall follow the proper sample preservation and analysis techniques detailed in
40 CFR 136 or other approved techniques approved by DARA.

litigation regarding the user or the DRWPCC or when requested by the Township, DARA
or the Director of EPA, or the Regional Administrator of EPA.
Baseline monitoring report.
Where a significant industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted the baseline monitoring information
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b), the user shall, within 180 days after the promulgation of
the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, provide this information to
DARA. The report shall include all items required by 40 CFR 403.12(b).
A new source, or a user proposing to discharge wastes into the sewerage system that is
subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, shall submit to DARA the
baseline monitoring report required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) at least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge from the regulated process or facility.
Noncomplying discharge report. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a
violation of this article, an applicable pretreatment standard, or the user's industrial waste
discharge permit, the user shall notify DARA and the Township within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to DARA and the Township within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation.
Monitoring facilities.
All permitted industrial users shall provide and operate, at their own expense, monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of its industrial waste
discharge. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
Township may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
The monitoring facility shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by DARA and the Township. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition
at the expense of the user. The facility shall be located as to be accessible at all times to
persons authorized by DARA or the Township. By obtaining an industrial waste discharge
permit, the user consents to the entry upon its land, and agrees to facilitate such entry, by
representatives of DARA and the Township, and consents to the use of the monitoring facility
for observation, sampling, and measuring of the wastewater discharge at all time.
Construction of the monitoring facility shall be completed within 120 days following issuance
of the industrial waste discharge permit.
Inspection and sampling. DARA or the Township may inspect the facilities of the user. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow DARA or its
representative, and the Township or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or
in the performance of any of their duties. DARA, the Township, and EPA shall have the right to set
up on the industrial user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force
which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from DARA, the Township, or EPA will be permitted to enter, without
delay.

Pretreatment.
All industrial users shall provide necessary pretreatment and flow-equalizing facilities as
required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the appropriate
federal regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat or flow-equalize wastewater to a level in
compliance with the provisions of this article shall be provided, operated, and maintained at
the user's sole expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to DARA and the Township for review before construction of
the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent in
compliance with the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities, flow-equalizing facilities, or method of operation shall be reported to and be
approved by DARA and the Township prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
An industrial user may allow a bypass which does not cause pretreatment standards to be
violated, but only for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. If the user knows in
advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to DARA and the Township, if
possible, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass. A user shall give oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to DARA and the
Township within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written
report shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements
shall be made available to officials of the EPA upon request.
DARA and the Township shall have access to all such pretreatment facilities and flowequalizing
facilities as required by this article at all reasonable times for purposes of
inspection and testing.
The Township shall reimburse DARA for all of its expenses incurred as a result of review,
monitoring, application processing, sampling, or any other activities conducted by DARA and
directly related to ensuring the industrial user's compliance with the provisions of this article.
Such expenses shall be subject to reimbursement to the Township by the industrial user.
Hazardous waste discharge notification.
An industrial user discharging any quantity of waste to the sewerage system, which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be an acute hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261, shall provide
a one-time notification to the Township, DARA, the EPA Region III Waste Management
Division Director, and the state hazardous waste authorities.
The notification required by § 200-44N(1) of this article shall include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other), and a certification that the industrial user has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical. If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste in a month to the sewerage system, the notification shall also include
an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the waste, as estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents discharged during the month, and an estimation
of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged by the user to the sewerage system
during the following twelve-month period.

noncompliance as defined in this article.
Immediate suspension by the Township of discharge presenting imminent danger by any user.
The Township shall order the suspension of discharge of wastewater by any user when so
directed by DARA. DARA may direct such a suspension when such suspension is necessary,
in the opinion of DARA, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents an
imminent danger or harm to people or to the environment or of interference (dangerous
discharge).
Any user notified of an order to suspend shall comply therewith immediately. In the event of a
failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township shall take
such steps as it deems necessary and, if directed by DARA, as directed by DARA, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to affect the suspension of discharge of the
user's wastewater into the sewerage system. The Township shall permit reinstatement of the
discharge upon proof satisfactory to itself and DARA of the elimination of the imminent and
substantial danger referred to above. The user shall submit a detailed written statement to
DARA describing the causes of the actual or threatened discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence within 15 days of the date of the first such discharge or threat
of discharge.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit DARA from seeking injunctive relief hereunder or
at common law or taking other enforcement action in connection with a dangerous discharge.
Termination of service of any user. Any user who violates any condition of this article, applicable
state and federal regulations or an industrial waste discharge permit if applicable is subject, in
addition to any civil or criminal penalties which may be imposed, to having his service terminated
and/or his industrial waste discharge permit revoked.
Notification of violation by any user. Whenever DARA or the Township finds that the user has
violated or is violating this article, an industrial waste discharge permit, or any prohibition,
limitation or requirements contained herein, or has failed to provide the Executive Director with the
information needed to accurately determine compliance with any pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Township or DARA may, and the Township at the direction of DARA shall, serve
upon such person a written notice of violation. The notice may require a response in the form of a
plan, explanation, compliance schedule, or other appropriate response within a specified time
period. Compliance with any such requirement is mandatory.

§ 214-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Uwchlan Township's Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 214-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and
development throughout a watershed increases flooding, flows and velocities, contributes to
erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases
the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces infiltration and
groundwater recharge, increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways, and threatens public
health and safety.

Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance and
development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural
hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of streambeds
and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and
pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including minimization of impacts of new
development, redevelopment, and other earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff
and erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater recharge for
water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater
generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain
high water quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. Cost-effective and
environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved through the use of
nonstructural site design techniques that minimize impervious surfaces, reduce disturbance of
land and natural resources, avoid sensitive areas (i.e., riparian buffers, floodplains, steep slopes,
wetlands, etc.), and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
Federal and state regulations require the municipality to implement a program of stormwater
controls. The municipality is required to obtain a permit and comply with its provisions for
stormwater discharges from its separate storm sewer system under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
Nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution
of the waters of the commonwealth.
§ 214-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, safety and general welfare, property and water
quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management practices, criteria, and provisions
included herein for land development, construction and earth disturbance activities, to achieve the
following throughout the municipality:
Reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting people,
property, infrastructure and public services.
Sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of groundwater and
surface waters.
Protect natural resources, including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats.
Maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and their receiving watersheds.
Minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features, drainage
patterns, infiltration, and flow conditions within land development site designs.
Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated, and manage and release stormwater
as close to the source of runoff as possible.

§ 214-9. Compatibility with other ordinances or legal
requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility to secure and comply with other required permits or approvals for activities regulated
by any other applicable code, rule, act, law, regulation, or ordinance.
To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous or stringent requirements for stormwater
management than any other code, rule, act, law, regulation or ordinance, the specific requirements
contained in this chapter shall take precedence.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the municipality's requirements
regarding stormwater matters that do not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, such as local
stormwater management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection system design
and details, outlet structure design, etc.). The requirements of this chapter shall supersede any
conflicting requirements in other municipal ordinances or regulations.
§ 214-10. Financial security.
For all activities requiring submittal of a stormwater management (SWM) site plan that involve
subdivision or land development, the applicant shall post financial security to the municipality for the
timely installation and proper construction of all stormwater management facilities as required by the
approved SWM site plan and this chapter, and such financial security shall:
Be equal to or greater than the full construction cost of the required facilities except to the extent
that financial security for the cost of any of such improvements is required to be and is posted with
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in connection with a highway occupancy permit
application; and
Be determined, collected, applied and enforced in accordance with Sections 509 through 511 of
the MPC and the provisions of the municipality's Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
(SALDO).[1]

impracticable to meet any one or more of the mandatory minimum standards of this chapter on the
site, the municipality may approve measures other than those in this chapter, subject to
Subsections B and C.
The governing body shall have the authority to waive or modify the requirements of one or more
provisions of this chapter if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the purpose and intent of the chapter is observed. Cost or financial
burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may also be considered if an alternative
standard or approach can be demonstrated to provide equal or better achievement of the results
intended by the chapter. A request for modification shall be in writing and accompany the SWM
site plan submission. The request shall state in full the grounds and facts on which the request is
based, the provision or provisions of the chapter involved and the minimum modification
necessary.

Article III. Stormwater Management Standards
§ 214-15. General requirements.
Applicants proposing regulated activities in the municipality which are not exempt under § 214-6
shall submit a stormwater management site plan (SWM site plan) to the municipality for review
and approval in accordance with Articles III and IV. SWM site plans approved by the municipality
shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
The stormwater management and runoff control criteria and standards in this chapter shall apply
to the total proposed regulated activity, even if it is to take place in stages. The measurement of
impervious surfaces shall include all of the impervious surfaces in the total proposed regulated
activity even if the development is to take place in stages.
No regulated activity within the municipality shall commence until:
The municipality issues approval of a SWM site plan, which demonstrates compliance with
the requirements of this chapter; and
The applicant has received a letter of adequacy or approval for the erosion and sediment
control plan review by the municipality and the Conservation District (if required), and has
received all other local, state and federal permit approvals required for the project involving
the regulated activity.
Neither submission of a SWM site plan under the provisions herein nor compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person or
property otherwise imposed by law.
The applicant shall design the site to minimize disturbances to land, site hydrology, and natural
resources, and to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions.
The applicant shall apply the procedures set forth in § 214-18 for the overall site design and for
selection, location and design of features and BMPs to be used to comply with the requirements of
this chapter.
To the maximum extent practicable, postconstruction stormwater shall be discharged within the
drainage area of the same stream or water body receiving the runoff prior to construction of the
proposed regulated activity.

For regulated activities with one acre or more of proposed earth disturbance, existing drainage
peak rate discharges up to and including the one-hundred-year storm onto or through adjacent
property(ies) or downgradient property(ies), including diffuse drainage discharge, shall not be
altered in any manner without written permission from, and, where applicable as determined by
the municipality an easement and agreement with, the affected landowner(s) for conveyance of
discharges onto or through their property(ies). Such discharge shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated activity) that drain through a
proposed site are not subject to water quality and volume control, infiltration, stream channel
protection, or peak flow rate control requirements (as presented in §§ 214-19, 214-20, 214-21, and
214-22). Drainage facilities located on the site shall be designed to safely convey flows from
outside of the site through the site.
If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from limited portions of the disturbed area for achieving
water quality volume control standards, stream channel protection standards, and the two-, five-,
and ten-year storm event peak runoff rate reduction standards for new development required by
this chapter, the applicant shall propose alternate methods to mitigate the bypass of the BMPs,
subject to the approval of the Municipal Engineer. In no case shall resulting peak rate be greater
than the predevelopment peak rate for the equivalent design storm.
For all regulated activities, erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained during the regulated activities (i.e., during construction) as required to
meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter, to meet the erosion and sediment control
requirements of the municipality, if applicable, and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the
Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law.[1]
Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
For all regulated activities, permanent BMPs and conveyances shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the
Stormwater Management Act.[2]
Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq. and 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., respectively.
The design of all BMPs and conveyances shall incorporate sound engineering principles and
practices in a manner that does not aggravate existing stormwater problems as identified by the
municipality. The municipality reserves the right to disapprove any design that would result in
construction in an area affected by existing stormwater problem(s) or continuation of an existing
stormwater problem(s).
Existing wetlands, either on the site or on an adjacent property, shall not be used to meet the
minimum design requirements for stormwater management or stormwater runoff quality treatment.
Stormwater discharges to existing wetlands shall not degrade the quality or hydrologic integrity of
the wetland.
Hotspots runoff controls. Specific structural or pollution prevention practices may be required, as
determined to be necessary by the Municipal Engineer, to pretreat runoff from hotspots prior to
infiltration. Following is a list of examples of hotspots:
Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities;
Vehicle fueling stations;
Vehicle service and maintenance facilities;
Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities;
Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.);

Contaminated and brownfield sites. Where BMPs may contribute to the migration of contaminants
in groundwater, the water quality and runoff volume, stream channel protection, and peak rate
control standards shall be met; however, at the Municipal Engineer's discretion, the minimum
infiltration requirement may be reduced or eliminated commensurate with the contaminated area
and the required water quality and runoff control measures may be increased to mitigate the
reduced infiltration requirement for the contaminated area.

vulnerable to contamination, drainage areas to water supply reservoirs, etc.).
Applicants shall utilize the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (PA
BMP Manual), as amended, or other sources acceptable to the Municipal Engineer, for testing and
design standards for BMPs, and where there is a conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the
most restrictive applies.
For areas underlain by karst or carbonate geology that may be susceptible to the formation of
sinkholes and other karst features, the location, type, and design of infiltration BMPs shall be
based on a site evaluation conducted by a qualified licensed professional and based on the PA
BMP Manual or other design guidance acceptable to the Municipal Engineer.
All regulated activities located within a special flood hazard area designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall comply with § 510 of the Uwchlan Township
Zoning Ordinance, as amended, and shall be designed to maintain the flood-carrying capacity of

The applicant shall design the site to minimize the disturbances to land, site hydrology, and natural
resources, and to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions. For
regulated activities with 10,000 or more square feet of proposed earth disturbance or 2,000 or more
square feet of proposed impervious surfaces, the applicant shall demonstrate in its SWM site plan (as
required in § 214-27C) that the design sequence, objectives and techniques described below were
applied to the maximum extent practicable in the site design of the regulated activity while complying
with all other requirements of this chapter. The site design shall:
First, identify and delineate all existing natural resources and natural and man-made hydrologic
features listed in § 214-27B(8) that are located within the site, or receive discharge from, or may
be impacted by, the proposed regulated activity.
Second, provide a prioritized listing of these resources and features to identify:
Those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides protection from any
disturbance or impact from the proposed regulated activity;
Those to be protected from further disturbance or impact but for which the proposed regulated
activity will provide improvement to existing conditions;
Those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design in a
manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their hydrologic
function within the limits of their available capacity (e.g., for infiltration, evapotranspiration, or
reducing pollutant loads, runoff volume or peak discharge rates, etc.) to reduce the need for
or size of constructed BMPs; and
Those that may be considered for alteration, disturbance or removal.
Third, develop the site design to achieve the following:
Recognize and incorporate the priorities identified in § 214-18B as the basis for the proposed
site layout, grading, construction, and permanent ground cover design;
Minimize earth disturbance (both surface and subsurface);
Maximize protection of or improvement to natural resources and special management areas;
Minimize the disturbance of natural site hydrology, in particular natural drainage features and
patterns, discharge points and flow characteristics, natural infiltration patterns and
characteristics, and natural channel and floodplain conveyance capacity;
Incorporate natural hydrologic features and functions identified in § 214-18B into the site
design to protect and utilize those features and their hydrologic functions to reduce the need
for or size of constructed BMPs;
Maximize infiltration and the use of natural site infiltration features, patterns and conditions,
and evapotranspiration features;
Apply selective grading design methods to provide final grading patterns or preserve existing
topography in order to evenly distribute runoff and minimize concentrated flows;
Minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious surfaces; and:
Minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces;
Separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components;
Disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another; and

Utilize porous materials in place of impervious wherever practicable;
Minimize the volume and peak discharge rates of stormwater generated;
Avoid or minimize stormwater runoff pollutant loads and receiving stream channel erosion;
Locate infiltration and other BMPs:
At or as near to the source of generation as possible; and
At depths that are as shallow as possible;
Prioritize the selection and design of BMPs as follows:
Nonstructural and vegetation BMPs; then
Structural (surface and subsurface) BMPs;
For flow volumes requiring conveyance from the source of generation to a BMP for
management, give preference to open channel conveyance techniques that provide infiltration
and water quality benefits, and landscape-based management in common open space areas,
where practicable; and
Consider additional guidance for incorporating natural hydrology into the site and BMP
designs, methods and techniques that support the objectives of § 214-18B and C. Appendix B
presents additional discussion of natural hydrology site design and sources of information for
conservation design, low-impact design, and sustainable design.[1]
Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
The procedures set forth above shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable for the overall
site design and selection, location and design of features and BMPs to be used to comply with the
requirements of §§ 214-19, 214-20, 214-21 and 214-22.
§ 214-19. Water quality and runoff volume requirements.
To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated activities and meet state water quality
requirements, BMPs shall be provided in the site design that replicate predevelopment stormwater
infiltration and runoff conditions, such that postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the
physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. The applicant shall comply with
the following water quality and runoff volume requirements for all regulated activities, including all new
development and redevelopment activities:
The postconstruction total runoff volume shall not exceed the predevelopment total runoff volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration precipitation (design
storm). The water quality and runoff volume to be managed shall consist of any runoff volume
generated by the proposed regulated activity over and above the predevelopment total runoff
volume and shall be captured and permanently retained or infiltrated on the site. Permanent
retention options may include, but are not limited to, reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.
For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be determined using
the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in § 214-23D of this chapter.
The design of the facility outlet shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.

BMPs that moderate the temperature of stormwater shall be used to protect the temperature of
receiving waters.
Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with achieving the infiltration
requirements of § 214-20. The infiltration volume required under § 214-20 may be included as a
component of the water quality volume. If the calculated water quality and runoff volume is greater
than the volume infiltrated, then the difference between the two volumes shall be managed for
water quality and runoff volume control through other techniques or practices but shall not be
discharged from the site.
Runoff from the disturbed area shall be treated for water quality prior to entering existing
waterways or water bodies. If a stormwater management practice does not provide water quality
treatment, then water quality BMPs shall be utilized to provide pretreatment prior to the runoff
entering the stormwater management practice.
The municipality may require additional water quality and runoff control measures for stormwater
discharging to special management areas such as those listed in § 214-15P.
When the regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the water quality and
runoff volume shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
Weighted averaging of runoff coefficients shall not be used for manual computations or input data
for water quality and runoff volume calculations.
Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated activity) may be excluded
from the calculation of the water quality and runoff volume requirements.
Water quality and volume control practices shall be selected and designed to meet the criteria of
§ 214-18C that apply to water quality and volume control.
§ 214-20. Infiltration requirements.
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime is required to compensate for the
reduction in the recharge that occurs when the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is
created or expanded. The applicant shall achieve the following infiltration requirements:
Wherever possible, infiltration should be designed to accommodate the entire water quality and
runoff volume required in § 214-19.
For regulated activities involving new development, the volume of a minimum of one inch of runoff
from all proposed impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated.
For regulated activities involving redevelopment, whichever is less of the following volume options
shall be infiltrated:
The volume of a minimum of one inch of runoff from all proposed impervious surfaces; or
The total water quality and runoff volume required in § 214-19 of this chapter.
If the requirements of § 214-20B or C cannot be physically accomplished, then the applicant shall
be responsible for demonstrating with data or calculations to the satisfaction of the Municipal
Engineer why this infiltration volume cannot be physically accomplished on the site (e.g., shallow
depth to bedrock or limiting zone, open voids, steep slopes, etc.) and what alternative volume can
be infiltrated; however in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of runoff volume shall be infiltrated.
Only if a minimum of at least 0.5 inch infiltration requirement cannot be physically accomplished
on the site shall a waiver from § 214-20 be considered by the municipality. Waivers shall follow the

procedures in § 214-11.
If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions of the impervious surfaces, the infiltration
volume for the remaining area shall be increased an equivalent amount to offset the loss.
When a project contains or is divided by multiple watersheds, the infiltration volume shall be
separately addressed for each watershed.
Existing impervious surfaces located in areas outside of the site (i.e., outside of the regulated
activity) may be excluded from the calculation of the required infiltration volume.
A detailed soils evaluation of the site shall be conducted by a qualified professional and at a
minimum shall address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be conducted by a qualified licensed professional
and shall be consistent with the PA BMP Manual (as amended) (or other guidance acceptable to
the Municipal Engineer) and in general shall:
Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within the site to
determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where development on
fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of subgrade stability;
infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.
Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or other hydraulic conductivity tests (at the
elevation of the proposed infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Standard septic/sewage percolation tests are not acceptable for design
purposes.
Design the infiltration facility for the required retention (infiltration) volume based on fielddetermined
infiltration capacity (and apply safety factor as per applicable design guidelines) at
the elevation of the proposed infiltration surface.
On-lot infiltration features are encouraged; however, it shall be demonstrated to the Municipal
Engineer that the soils are conducive to infiltration on the identified lots.
Infiltration BMPs shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions and shall be
constructed on soils that have the following characteristics:
A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and the top of the limiting
zone. Additional depth may be required in areas underlain by karst or carbonate geology (see
§ 214-20N).
An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater volume and drain completely
as determined by field tests conducted by the applicant.
The infiltration facility shall completely drain the retention (infiltration) volume within three
days (72 hours) from the end of the design storm.
All infiltration practices shall:
Be selected and designed to meet the criteria of § 214-18C that are applicable to infiltration;
Be set back at least 10 feet from all buildings and features with subgrade elements (e.g.,
basements, foundation walls, etc.), unless otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer;
Be set back at least five feet from all property lines;
For any infiltration practice that collects runoff from shared or multiple features and that is
located within 15 feet of a building or feature with subgrade elements (e.g., basements,

foundation walls, etc.), the bottom elevation shall be set below the elevation of the subgrade
element.
Infiltration facilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be located to avoid introducing
contaminants to groundwater:
When a hotspot is located in the area draining to a proposed infiltration facility, an evaluation
of the potential of groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration facility shall be
performed, including a hydrogeologic investigation (if necessary) by a qualified licensed
professional to determine what, if any, pretreatment or additional design considerations are
needed to protect groundwater quality.
When located within a "wellhead protection area" of a public water supply well, infiltration
practices shall be in conformance with the applicable approved source water protection
assessment or source water protection plan.
The applicant shall provide appropriate safeguards against groundwater contamination for
land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
During site construction, all infiltration practice components shall be protected from compaction
due to heavy equipment operation or storage of fill or construction material. Infiltration areas shall
also be protected from sedimentation. Areas that are accidentally compacted or graded shall be
remediated to restore soil composition and porosity. Adequate documentation to this effect shall
be submitted to the Municipal Engineer for review. All areas designated for infiltration shall not
receive runoff until the contributory drainage area has achieved final stabilization.
Consideration of infiltration BMPs for areas underlain by karst or carbonate geology is
encouraged, but only where the design, supporting calculations, results of soils or other site
investigations or other documentation are provided to the municipality demonstrating that the
potential or likelihood of subsidence or sinkholes is minimal. Evaluation of site conditions and
infiltration design shall rely on guidance in the PA BMP Manual (as amended) or other guidance
acceptable to the Municipal Engineer.
Groundwater quality of the carbonate aquifer shall be protected from infiltration of pollutants. At a
minimum, stormwater runoff from hotspots (i.e., sources of significant pollutant runoff) shall first be
discharged through a water quality BMP(s) to remove pollutants prior to infiltration. Where soil
characteristics are insufficient to provide removal of pollutants from sources other than hotspots,
stormwater runoff shall first be discharged through a water quality BMP(s) to remove pollutants
prior to infiltration.
Where sediment transport in the stormwater runoff is anticipated to reach the infiltration system,
appropriate permanent measures to prevent or collect sediment shall be installed prior to
discharge to the infiltration system.
Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration practices, they shall have appropriate
measures to prevent clogging by unwanted debris (for example, silt, leaves and vegetation). Such
measures shall include but are not limited to leaf traps, gutter guards and cleanouts.
All infiltration practices shall have appropriate positive overflow controls.
No sand, salt or other particulate matter may be applied to a porous surface material for winter ice
conditions.
The following procedures and materials shall be required during the construction of all subsurface
facilities:
Excavation for the infiltration facility shall be performed with equipment that will not compact
the bottom of the seepage bed/trench or like facility.

The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified prior to the placement of aggregate.
Only clean aggregate with documented porosity, free of fines, shall be allowed.
The tops, bottoms and sides of all seepage beds, trenches, or like facilities shall be covered
with drainage fabric. Fabric shall be nonwoven fabric acceptable to the Municipal Engineer.
Stormwater shall be distributed throughout the entire seepage bed/trench or like facility and
provisions for the collection of debris shall be provided in all facilities.
§ 214-21. Stream channel protection requirements.
For regulated activities involving new development with one or more acres of earth disturbance, the
applicant shall comply with the following stream channel protection requirements to minimize stream
channel erosion and associated water quality impacts to the receiving waters:
The peak flow rate of the postconstruction two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm shall be
reduced to the predevelopment peak flow rate of the one-year, twenty-four-hour-duration
precipitation, using the SCS Type II distribution.
To the maximum extent practicable, and unless otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer, the
postconstruction one-year, twenty-four-hour storm flow shall be detained for a minimum of 24
hours and a maximum not to exceed 72 hours from a point in time when the maximum volume of
water from the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., when the
maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin at the
start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the orifice is at the invert of the proposed BMP).
For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be determined using
the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in § 214-23D of this chapter.
The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be three inches in diameter
unless otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer, and a trash rack shall be installed to
prevent clogging. For sites with small drainage areas contributing to the BMP that do not provide
enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the
calculations shall be submitted showing this condition.
When the calculated orifice size is below three inches, gravel filters (or other methods) are
recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to the Municipal Engineer's satisfaction. When
filters are utilized, maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the design
function.
All proposed stormwater facilities shall make use of measures to extend the flow path and
increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
When a regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the peak flow rate
control shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.

For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be determined using
the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in § 214-23D of this chapter.
For regulated activities involving only redevelopment, no peak flow rate controls are required when
and only if the total proposed impervious surface area is at least 20% less than the total existing
impervious surface area to be disturbed by the regulated activity. In all cases where this
requirement is not met, the redevelopment regulated activity shall achieve the peak flow rate
controls presented in Table 22.1, using the redevelopment ground cover assumptions presented in
§ 214-23D.
Only the area of the proposed regulated activity shall be subject to the peak flow rate control
standards of this chapter. Undisturbed areas for which the discharge point has not changed are
not subject to the peak flow rate control standards.
Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated activity) that drain through a
proposed site are not subject to peak flow rate control requirements. Drainage facilities located on
the site shall be designed to safely convey flows from outside of the site through the site.
When a regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the peak flow rate
controls shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
The effect of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices implemented as part
of the overall site design may be taken into consideration when calculating total storage volume
and peak flow rates.
§ 214-23. Calculation methodology.
Stormwater runoff from all regulated activity sites with a drainage area of greater than five acres
shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation technique(s) that is based on the NRCS
Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 23.1 summarizes acceptable computation methods. The
method selected for use shall be based on the individual limitations and suitability of each method
for a particular site. The use of the Rational Method to estimate peak discharges for drainage
areas greater than five acres shall be permitted only upon approval by the Municipal Engineer.

recommended in the respective model used. Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow
shall be computed using Manning's equation.
The applicant shall utilize the following ground cover assumptions for all predevelopment water
quality and runoff volume, infiltration volume and peak flow rate calculations:
For regulated activities involving new development, the following ground cover assumptions
shall be used:
For areas that are woods (as defined in Article II of this chapter), predevelopment
calculations shall assume ground cover of "woods in good condition."
For all other areas (including all impervious surfaces), predevelopment calculations shall
assume ground cover of "meadow."
For regulated activities involving redevelopment, the following ground cover assumptions
shall be used:

§ 230-40. Collection and payment of tax.
Duty of employer to collect and make payment. Each employer within Uwchlan Township, as well
as each employer situated outside of Uwchlan Township but who engages in business within
Uwchlan Township, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting from each employee engaged by
the employer and performing for the employer within Uwchlan Township the tax of $52 per annum

in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned
income within Uwchlan Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification hereunder, a lump sum equal to the amount of
tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person under
this section, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax
withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the
same amount withheld for other employees. In the event that the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar
year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and Uwchlan Township
may pursue collection of the tax.
In the case of an employee who has concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides a recent pay stub from a principal
employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the
amount of the local services tax withheld, and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employer's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence.
Returns; responsibility for payment. Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a
computation of the tax on forms to be supplied to him by the Local Services Tax Collector. It is
further provided that, if the employer fails to file said return and pay said tax, whether or not he
makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to said employee, the
employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had originally
been levied against the employer. A tax return must be filed for each calendar quarter, regardless
of whether withholdings were completed or any tax liabilities exist.

Dates for determining liability and payment. Each employer shall use his employment record as of
each payroll period in the calendar year to determine from whom the tax shall be deducted. An
employer shall be required to remit quarterly payments of the tax to the Local Services Tax
Collector on or before the 30th day after the end of each quarter of a calendar year on forms
prescribed by the Local Services Tax Collector.
Self-employed individuals. Every taxpayer who is self-employed and has not filed an exemption
certificate with the Tax Collector, or whose tax for any other reason is not collected under § 230-40
of this article, shall file a return on a form prescribed by the Tax Collector and shall pay a pro-rata
share of the tax directly to the Tax Collector within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on a taxpayer for a calendar quarter shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax levied under this article for the year by four.
Persons residing outside the Township. All self-employed individuals and employers residing or
having their place of business outside the corporate limits of Uwchlan Township and engaging in
an occupation within the Township do by virtue thereof agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions of this article and the regulations promulgated hereunder with the
same force and effect as though they had their place of business in or were residents of Uwchlan
Township. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within Uwchlan Township and as an
employee of a nonresident employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a selfemployed
person, but in the event the tax is not paid, the Local Services Tax Collector shall have
the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection as hereinafter
provided.
Individuals engaged in more than one occupation.
Each employee who shall have more than one occupation within Uwchlan Township shall be
subject to the payment of this tax on his principal occupation, and his principal employer shall
deduct this tax. The principal employer shall deliver to such employee evidence of deduction.
This evidence of deduction, showing that payment having been made and when presented to
any other employer, shall be authority for such employer to not deduct this tax from the
employee's wages but to include such employee on his return by setting forth his name,
social security number and the name of the employer who deducted this tax.
In the event that an individual is engaged in more than one occupation or an occupation
which requires his working in more than one political subdivision during the calendar year, the
priority of claim to collect such local services tax shall be in the following order: first, the
political subdivision in which an individual maintains his principal office or is principally
employed; second, the political subdivision in which the individual resides and works if such a
tax is levied by that political subdivision; third, the political subdivision in which an individual is
employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the individual's home. The place of
employment shall be determined as of the day the taxpayer first becomes subject to the tax
during the calendar year.
It is the intent of this provision that no individual shall pay more than $52 in any calendar year
as a local services tax, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which such
individual may be employed within any given calendar year. In case of dispute, a proof of
payment that the tax has been paid for that calendar year shall constitute prima facie
certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
Each employer shall ensure that exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at
all times and shall furnish each new employee with an exemption certificate form at the time of
hiring and prior to the first payroll period of each year.

The Local Services Tax Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of this article and is hereby charged and empowered to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
article, including provisions for the examination of the books, accounts and payroll records of

overpayment is claimed and found to have occurred.
The Local Services Tax Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books, accounts and
payroll records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an
employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby
directed and required to give the Local Services Tax Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
Late payment; recovery. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, a penalty of 10% shall be
added to the tax, and interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction thereof shall also be added.
Where legal action is brought for the recovery of the tax, the individual or employer thereafter
shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for collection costs including attorneys' fees.
Violations and penalties. Any person who makes any false or untrue statement on any return or
record required by this article refuses inspection of his books, records or accounts in his custody
and control, fails or refuses to file any return required by this article or fails to pay the tax due shall
be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $600, for each offense, plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Township. Upon a finding of liability for
committing said violation, or permitting said violation, in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, the defendant shall pay the fine plus costs and attorneys' fees. No
judgment shall be imposed until the date of determination of a violation by a court of competent
jurisdiction. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure. It is further provided that
the action to enforce the fine and penalty herein provided may be instituted against any person in
charge of the business of any employer who has failed or refuses to file a return required by this
article.[1]

A person seeking exemption from the tax under § 230-42 must annually file an exemption
certificate with the employer and the Local Services Tax Collector. If a person claims an exemption
from the tax under § 230-42A, the exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of
the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within Uwchlan Township for the
calendar year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting to be exempt from
the tax. The exemption certificate for any exemption under § 230-42 must be in a form

to a refund of tax for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that exceed $1.
The Local Services Tax Collector is hereby charged and empowered to adopt regulations for the
processing of refund claims for overpaid local services tax consistent with 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425, as
amended (relating to refunds of overpayments), and 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426, as amended (relating to

refund within 75 days of the refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required
to remit the local services tax for the last quarter of the calendar year under § 230-40C, whichever
is later.
§ 230-44. Collection of Downingtown School District local
services tax.

garages that shall be designated from time to time by the Township. Every such garage shall submit

aerial canopy. For the purposes of this ordinance, the extent of any woodland plant community or
any part thereof shall be measured from the outermost dripline of all the trees in the community.
Woodland shall include any area where timber has been harvested within the previous three years
and/or woodland disturbance has occurred within the previous three years which would have met
the definition of woodland prior to timbering or disturbance. Woodlands do not include nursery
stock, orchards, or old fields, except where natural succession has been allowed to occur and
where most naturally occurring trees are larger than six inches dbh.
WOODLAND DISTURBANCE
Any activity which alters the existing structure of a woodland or hedgerow. Alterations include the
cutting or removal of canopy trees, subcanopy trees, understory shrubs and vines, and woody and
herbaceous woodland floor species. It also includes any activity which constitutes a land
disturbance (exposes soils, alters topography) within a woodland or hedgerow. Woodland

Article III. Plan Submission and Review Procedure
§ 301. General provisions.
The Township has adopted the procedures set forth herein which shall be observed by all applicants,
developers, and their agents.
Authority for plan approval. Final authority for approval or denial of approval of all subdivision
and land development plans shall be vested in the Township Board of Supervisors in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein. Prior to action by the Board, all plans shall be referred for
review and recommendation to the Township Planning Commission, the Township Engineer, and
such other agencies as deemed pertinent by the Board or as required by law. However, the failure
to make such referral and/or the failure by any reviewing party to review and/or make
recommendation with respect to any plan shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the
Board with respect to such plan. In addition, in the course of its review, the Township Planning
Commission may solicit review and reports from any official Township consultant or entity it
considers to be affected by the subject plan.

Plan classification. For purposes of procedure, all applications filed pursuant to this ordinance
shall be further classified as either major or minor as defined below:
Minor: Any plan providing for a lot line adjustment or rejoining of lots where no land development
is proposed, or any residential subdivision or land development application in which all of the
following apply:
No public or private street is constructed or is required to be widened;
No earthmoving activities except those incidental to construction of a single-family dwelling on
each proposed lot will take place;
No public improvement or guaranty thereof is required other than as may relate to on-lot
stormwater management systems or sewer or water lines serving an individual lot;
No more than three lots shall result from any residential subdivision;
Plans are not filed pursuant to the residential open space design option; and
No more than two minor subdivisions shall be approved over any period of time for any
original tract or parcel of ground. Any subsequent subdivision approval submission after the
two minor subdivisions are approved shall be considered major and subjected to the related
provisions herein, regardless of size or scale.
Major: Any subdivision or land development application not classified as minor as provided
above.
Overview of plan submission and review process. The following plan review steps represent the
standard approach used in Uwchlan Township. Plan contents shall be as set forth in Article IV, and
the number of plan sets to be submitted shall be as specified herein.

Major Subdivision or Land
Development
Preapplication meeting Recommended Recommended
Sketch plan Recommended Recommended
Preliminary plan Not required Required
Final plan Required Required
Recommended conceptual lot and street layout for remaining lands. When an application
includes only a portion of a landowner's entire tract, or where lands subject to application are
contiguous to an adjoining tract of the same landowner, the Planning Commission and/or the
Board of Supervisors may require the applicant to include a conceptual layout showing future
potential subdivision or land development of all the contiguous lands belonging to the landowner
to ensure that future development may be accomplished in accordance with current codes and
with appropriate access. Submission and review of the conceptual lot and street layout described
in this section does not constitute approval of the future subdivision or land development shown
thereon.
Municipalities Planning Code requirements. Preliminary and final plans shall be reviewed in
accordance with the requirements of the latest version of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (MPC) and as set forth herein.
Site access for purposes of plan review. The owner of the parcel of land to be subdivided or
developed shall, as part of initial submission in regard to the subject property, submit a written
statement granting the Uwchlan Township Board of Supervisors, its authorized agents and
representatives, and the Planning Commission the right to enter the parcel of land for the purpose
of evaluating the site and the proposed development thereof. The Township shall make a

reasonable effort to contact the applicant to notify him of the Township's scheduled site access at
least two days in advance of such site visit.
Plan review by adjacent municipalities.
The Township may solicit comments from an adjacent municipality for any subdivision or land
development plan application for tracts of land along the Township boundary, in which case
an additional plan set and accompanying documents may be required for the Township to
forward to the adjacent municipality for its comments.
The Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors will review the reports from the
adjacent municipality as part of the plan review process when comments are solicited.
However, if any adjoining municipality fails to report thereon prior to the time that the
Township Planning Commission or Board moves to make a recommendation or decision, then
the Township Planning Commission or Board, as the case may be, may officially act without
having received and considered such report.
Refiling of plans. Any plan which meets any one of the criteria below shall be considered to be
a new plan and shall be accompanied by an application, fees and all required information.
A plan which is submitted after a previous plan for the same property has been withdrawn
shall constitute a new plan.
A plan which is submitted after a plan for the same property has been approved or rejected
shall constitute a new plan, unless the plan is a final plan following preliminary plan approval.
A plan which is resubmitted during the course of plan review by the Planning Commission or
Board of Supervisors, and is deemed by either to represent a substantially altered lot layout,
road configuration, building location(s) or use, for the same land that was included in a prior
plan submission, shall constitute a new plan. Plans considered by the Township as a major
revision pursuant to the provisions of § 304.4.d(4), in the case of preliminary plans, or
§ 305.5.d(4), in the case of final plans, and starting a new ninety-day time period for formal
review and notification, may not need to resubmit an application or fees but may require new
supplemental plans or impact studies.
Township review and escrow fees. No application for preliminary or final plan review shall be
deemed to have been officially submitted until the application fee and escrow deposit, as set forth
below, shall have been paid by the applicant.
Subdivision and land development application fees (nonrefundable) and initial escrow
deposits to cover the costs for plan review and processing shall be fixed by the Board of
Supervisors by resolution. The escrowed funds shall be used to reimburse the Township for
actual expenditures incident to these processes, including but not limited to engineering,
inspection, consultant, and legal fees. Any costs incurred by the Township in excess of the
amount held in escrow shall be fully reimbursed by the applicant prior to the issuance of any
permits. Any costs not paid within the time specified by the Township shall be assessed an
interest penalty as established by the Board and may result in the suspension of reviews of
the applicant's plans. Any unexpended balance in the review escrow deposit shall become
part of the escrow deposit required by § 306 herein.
If problems arise requiring more-extensive involvement of the Township Engineer, any
resulting costs that exceed the initial escrow deposit or subsequent deposits will be assessed
against the applicant.

The following procedures are to be followed for all subdivision and land development plan applications
submitted to Uwchlan Township. The content of required plan submissions is set forth in Article IV.
Preapplication meeting. Prior to any formal plan submission, it is strongly recommended that the
applicant for any subdivision or land development approval schedule and meet the Township
Manager or the designated representative. The purpose of the preapplication meeting is to
introduce the applicant to the Township's planning objectives and applicable regulations and
procedures and to discuss the applicant's objectives.
Site visit. Applicants for subdivision or land development approval may be requested by the
Township Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors to arrange for a site visit of the property
by Township representatives that may include the Township Engineer and any other federal, state,
or county representatives or consultants as the Township deems appropriate. Applicants shall
agree to reimburse the Township for any reasonable costs charged by Township consultants in
relation to such site visit when such consultants have been requested by the Township to attend.
Applicants are encouraged to accompany Township representatives. The site visit may be
requested by the Township at any time during which a subdivision or land development application
filed in accordance with this ordinance is pending Township approval. Comments made by the
Township or its staff and consultants during the site visit shall be only advisory and are not binding
on either the Township or the applicant. It shall be understood by all parties that no formal
recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions can be made, at the site visit or during
the sketch plan process.
§ 303. Sketch plans.
Purpose and applicability. The purpose of the sketch plan, which is an optional but strongly
encouraged submission for all plans, is to afford the applicant the opportunity to consult early and
informally with the Planning Commission and the Township before submission of formal plans
(preliminary or final, as applicable) for subdivision or land development approval. The sketch plan
is an important, valuable, and highly recommended submittal that can speed the review process
and may result in lower costs for the project. It is strongly recommended that all applicants for
sketch plan review follow the preapplication procedures set forth in § 302.
Sketch plan submission and review.
The applicant shall submit seven copies of the sketch plan application to the Township.
Submitted applications shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements contained in
§ 401 hereof. Where submitted, the sketch plan and supporting materials shall be filed with
the Township at least the Friday prior to the Planning Commission meeting at which they are
to be discussed.
Where feasible, and at the request of the Township upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, the sketch plan also may be submitted to the Township electronically in
the format specified by the Township Engineer.
Copies of the sketch plan application will be distributed by the Township to the Township
Planning Commission and Township Engineer.
At the next regularly scheduled public meeting subsequent to submission in accordance with
§ 303.2.a above, the applicant shall present the sketch plan and supporting materials to the
Township Planning Commission.
The Township Planning Commission will review the sketch plan. As a result of its review, the
Planning Commission may offer comment to the applicant of the extent to which the proposed
subdivision or land development conforms to the relevant Township ordinances, to Township
planning, design and historic preservation objectives, and to environmentally responsible
design, and may suggest plan modifications.

Prior to making recommendations on the proposed sketch plan, the Planning Commission
may request the preliminary input of the Township Engineer or planning consultant and other
Township commissions or committees, where relevant, and may hear comments from
surrounding or affected landowners present at its public meeting(s). All planning and
engineering review fees shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
All comments and recommendations made by Township representatives in regard to sketch
plan review are nonbinding. No comment or recommendation, nor the failure of the Planning
Commission or any Township representative to proceed or act in accordance with this section,
shall be deemed to be a decision with respect to any subdivision or land development plan or
to vest any rights in the applicant.
§ 304. Preliminary plans.
Purpose and applicability.
Except as provided in § 304.1.a, all applicants for major subdivision or land development
approval shall submit a preliminary plan application. Applicants for minor subdivision or land
development approval are not required to submit a preliminary plan application but may
proceed with final plan application.
[Amended 10-14-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-02]
All applicants for preliminary plan approval are recommended to follow the preapplication
procedures set forth in § 302, and submit a sketch plan as set forth in § 303, prior to formal
submission of a preliminary plan application. Applicants who choose to submit preliminary
plans without taking advantage of preapplication and sketch plan options may incur added
engineering expenses. Evaluation of planning design and ordinance issues occurring during
preapplication and sketch plan review can facilitate the preliminary and final plan review
processes by addressing a number of issues at an early stage during plan preparation.
Preliminary plan applications shall conform to any recommendations made during sketch plan
review and all information requirements and procedures set forth herein.
An applicant may request that the Board permit the filing of a combined preliminary/final
application for major subdivision or land development, subject to the following requirements:
[Added 10-14-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-02]
The applicant shall schedule and attend a preapplication meeting as described in § 302.1
hereof. The Township Manager and his/her designees shall provide a recommendation to
the applicant regarding the applicant's proposal to submit a combined preliminary/final
application.
If the applicant intends to proceed with submission of a preliminary/final application, the
applicant shall prepare and file a sketch plan in accordance with the procedures and
requirements of § 401 hereof and the requirements of §§ 402.1 and 402.2.c applicable to
a preliminary plan.
The sketch plan shall be reviewed in accordance with § 303.2 hereof. The sketch plan
shall not be considered an official filing with the Township and shall not be subject to the
requirements of § 508 of the Municipalities Planning Code[1] and §§ 304.4.a or 305.5.e(1)
hereof.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10508.
The applicant shall submit filing, review and escrow fees with the sketch plan in
accordance with the Township fee schedule.

recommended by the Planning Commission, all of the requirements of this § 304.1.d
have been complied with, and the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board
that the filing of a preliminary/final application will fulfill all the requirements of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, and will not be contrary to the public
interest and the purpose and intent of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
The preliminary/final application and plan shall comply with all of the requirements for

plan is first to be discussed.
If requested by the Township, plans in the preliminary plan application also shall be submitted
to the Township electronically in the format specified by the Township Engineer.
Upon receipt of the preliminary plan application, the Township shall determine whether the
submission is administratively complete. To be considered administratively complete, all of the
documentation required by this ordinance shall be included with the application and required
escrow and review fees shall be paid to the Township in accordance with the municipal fee
schedule, along with any required fees for Chester County Planning Commission review.
The date upon which a preliminary plan application is determined to be administratively
complete shall be considered the date of filing, and on that date the submission shall be
accepted for review. If a preliminary plan application is determined not to be administratively
complete, it shall be returned to the applicant with a specific indication of the missing
materials or fees which rendered it incomplete.
Distribution of preliminary plans. The Township will forward copies of the preliminary plan to the
Township Planning Commission and one copy of the preliminary plan and required supporting
information and materials to the Township Engineer. The Township will file the preliminary plan
and accompanying documentation, as appropriate, with the Chester County Planning
Commission, appropriate emergency services representatives, and other agencies as deemed
appropriate and requested by the Township.
Review of the preliminary plan and rendering of decision.
Official review period. The Board of Supervisors shall render a decision in regard to the

Prior to communicating its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding any
preliminary plan application, the Commission may request the input and/or may review
the written comments or testimony of any of the Township Engineer or consultants or
other agencies involved in the review of the subject plan as provided in § 304.4.b and c
above; it may receive comments from surrounding or affected landowners; and it may
also conduct a site visit(s) to facilitate its review.
During the course of the Planning Commission's review of the preliminary plan and prior
to any action by the Board within the required ninety-day period, the preliminary plan may
be revised by the applicant. Such plans shall note the dates of any revisions. The revised
plans shall be submitted to the Township not later than the Friday prior to the regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. The revised plan will be distributed by
the Township as required by § 304.3.
Except where an extension of time is requested in writing by the applicant, the Planning
Commission shall communicate its comments and recommendations to the Board of
Supervisors by the time of the last scheduled meeting of the Board of Supervisors prior to
the expiration of the ninety-day review period. The communication from the Planning
Commission to the Board of Supervisors may include any recommended conditions of
approval and may cite specific sections of the ordinance or other reasons relied upon for
the Planning Commission's recommendations. Failure of the Planning Commission to
communicate its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors within the prescribed time
frame shall not affect the status of the preliminary plan application nor cause any
extension of the applicable review period.
Review and decision by the Board of Supervisors.
Prior to the expiration of the ninety-day review period, as set forth above, unless an
extension of time is requested in writing by the applicant, the Board of Supervisors shall
render a decision in regard to the preliminary plan application.
The decision shall be in writing and shall be communicated to the applicant
personally or be mailed via registered or certified mail to him at his last known
address not later than 15 days following the decision.
When the application is not approved as filed, the decision shall specify the defects
in the application, shall describe requirements which have not been met, and shall
cite the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.
When the application is approved with conditions, and upon the applicant's receipt
and review of such conditions, the applicant shall inform the Township in writing that
the conditions imposed by the Board of Supervisors and set forth in the approval
communication are accepted, or shall appeal the conditions within 30 days of the
date of approval. Failure to so accept or appeal any condition(s) shall void the plan
approval, and the subject preliminary plan application shall be considered denied.
The Board of Supervisors may require that final plan application for the subject property
be submitted within 12 months of the date of preliminary plan approval. In such case, the
applicant may request an extension beyond the 12 months subject to approval by the
Board of Supervisors.
Upon approval of the preliminary plan application, the Board of Supervisors will designate
one copy of the preliminary plan as the official copy. This copy shall include all necessary
corrections as required by the Board of Supervisors. It will be retained in the Township
files.
Approval of the preliminary plan shall not constitute approval of the final plan or authorize
the sale of lots or construction of buildings.

§ 305. Final plans.
Purpose. The purpose of the final plan application for subdivision or land development is to
assure full compliance with this ordinance, with applicable zoning provisions and with all other
applicable laws and regulations prior to formal recording of all relevant planning documents and
land records and to ensure long-term proper functioning, maintenance and funding for all
proposed improvements.
Applicability. Upon submission of any final plan application, the Township shall determine
whether the plan is a major or minor plan submission, as defined in § 301.2, and whether the
submitted plans are administratively complete as provided in § 305.3.
If the application is a major plan submission, but no preliminary plan application has
previously been submitted and approved, the application shall be returned to the applicant or,
upon the request of the applicant, submitted as a preliminary plan in accordance with § 304
hereof.
If the application is a major plan submission following a preliminary plan application previously
submitted and approved, or if the application is a minor plan submission, the application shall
be retained by the Township for review in accordance with this section.
For a major plan application, the final plan shall conform to the terms of the approved
preliminary plan.
For a major plan application, the Board of Supervisors may permit submission of the final plan
in sections, consistent with Section 508 of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).[1]
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10508.
Final plan applications shall conform to any conditions in any applicable order or approval for
a conditional use, special exception or zoning variance.
Where preliminary plan approval includes a condition imposed by the Board of Supervisors
requiring the final plan to be filed within one year of the date of preliminary plan approval [see
§ 304.4.e(2)], failure of an applicant to make timely submission of such final plan (within one
year of preliminary plan approval) shall render void the preliminary plan approval. Applicants
with final plans subject to such a filing deadline condition may request from the Board of
Supervisors a reasonable extension of the one-year time limit for filing when good cause can
be shown. Otherwise, the applicant shall be required to file a new application for preliminary
plan approval.
Final plan submission and acceptance for review.
The final plan application shall include all information in § 403. Steps which have been
satisfactorily completed during the preapplication, sketch plan, or preliminary plan review
stages, as applicable, and that meet applicable criteria for final plan submission, need not be
repeated. Submitted plans and accompanying documentation shall be clearly marked "Final
Plans."
The applicant shall submit one copy of the final plan application, 10 copies of the final plan
sets, and two copies of all required supporting information and materials to the Township. The
final plan application shall be submitted to the Township at least the Friday prior to the
regularly scheduled Board of Supervisors meeting at which the final plan is first to be

Review by the Township Planning Commission.
The Township Planning Commission will, at its regularly scheduled public meetings,
review the final plan application for consistency with any applicable preliminary plan
approval and in accordance with this ordinance and other applicable ordinances, with any
conditions of approval contained in any applicable order or approval of any conditional
use, special exception, or zoning variance, with the results of any relevant sketch plan
review or discussion, and in consideration of the comments submitted by the Township
Engineer and any other Township consultants, where applicable.
The applicant or designated representative should be present at such meeting. The
Commission shall advise the applicant of the extent to which the proposed subdivision or
land development conforms to the relevant standards of this ordinance and the Uwchlan
Township Zoning Ordinance, any conditions of approval contained in any applicable order
or approval of any conditional use, special exception, or zoning variance, the need for or
acceptability of any waivers or modifications of design standards contained herein, and
any suggested plan modifications that would increase the subdivision's or land
development's degree of conformance in order to obtain a Planning Commission
recommendation of approval.

final plan application, the Planning Commission may request the input and/or may review
the written comments or testimony of any of the Township's planning and engineering
consultants or other agencies involved in the review of the subject plan as provided in
§ 305.5.b and c above, and it may conduct a site visit(s) to facilitate its review.
During the course of the Planning Commission's review of the final plan and prior to any
action by the Board within the required ninety-day period, the final plan may be revised
by the applicant. Such plans shall note the dates of any revisions. The revised plans shall
be submitted to the Township not later than the Friday prior to the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission. The revised plan shall be distributed by the
Township as required by § 305.4.
Except where an extension of time is requested in writing by the applicant, the Planning
Commission shall communicate its comments and recommendations to the Board of
Supervisors by the time of the last scheduled meeting of the Board prior to the expiration
of the ninety-day review period. The communication from the Planning Commission to
the Board of Supervisors may include any recommended conditions of approval and may
cite specific sections of the ordinance or other reasons relied upon for the Commission's
recommendations. Failure of the Planning Commission to communicate its
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors within the prescribed time frame shall not
affect the status of the final plan application nor cause any extension of the applicable
review period.

Prior to the expiration of the ninety-day review period, as set forth above, unless an
extension of time is requested in writing by the applicant, the Board of Supervisors shall
render a decision in regard to the final plan application.
The Board of Supervisors may specify conditions, changes, modifications, or additions to
the application which the Board deems necessary.

All final plan approval shall be subject to the following conditions, as applicable:
The applicant shall execute a written agreement, in accordance with § 801 herein,
agreeing to install all the improvements as required by this ordinance and all
regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
The applicant shall also provide a performance guaranty in accordance with § 801
herein.
The applicant shall agree, if requested, to tender a deed of dedication to the
Township for such roads, easements for sanitary sewers, water lines, or storm
sewers, public open space(s) and public improvements, including stormwater basins,
road paving, sidewalks, trails, shade trees, roadscape amenities, water mains, any
fire hydrants, sanitary and storm sewers, as may be required for the promotion of the
public welfare, after all said improvements are completed and such completion is
certified as satisfactory by the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors may
require that the applicant supply a title insurance certificate or policy (in such amount
as the Township shall reasonably require) from a reputable company before any
property is accepted by the Township.
The applicant shall have applied for all required permits from agencies having
jurisdiction over ancillary development, such as the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT), the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (PADEP), the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the CCHD.
No plan which proposes access onto a road under the jurisdiction of PennDOT shall
be finally approved unless the plan contains a notice that a highway access permit is
required therefor pursuant to Section 420 of Act 428, known as the "State Highway
Law,"[2] before access to a state road is permitted.
Editor's Note: See 36 P.S. § 670-101 et seq.
The decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be in writing and shall be communicated
to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last known address not later than 15
days following the decision.
When the application is not approved as filed, the decision shall specify the defects
in the application, describe requirements which have not been met and shall cite the
provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.
When the application is approved with conditions (i.e., but not as filed), the decision
shall contingently comply with § 305.5.e(4)(a) above. The applicant shall inform the
Township in writing within 30 days of the date of such approval whether the
condition(s) imposed by the Board of Supervisors are acceptable or not to the
applicant. Failure to so timely inform the Township of the applicant's acceptance of
such condition(s) shall void the plan approval, and the subject final plan shall be
deemed denied for the reasons so specified in such decision.
Application for any subsequent permit (e.g., building permit) or initiation of any
construction in accordance with the approved plan prior to the passage of 30 days of
its approval shall constitute acceptance of any conditions so imposed upon the final
plan approval.
Approved final plan.
Upon approval of the final plan application, the Board of Supervisors will designate one
copy of the final plan as the official copy. This copy shall include all necessary corrections
as finally approved by the Board, shall be certified by the applicant's appropriate

professional(s) and shall be endorsed by signature of the applicant and Board of

days at the office of the Chester County Recorder of Deeds, consistent with the
provisions of Section 513(a) of the MPC.[3]
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10513.
The office of the Chester County Recorder of Deeds will retain three signed and
recorded copies.
One recorded copy will be returned to the applicant.
One signed and recorded copy shall be returned to the Township, together with one
copy of all supporting materials that were recorded with the plan.
Where specifically requested by the Township, the approved final plan also shall be
submitted to the Township electronically in the format specified by the Township
Engineer.
The Township may offer a mediation option as an aid in completing proceedings authorized by
this section. In exercising such an option, the Township and mediating parties shall meet the
stipulations and follow the procedures set forth in Article IX of the MPC.
§ 306. Guarantee of installation of improvements.
Prior to final approval of the final plan, the subdivider shall guarantee the installation of all required
improvements by one of the following methods:
By installing the improvements required by Article VI of this Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer and the Board of Supervisors and
obtaining a certificate from the Township Engineer that all improvements have been installed in
accordance with the standards and requirements contained in this ordinance or other
requirements of the Township.
In lieu of completing all of the improvements required as a condition for the final plan approval,
including improvements or fees required pursuant to this section, the subdivider or developer shall
post a performance guaranty with the Township in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such
improvements or common amenities, including, but not limited to, roads, stormwater detention
and/or retention basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be required.
When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the Board of Supervisors shall
furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan
contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan shall not be
signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or
letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security
agreement is not executed within 90 days, unless a written extension is granted by the Board of
Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at
the request of the developer.
The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the required improvements
shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date
8/17/2020 Township of Uwchlan, PA Ecode360

scheduled for completion by the developer. Said amount may be adjusted annually by the
Township by comparing the actual cost of improvements which have been completed and the
estimated cost of the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th
day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, any additional security shall be posted by the developer in order
to assure that the financial security equals 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
The performance guaranty may be either a performance bond with corporate surety or other
security acceptable to the Board of Supervisors. Federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending
institutions or bonding companies must be authorized to conduct business within the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Performance guaranties shall be submitted in a form and with a
surety approved by the Township Solicitor guaranteeing the construction and installation of all
improvements within a stated period, which shall not be longer than three years from the date of
final subdivision or land development approval. However, upon written application signed by both
the obligor and the surety of the performance guaranty, in a form approved by the Township
Solicitor, the Board of Supervisors may, at its discretion, extend said period by not more than three
additional years, but, in any event, the Township shall still be entitled to adjust said security on an
annual basis.
The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements submitted by the developer or subdivider and prepared
by a professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such engineer
to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township's Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the developer
or subdivider and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township and the developer or subdivider. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the
final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, the fees for the services for said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the subdivider or developer.
If the applicant or developer requires more than one year from the date of posting financial
security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting the financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements as established on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period
by using the above procedure.
In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Board of Supervisors
may authorize the submission of final plans by sections or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the development.
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request the Board of Supervisors body to release or authorize the release, from time
to time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of
Supervisors, and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within
which to allow the Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such
portion of the work upon the improvements has been competed in accordance with the approved
plan. Upon such certification, the Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the bonding
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the
release of funds as requested. The Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of

completion and certification by the Township Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated
cost of the aforesaid improvements.
The amount of the performance guaranty may be reduced by the Board of Supervisors by
resolution as and when portions of the required improvements have been installed as detailed in
§ 306.9 above. In the event of default, the obligor and surety shall be liable thereon to the
Township for the cost of the improvements or parts thereof not installed. Upon receipt of the
proceeds thereof, the Township shall install the improvements. If cost of the improvements
exceeds the amount of the performance guaranty, then the subdivider shall be liable for the
amount in excess which the Township has actually expended for such improvements. In case the
amount of the performance guaranty exceeds the actual cost of improvements made, the
Township shall return the unused sum to the surety or the person who has paid or deposited the
performance guaranty.
If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or facilities related thereto,
are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility
or municipal authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to assure proper
completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations of the
controlling public utility or municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial security
as otherwise required by this section.
If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements required as a
condition for the final plan approval plat as set forth in this section, the Township shall not
condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of
improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon
actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final plan. Moreover, if said
financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected
shall not be withheld following: the improvement of the streets providing access to and from
existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question, if such
improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
§ 307. Release from performance guaranty.
When the subdivider has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, the
subdivider shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township
Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and
authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Board of Supervisors and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the subdivider by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made
and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization
from the Board of Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection
of said improvements, either in whole or in part; and if said improvements, or any portion thereof,
shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
The Board of Supervisors, within 15 days of receipt of the Engineer's report, shall notify the
subdivider in writing, by certified or registered mail, of its action.
If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation
provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved, and the
developer shall be released from all liability pursuant to his performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.

If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Board
of Supervisors, the subdivider shall proceed to complete the same; and, upon completion, the
same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
Before the release of any performance guaranty, the subdivider shall, upon completion of all
improvements, submit one set of reproducible as-built drawings to the Township Engineer and one
copy of the subdivision plat at a scale of one inch equals 600 feet.
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the developer's right to contest or
question, by legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the
Township Engineer.
Where herein reference is made to the Township Engineer, he/she shall be a duly registered
professional engineer employed by the Township or engaged as a consultant thereto.
The Township may prescribe that the applicant shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable
and necessary expense incurred in connection with the inspection of improvements. The applicant
shall not be required to reimburse the Board Supervisors for any inspection which is duplicative of
inspections conducted by other governmental agencies or public utilities. The burden of proving
that any inspection is duplicative shall be upon the objecting applicant. Such reimbursement shall
be based upon a schedule established by ordinance or resolution. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Township's
professional consultant for work performed for similar services in the community, but in no event
shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional consultant to the Township for
comparable services when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
The Board of Supervisors shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill showing the work
performed in connection with the inspection of improvements performed, identifying the
person performing the services and the time and date spent for each task. In the event the
applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection with the inspection of
improvements, the applicant shall, no later than 30 days after the date of transmittal of a bill
for inspection services, notify the Township and the Township's professional consultant that
such inspection expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary and shall explain the
basis of his/her objections to the fees charged, in which case the Township shall not delay or
disapprove a request for release of financial security, a subdivision or land development
application or any approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's dispute of
inspection expenses. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within 30 days shall be a waiver
of the applicant's right to arbitration of that bill under this section.
Subsequent to the final release of financial security for completion of improvements for a
subdivision or land development, or any phase thereof, the professional consultant shall
submit to the Board of Supervisors a bill for inspection services, specifically designated as a
final bill. The final bill shall include inspection fees incurred through the release of financial
security.
If, the professional consultant and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses
which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant shall have the right, within 45 days of
the transmittal of the final bill or supplement to the final bill to the applicant, to request the
appointment of another professional consultant to serve as an arbitrator. The applicant and
professional consultant whose fees are being challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint
another professional consultant to review any bills the applicant has disputed and which
remain unresolved and make a determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary. The arbitrator shall be of the same profession as the professional consultant
whose fees are being challenged.
The arbitrator so appointed shall hear such evidence and review such documentation as the
arbitrator, in his or her sole opinion, deems necessary and shall render a decision no later
than 50 days after the date of appointment. Based on the decision of the arbitrator, the

applicant or the professional consultant whose fees were challenged shall be required to pay
any amounts necessary to implement the decision within 60 days. In the event the Township
has paid the professional consultant an amount in excess of the amount determined to be
reasonable and necessary, the professional consultant shall, within 60 days, reimburse the
excess payment.
In the event that the Township's professional consultant and applicant cannot agree upon the
arbitrator to be appointed within 20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, then,
upon application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the
judicial district in which the municipality is located (or if at the time there be no President
Judge, then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such arbitrator, who, in that
case, shall be neither the Township's professional consultant nor any professional consultant
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the Township or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the applicant if the review fee charged is sustained
by the arbitrator; otherwise it shall be divided equally between the parties. If the disputed fees
are found to be excessive by more than $5,000, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to
assess the arbitration fee in whole or in part against either the applicant or the professional
consultant. The Board of Supervisors and the consultant whose fees are the subject of the
dispute shall be parties to the proceeding.
§ 308. Dedication; maintenance guaranty.
All streets, parks or other improvements shown on the subdivision plan, recorded or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be private until such time as the same have been offered for dedication to the
Township and accepted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements
following completion, the Board of Supervisors may require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of the
same type as otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such improvements as
approved by the Township Solicitor and Board of Supervisors, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.

conditional use approval where a traffic analysis was submitted within two years before the
date that a preliminary plan was filed, except upon request of the Township, when, in the
opinion of the Township traffic consultant, traffic conditions have significantly changed to
warrant a new study.
Purpose. The purpose of the study is to identify any traffic problems likely to result from the
proposed development in relation to ingress/egress, road capacities, off-site traffic flow, public
transportation, and pedestrian and other nonvehicular circulation.
Contents.
The contents of the study shall be such as to enable the Board of Supervisors to assess the
likely impacts of the proposed development on the existing transportation network of the
Township and surrounding areas.
The study shall be prepared in accordance with the Institute of Transportation Engineers'
(ITE) recommended practice "Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development,"
current edition, FHWA Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, current edition, and

Occupancy Permit Guidelines), current editions.
The study shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, an analysis of expected traffic
generation to, from, and upon surrounding roads within a radius of two miles from the
proposed development site, particularly showing a.m. and p.m. peak hours of existing traffic
flow during a normal business day, in comparison with that which is anticipated after the
proposed development is fully completed and, if applicable, upon the completion of each
stage. Estimated peak-hour trip generation shall be based on procedures established in the
most-recent edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Existing traffic flows shall be based on
actual counts; if these cannot be obtained, an alternative source, subjected to review and
approval by the Township traffic consultant, may be used.
The Township Engineer and/or Township traffic consultant shall review the methodology,
assumptions, findings, and recommendations of the study and report his or her conclusions to
the Planning Commission and to the Board of Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation from the Township Engineer and/or
Township traffic consultant, may impose upon the applicant additional on-site improvements
deemed necessary to accommodate impacts of the proposed development and require a fee
as prescribed within the Uwchlan Township Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance, No. 92-7
and 2009-09, as amended, enacted pursuant to the MPC, for off-site public transportation
capital improvements deemed necessary to accommodate impacts of the proposed
development.
§ 408. Fiscal impact study.
With respect to any proposed development consisting of five residential dwelling units or lots or
5,000 square feet of gross floor area to be devoted to nonresidential uses, the preliminary plan
submission shall be accompanied by a fiscal impact statement reporting the results of a study of
the fiscal impact of the proposed development on the Township of Uwchlan performed by a
qualified professional and projecting the primary costs that will be incurred by the Township and
the immediate revenues that will be generated to the Township as a consequence of the proposed
subdivision or land development. The fiscal impact study and analysis shall employ the per capita
multiplier method in the case of proposed residential development and the case study method in
the case of proposed nonresidential development, as described in the most-recent edition of the
Practitioner's Guide to Fiscal Impact Analysis published by the Center for Urban Policy Research.
Demographic information by housing type, average expenditures, including budgetary information
and operating costs, and estimates of excess or deficient service capacity and expected local
service responses, if available, for use in the fiscal impact analysis may be obtained from the
Township staff. Any demonstrated adverse fiscal impact shall be borne by the developer in the
form of some combination of contributions, payments in lieu of taxes, and/or the provision of offsite
public improvements.
In lieu of the submission of a fiscal impact study as described in this section, a developer may
submit a written undertaking, in a form satisfactory to the Township Solicitor, to make an
unrestricted contribution to the Township at the time of application for building permits necessary
to commence construction of the proposed development and in an amount promulgated from time
to time by resolution of the Board.
The contributions and payments described in §§ 408.1 and 408.2 above shall be in addition to
and shall not be offset by any voluntary contributions or donations of the developer; on-site public
or quasi-public improvements, including without limitation open space lands and active or passive
recreation facilities, utilities and utility easements, and public or private roads; or improvements,
whether on- or off-site, necessary to implementation of the development proposal, including

Clear sight triangles of 250 feet shall be provided for all intersections with collector or
major streets.
Clear sight triangles for intersection with major streets shall be in accordance with
minimum standards of PennDOT.
Wherever a portion of the line of such triangles occurs behind (i.e., from the street) the
building reserve (setback) line, such portion shall be shown on the final plan of the subdivision
and shall be considered a building setback (reserve) line.
Cul-de-sac streets.
Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac streets or designed for future
access to adjoining properties.
Any temporarily dead-ended street shall be provided with a temporary all-weather turnaround
within the subdivision, and the use of such turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public until
such time as the street is extended.
Cul-de-sac streets, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed 750 feet in length for lots
containing one acre or more and shall not be more than 500 feet in length for lots containing
less than one acre. In any case, the minimum length of a cul-de-sac street shall be 250 feet.
Both of these measurements shall be taken from the back curbline of the bulb of the cul-desac
to the nearest curbline of the abutting street. No cul-de-sac street shall have access from
another cul-de-sac street.
Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround right-of-way shall
be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with sufficient additional width provided along the
boundary line to permit extension of the street at full width.
All cul-de-sac streets, whether permanently or temporarily designed as such, shall be
provided at the closed end with a fully paved turnaround. The minimum radius of the
pavement edge or curbline shall be 40 feet, and the minimum radius of the right-of-way line
shall be 50 feet.
Drainage of cul-de-sac streets shall preferably be toward the open end. If drainage is toward
the closed end, it shall be conducted away in an underground storm sewer.
The center-line grade on a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed 7%, and the grade of the
diameter of the turnaround shall not exceed 5%.
On a cul-de-sac street, no part of a fifth lot and no more than four lots may have any frontage
or driveway on the circumference of the turnaround or its reverse radius. Driveways that front
on a cul-de-sac shall be located on the preliminary plan. Driveways shall be placed so as to
facilitate snow removal.
No parking shall be permitted in the turnaround.
All non-through streets shall be provided with an authorized sign stating that no outlet exists.
For any cul-de-sac that serves 10 lots or fewer, the Board of Supervisors may approve a
pavement width of not less than 24 feet with a minimum twenty-four-foot-wide street subbase
and base course. It must be shown that the cul-de-sac will never be extended.
If a cul-de-sac is to be extended in the future, a Type II barricade or other approved structure
must be erected at the end of the cul-de-sac.

Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named
shall bear the names of the existing streets.
In no case shall the name of a proposed street be the same as or similar to an existing street
name in the Township and in the same postal district, irrespective of the use of the suffixes for
street, road, avenue, boulevard, driveway, place, court, lane, etc.
All street names and numbers shall be subject to the approval of the Township.
Service streets (alleys).
Service streets may be permitted, provided that the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory
to the Township Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors of the need for such service
streets.
No part of any dwelling, garage or other structure shall be located within five feet of the rightof-
way of a service street.
Dead-end service streets shall be avoided; but where this proves impossible, dead-end
service streets shall terminate with a paved circular turnaround with a minimum radius to the
outer pavement edge (curbline) of 50 feet.
Service street intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where
necessary corners shall be rounded as required in § 502.8.f and deflections in alignment in
excess of 5° shall be made by horizontal curves.
Driveways.
Private driveways on corner lots shall be located at least 40 feet from the point of intersection
of the nearest street right-of-way lines.
In order to provide a safe and convenient means of access, grades on private driveways shall
not exceed 14%. Entrances should be rounded at a minimum radius of five feet or should
have a flare construction that is equivalent to this radius at the point of intersection with the
cartway edge (curbline).
All private driveways shall be paved with a minimum of two inches of bituminous material or
the equivalent and have a base consisting of a minimum of six inches of stone. The driveway
entrance from the street shall be installed as to permit the uninterrupted flow of stormwater
within the road shoulder area through either a pipe or a swale situation.
The 14% maximum driveway slope shall be delineated to include the following criteria:
A minimum driveway slope of 1% is required.
The area of the driveway within the street right-of-way shall not exceed 5% in grade.
The leveling area at the garage or parking area shall not exceed 4%.
No portion of the driveway shall exceed 14%.
No building permit for a structure involving a driveway shall be issued until an engineered
profile is submitted for review and approval. In the case of a lot where it seems evident
that there is no slope problem through satisfactory Township inspection of grade stakes
showing finished road grade and first-floor elevation staked by an engineer or land
surveyor, there is no need to submit such a profile.
Where it is physically impossible or impractical to meet the 14% maximum grade, a
waiver may be considered up to a maximum of 20% as long as the applicant can supply

§ 503. Blocks.
Layout. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
Provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed.
Zoning requirements.
Topography.
Requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including the
reduction of intersections with major streets.
Length.
Blocks shall have a maximum length of 1,600 feet and a minimum length of 500 feet;
provided, however, that the Township Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors may
increase the maximum and/or decrease the minimum lengths of blocks if, in the opinion of
either body, topography of the land in question and/or surface water drainage conditions
warrant such a change.
In the design of blocks longer than 1,000 feet, special consideration shall be given to the
requirements of satisfactory fire protection.
Where practicable, blocks along major and collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet
long.
Crosswalks and sidewalks.
Crosswalks shall be required wherever necessary to facilitate pedestrian circulation and to
give access to community facilities.
Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all existing and proposed streets, within parking
areas, and, where necessary for safety and convenience, to establish pedestrian connections
to parking areas and green spaces or through blocks.
Maintenance of sidewalks and curbs, whether located within the public street right-of-way or
not, is the responsibility of the owner of the property directly adjacent to the sidewalk.
Sidewalks which are damaged or deteriorating and present a hazard to public safety shall be
repaired at the owner's expense. A note shall be added to the record plan indicating the
sidewalk maintenance responsibilities.
At the discretion of the Township, a system of bicycle, equestrian, and/or pedestrian trails for
public use generally may be established and secured by dedication or easement. These trails
may be required in any subdivision or land development.
Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the standards of § 602.3 of this ordinance.

Depth. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two tiers of lots, except
where prevented by the size, topographical conditions or other inherent conditions of the property,
in which case the Township Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors may approve a single
tier of lots.
Commercial and industrial blocks. Blocks in commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design detailed above as required by the nature of the use. In all cases, however,
adequate provision shall be made for off-street parking and loading areas as well as for traffic
circulation and parking for employees and customers.
§ 504. Lots and parcels.
General standards.
Insofar as practical, side lot lines should be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to
curved street lines.
Where feasible, lot lines should follow Township boundaries rather than cross them in order to
avoid jurisdictional problems.
Generally, the depth of residential lots should be not less than one nor more than 2 1/2 times
their width.
Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall be adequate for the use
proposed and sufficient to provide satisfactory space for on-site parking, loading and
unloading, setbacks, landscaping, etc.
If, after subdividing, there exist remnants of land, they shall be either:
Incorporated in existing or proposed lots; or
Legally dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the Township.
Lot frontage.
All lots shall front on a public street, existing or proposed, or on a private street if it meets the
requirements of this ordinance.
Double- or reverse-frontage lots shall be avoided except where required to provide separation
of residential development from major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography or orientation.
All residential reverse-frontage lots shall have a rear yard with a minimum depth of 75 feet,
measured in the shortest distance from the proposed dwelling unit to the ultimate right-of-way,
and shall have within such rear yard and immediately adjacent to the right-of-way a planting
screen easement of at least 10 feet in width, across which there shall be no right of access.
Lot size. Lot dimensions and areas shall not be less than specified by the provisions of the
Uwchlan Township Zoning Ordinance and shall further conform to Title 25, Chapter 17, Rules and
Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and § 506 of this
ordinance.
§ 505. Sanitary sewage disposal.

install sewer lines, including lateral connections, as may be necessary to provide adequate service
to each lot when connection with the sewer system is made. The sewer lines shall be suitably
capped at the limits of the subdivision, and the laterals shall be capped at the street right-of-way
line. When capped sewers are provided, on-site disposal facilities shall also be provided. Design
of capped sewer system shall be subject to approval by the Uwchlan Township Municipal Authority
(UTMA).
Sanitary sewers shall be designed and constructed in strict accordance with Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection standards and UTMA specifications. A copy of the
approval of such system shall be submitted with the final plan.
Sanitary sewers shall not be used to carry stormwater.
All lots which cannot be connected to a public or community sanitary sewage disposal system in
operation at the time of construction of a principal building shall be provided with an on-site
sanitary sewage disposal system meeting the design standards of Title 25, Chapter 73, Rules and
Regulations of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and Township standards.
If on-site sanitary sewage disposal facilities are to be utilized, the Township Planning
Commission may require that the subdivider submit a feasibility report. Such report shall compare
the cost of providing on-site facilities and the cost of public sanitary sewer system with a
temporary sewage treatment plant. Based on the analysis of this report, the UTMA may require
the installation of a public sanitary sewer system.
Where on-site sanitary sewage facilities are to be utilized, each lot so served shall be of a size
and shape to accommodate the necessary length of tile fields at a safe distance from, and at a
lower elevation than, the proposed building(s) in accordance with Township and state regulations
and shall be so plotted.
The proposed method of sanitary sewage disposal shall be in accordance with the Township's
officially adopted Act 537 Sewage Facilities Plan.
When, in accord with Title 25, Chapter 71, Section 71.16, Rules and Regulations of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the necessity for an Act 537 sewage
facilities plan revision is determined, the procedure set forth in § 71.15 through § 71.17 of those
Rules and Regulations shall be followed.
§ 506. Soil percolation test requirements.
Soil percolation tests shall be performed for all subdivisions wherein building(s) at the time of
construction will not be connected to a public or community sanitary sewage disposal system in

Public open spaces.
In reviewing subdivision and land development plans, the Township Planning Commission
and Board of Supervisors will consider whether community facilities in the area are adequate
to serve the needs of the additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision or land
development and shall make such report thereon as they deem necessary in the public
interest.
Subdividers and the Township Planning Commission shall give consideration to providing
facilities or reserving areas for facilities normally required in residential neighborhoods,
including libraries, public buildings, parks, playgrounds and playfields. Areas provided or
reserved for such community facilities shall be adequate to provide for building sites,
landscaping and off-street parking as appropriate to the use proposed and shall be suitably
prepared for this end use at the expense of the subdivider. Prior to the preparation of plans,
subdividers of large tracts should review with the Township Planning Commission the
minimum standards for various community facilities applicable to the tract being subdivided.
The subdivider shall provide suitable open space for parks, playgrounds and other recreation
uses. Due consideration shall be given to preservation of natural features such as mature
trees, woods, waterways and historic areas.
Open space and recreation area in every subdivision shall meet minimum standards for parks
and recreation established by the National Recreation and Park Association, or as set forth
below for the estimated population of the subdivision. The following minimum land area shall
be provided within the subdivision, or, when such park and open spaces should more logically
be located outside the subdivision, sufficient money shall be escrowed to purchase land
and/or facilities at an appropriate location.
Where the residential open space option or other land development option requiring open
space is not proposed, the following applies:

In accord with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order, all electric distribution lines
are required to be installed underground in residential developments of five or more family
units. This also applies to mobile home parks, apartment houses and townhouses. In
compliance with these regulations and with the cooperation of local utility companies, the
following procedure will be followed in reviewing plans subject to underground electric
service:
Upon filing of a preliminary plan for review, the subdivider will forward a copy to the
appropriate utility company if the development would fall subject to the order. This would
apprise the utility company of the project status and indicate that the subdivider would be
contacting the utility in the near future.
Upon receipt and review of preliminary plans, the subdivider is directed to contact the
utility company and secure an approval of plans for the underground electric system.
Receipt of a letter from the utility company indicating receipt of plans will be required prior
to Township endorsement of any plan for recording. The responsibility for securing this
approval and coordinating the plan with the utility company would be the subdivider's or
his representative's.
Easements with a minimum width of 30 feet shall be provided for poles, wires, conduits, storm
and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains and/or other utility lines intended to service
the abutting lots. No structures or trees shall be placed within such easements.
Easements shall be centered on or adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
There shall be a minimum distance of 50 feet, measured in the shortest distance, between
any proposed dwelling unit and any petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas
transmission line which traverses the subdivision or land development.
Subdividers are urged to avail themselves of the services provided by the various public utility
companies in determining the proper locations for utility line easements.
Petroleum products or natural gas transmission lines shall be located in a fifty-foot-minimum
right-of-way, such lines to be installed in the center of the right-of-way. The subdivider shall
provide a fifty-foot right-of-way for all existing transmission lines within the subdivision.
Utility services for residential development not subject to the above-mentioned Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission's order are recommended to be provided through the use of
underground facilities in accord with the standards and approval of the utility company having
appropriate jurisdiction.
§ 510. Erosion and sediment controls and guidelines.

Excavations shall be made to the required depth, and the material upon which the curb is to
be constructed shall be compacted to a firm, even surface to 95% of the maximum dry weight
density of the soil.
Where it is necessary to replace existing vertical curbs with depressed curbing, two ten-footlong
sections of existing curb shall be removed down to the subgrade without disturbing the
adjacent cartway paving. Any portions of the cartway disturbed during curbing removal or
installation will be repaired to new condition.
Curbing shall be constructed in ten-foot lengths. A premolded bituminous impregnated
expansion joint having a minimum thickness of 1/4 inch shall be placed between sections of
curved curb and at intervals of not more than 50 feet. Intermediate joints between ten-foot
sections shall be saw cut. However, wherever a driveway enters a street, the driveway shall
not have a curb joint nor be constructed in lengths longer than 20 feet.
All curb depressions must comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act
and the Pennsylvania Universal Accessibility Act, and the latest Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation RC-67M standards.
Sidewalks. The following construction standards shall be used for sidewalks:
The minimum width of all sidewalks shall be four feet, and a minimum four-foot-wide planting
strip between the curb and sidewalk shall be provided. Additional width may be required, as
determined by the Township, if the walk abuts a fence, a building, walls or parking areas.
Where a sidewalk exists on an adjoining property, the dimensions may be modified to match
existing conditions, provided the sidewalk is located within the road right-of-way.
The grades shall be continuous across driveways, but the concrete sidewalk will stop at each
side of the bituminous driveway as detailed in Appendix A-4.[4]
Editor's Note: Appendix A is attached to this chapter.

aggregate shall be placed and thoroughly compacted prior to laying the sidewalks when used
solely for pedestrian traffic.
Where required by the Board of Supervisors, sidewalks with a minimum width of four feet
shall be installed on both sides of all streets, except that no sidewalks shall be required along
service streets.
All sidewalks shall be placed within the right-of-way, parallel to the right-of-way line. Gradient
shall be continuous across all private driveways, but the concrete sidewalk will stop at the
paved driveway.
Cul-de-sac turnaround.
The end of a cul-de-sac street shall be constructed with a permanent curbed turnaround as
detailed in Appendix A-5.[5] No more than five residential driveways may enter onto the curb
radius or returns of the cul-de-sac turnaround.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is attached to this chapter.
If a cul-de-sac street is intended to be extended within a three-year period after dedication of
the street, a temporary noncurbed turnaround may be considered as detailed in Appendix A-
5.1. The Township may require a barrier to be placed at the end of the temporary turnaround.
The turnaround right-of-way of a cul-de-sac street shall be placed adjacent to the tract
boundary with a fifty-foot right-of-way width provided along or to the boundary line to permit
extension of a street at full width, unless future expansion of a cul-de-sac street is clearly
impractical or undesirable. The small triangles of land beyond the cul-de-sac to the boundary
shall be dedicated to the Township.
Street signs. The subdivider shall furnish and install signposts and street nameplates, approved
by the Township, and at least one street name sign shall be erected at each street intersection.
Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided in addition to a street sign, with a standard "no outlet" sign at
the intersection of a street, furnished and installed by the subdivider.
Street nameplates shall be put at all intersections, naming all streets at each intersection, and
shall be visible from both directions when approaching an intersection. Generally, the sign
shall be parallel to the street that it is identifying.
Street nameplates shall match existing street nameplates as currently used by the Township.
Street nameplates shall be mounted on a metal signpost.
The post shall be equipped with such standard rustproofed hardware as to hold the
nameplates rigidly in a proper and permanent position and to prevent their swaying in the
wind.

Editor's Note: See Ch. 214, Stormwater Management.
Sanitary sewage disposal system(s).
Sanitary sewage disposal systems shall be provided consistent with the design standards
and requirements contained in Article V of this ordinance.
Whenever a subdivider proposes that individual on-site sanitary sewage disposal
systems shall be utilized within the subdivision, the subdivider shall either install such an
approved facility, approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
and/or the Chester County Health Department, or shall guarantee (by deed restriction or
otherwise) as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel within the subdivision that such
facilities can be installed by the purchaser of such lot or parcel.
In all other cases, the subdivider shall provide a complete community or public sanitary
sewage disposal system. The design and installation of such public system shall be
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer and the UTMA. The design and
installation of such community distribution system shall be subject to the approval of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and such system shall be further
subject to the satisfactory provision for the maintenance thereof.
Where studies by the Township Planning Commission or UTMA indicate that construction
or extension of sanitary trunk sewers to serve the property being subdivided appears
probable within a reasonably short time (up to five years), the Township Planning
Commission and the Board of Supervisors shall require the installation and capping of
sanitary sewer mains and house connections, in addition to the installation of temporary,
individual, on-site sanitary sewage disposal systems. It shall, however, be the
responsibility of the Township to supervise the design and installation of such capped
sewers.
Terminal manhole location. In order to provide an efficient sewer system and to minimize
sewer duplication, it is the Township policy that all publicly owned sewer extensions shall
be sized and located to accept the efficient connection of sewers from other subdivisions
or future sewered areas of the Township. During the review of sewer drawings for
proposed subdivision sewers, the UTMA or its engineer will designate future connection
points, if any, to the proposed sewers. The portion of the proposed sewer which is
designated as a connection point shall be extended or situated (at the developer's
expense) on the property boundary at a depth and location provided by the UTMA or its
engineer.
Water supply.
Water supply system(s) shall be installed consistent with design principles and requirements
contained in Article V of this ordinance and Township standards.
Where the subdivider proposes that individual on-site water supply systems shall be utilized
within the subdivision, the subdivider shall either install such facilities or shall guarantee (by
deed restriction or otherwise) as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel within the
subdivision that the facilities can be installed by the purchaser of such lot or parcel.
Wherever feasible, the subdivision shall be provided with a complete public or community
water distribution system. The design and installation of such public system shall be subject
to the approval of the Township Engineer; the design and installation of such community
distribution system shall be subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection; and such system shall be further subject to satisfactory provision
for the maintenance thereof.

for the coupling of equipment serving the Township shall be installed as specified by the Insurance
Services Offices of Pennsylvania. Locations of hydrants shall be approved by the Lionville Fire
Company and by the Township Fire Marshal.
Trails shall be required in any subdivision or land development where it is desirable, in the
opinion of the Board of Supervisors, to provide access to community facilities (schools, shopping
areas, recreation areas, etc.), or to continue sidewalks or trails that are existing in adjacent
developments, or to ensure the safety of pedestrians in unusual or peculiar conditions with respect
to prospective traffic, or where proposed sidewalks and trails are shown on Map 4-4, Plans for
Parks, Recreation and Open Space  Walkway Network, of the Township 2010 Comprehensive
Plan Update.
All trails shall be continually offered to the Township for dedication. A note stating this shall be
placed on the subdivision or land development plan. This shall include a twenty-foot-wide
easement centered on the trail. Additionally, the developer must provide a written continuing
offer of dedication to the Township that includes a metes and bounds description of the
easement.
The following design standards shall be used for trails:
The trail surface shall be bituminous pavement having a minimum depth of three inches.
Trails shall cross roadways and parking lots at a ninety-degree angle and include
appropriate signage. Trail grades shall not exceed 5%. Where trails cross driveways,
they shall be delineated with striping and appropriate signage.
Trails shall be constructed to the dimensions shown in Appendix A-7.[9] Trails shall be a
minimum of six feet wide, except along collector and arterial streets and adjacent to
shopping centers, schools, recreation areas, and other community facilities, where they
shall be a minimum of eight feet wide.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is attached to this chapter.
Trail excavations shall be made to the required depth, and a Class 4, Type B, geotextile
fabric shall be placed over the compacted subgrade. A subbase layer of crushed stone,
PennDOT 2-A Type C, not less than six inches thick, shall be placed and thoroughly
compacted prior to laying the trail (this may be achieved in one lift). The base course
shall extend out a distance of 18 inches from the paved width on either side of the trail
before tapering to subgrade.
Trail paving shall consist of a bituminous concrete base course having a compacted
depth of two inches and a wearing course having a compacted depth of one inch. A tack
coat shall be applied between the two courses, and any joints must be sealed. Trails
under construction shall comply with the requirements of § 602.12.b of this ordinance.
Trails shall be constructed with appropriate drainage swales and surface pitch or
crowning so that water flows off the trail in a perpendicular sheet flow.
Trails shall be graded at street or parking lot intersections to provide handicapped
accessibility.
Trails shall provide connections to the development's internal sidewalk system and any
adjacent tract's trails and sidewalk systems. Alignments do not necessarily have to follow
exactly those proposed in Map 4-4, Plans for Parks, Recreation and Open Space 
Walkway Network, of the Township 2010 Comprehensive Plan Update; however, they
should enter/depart the development in close proximity to the alignment shown.

Editor's Note: Appendix A is attached to this chapter.
§ 603. Monuments and markers.
Monuments shall be placed at sufficient locations to define the exact location of all roads and to
enable the reestablishment of all road lines. In general, monuments shall be set on the road line
on one side of the road at the beginning and ending of all curves and at those points on the curve
at road intersections necessary to establish the actual intersection. Monuments shall be placed at
the tract perimeter where no markers exist, as required by the Township.
Markers shall be placed at all points where lot lines intersect road lines or other lot lines, at all
angle points in lot lines, and tangent points of curves, except where concrete monuments are
required.
Monuments shall be concrete with a minimum top width of four inches by four inches and a
bottom width of six inches by six inches. The minimum height shall be 24 inches. The concrete
monument shall have a metal component detectable by an electromagnetic locator.
Markers shall be steel bars at least 24 inches long and not less than 5/8 inch in diameter.
Utility easements shall be monumented at their beginning, their end, and at all directed changes.
The monumentations shall be placed in the ground after final grading is completed. The
monumentation shall be either a concrete monument or marker, as required by the Township.
All monuments and markers shall be certified for accuracy by the developer's engineer and their
accuracy checked by the Township Engineer. Accuracy of monument/markers shall be within
3/100 of a foot.
In cases where it is impossible to set a monument or where the permanency of a monument
may be better ensured by offsetting the monument with a reference monument(s), the Township
may authorize such procedure, provided that proper instrument sights may be obtained and
complete offset data is designated on the record plan. A reference monument (preferably two)
should be set on the boundary line(s) that intersect the corner.
§ 604. Easements.
Easements with a minimum width of 30 feet shall be provided for all utilities. Additional width
may be required for access and maintenance as determined by the Township. Permanent or
temporary construction easements may also be required at the sole discretion of the Township.
Easements shall be centered on or adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
Nothing shall be permitted to be placed, planted, set or put within the area of an easement
unless necessary for the purpose of the easement, including but not limited to plants, trees or
fences.

§ 507. PIC Planned Industrial-Commercial District.
Purpose. The purpose of the PIC Planned Industrial-Commercial District is to provide sufficient
space in appropriate locations to meet current and anticipated future regional needs for large-site
industrial and commercial development appropriate to the community. It is further intended that the
PIC District encourage industrial and commercial development that will benefit the community and
the region, both economically and aesthetically, by permitting investment in a planned facility that
will provide for the location of several plants and/or commercial establishments to insure efficient
integration and consolidation of access to existing and planned future roadways and utilities. The
requirement for a plan will provide the Board of Supervisors with a means to review proposals and
permit the development of those facilities which, in addition to demonstrating a contribution to the
community and the region, would incorporate design innovations in buildings and landscaping that
would minimize any adverse impacts on adjacent uses. It is envisioned that these benefits would
accrue with the development of a unified tract designed to integrate various, single industrial
plants and/or commercial establishments. Any use permitted in this district by right, special
exception or condition and described in § 611 of this ordinance is subject to the requirements set
forth in § 611.
Review procedures. Planned Industrial-Commercial developments shall be subject to the
procedures for site plan review and approval established by the Township Subdivision and Land
Development.
Permitted uses.
Manufacturing, wholesaling, processing, warehousing and distributing, provided that no bulk
storage of liquid or gaseous fuels shall be permitted except for consumption on the premises.

By conditional use. Subject to § 806, the setbacks required when a building abuts a
residential or agricultural district or a lot containing an occupied dwelling may be reduced from
150 feet to a distance determined by the Board of Supervisors to be sufficient to allow for
proper protection of abutting property and its use but in no case to a distance less than the
district normally requires.
In every instance where a setback of 150 feet is required by this section or a reduced setback
is approved by conditional use pursuant to Subsection f, below, the said setback shall be
improved as a buffer and shall provide on installation a year-round visual screen by a
combination of planted berms, fences, walls, coniferous and deciduous trees, shrubs and
other plantings. No other structures or signage (excepting underground utilities) shall be
permitted within the setback buffer and no parking shall be there located. Impervious surfaces
within the setback buffer shall be limited to necessary access drives designed and located so
as to minimize the interruption of the visual screen. The following additional requirements
shall also be met:
A setback buffer plan prepared and sealed by and over the signature of a registered
landscape architect authorized to provide professional services in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania shall be submitted as an integral component of the application for special
exception, conditional use approval, or preliminary subdivision and land development
plan approval, whichever is first submitted. The said plan shall comply with the general
requirements applicable to preliminary subdivision and land development plan
submissions and shall contain sufficient information to determine compliance with this
section.
Berms shall be employed whenever the existing topography permits.
Existing mature trees located within the setback buffer shall be preserved using, where
necessary, tree wells and/or tree walls and, where preserved, shall be counted toward
the satisfaction of the numerical planting requirements of this section.
Where fences and walls are employed to create the mandatory visual screen they shall
be not less than eight feet in height (except within clear-sight triangles).
The type, design, location, configuration, materials, and colors of fences and walls shall
be responsive to the visual and aesthetic characteristic of the tract and adjoining lands
and uses, shall create visual interest from the perspective of adjoining properties, and
shall avoid conflict with the character of adjoining uses.
In those areas of the setback buffer improved with an approved fence or wall, there shall
additionally be planted on the side of the fence or wall facing the adjoining property: one
coniferous tree per 20 lineal feet of buffer, one canopy tree per 30 lineal feet of buffer,
one flowering tree per 60 lineal feet of buffer, and one each of deciduous and flowering
shrubs (at a ratio of one-to-one) per 30 lineal feet of buffer.
In those areas of the setback buffer not proposed to be improved with a fence or wall,
there shall be planted: two coniferous trees, one canopy tree, one flowering tree, and one
deciduous or one flowering shrub (at a ratio of one-to-one) per 20 lineal feet of buffer
planted generally in a double staggered row so as to achieve a naturalistic effect to the
maximum extent consistent with the requirement of providing on installation a year-round
visual screen.
Canopy trees shall be of an approved species and not less than three lineal inches in
caliper on installation; coniferous trees shall be of an approved species and not less than
eight feet in height on installation; shrubs shall be of an approved species and not less
than two feet in height on installation.

space purposes, the front, rear or side yard buffer setback required by Subsections 507.8.a
through c on the side thus abutted may, if approved by conditional use by the Board of
Supervisors, be reduced to the greater of 75 feet or three feet for every one foot of building
height on the PCID lot (to a maximum setback requirement of 150 feet), even if said
agricultural or open space lot contains an occupied dwelling. The provisions of Subsection

Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the
passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,[1] delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to promote public health,
safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of the Township
of Uwchlan does hereby order as follows.
Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
General provisions.
Intent. The intent of this section is to:
Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or
minimize flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its
residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the
Township of Uwchlan unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section supersedes any other conflicting provisions
which may be in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions

shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If
there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this section, the more restrictive shall
apply.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this section
shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the
remaining portions of the section, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable.
Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this section is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This section
does not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This section shall not create liability on the part of the Township of Uwchlan or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Administration.
Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
The Township Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this section
and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator
may: A) fulfill the duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations; B) delegate
duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel,
plan examiners, inspectors, and other employees; or C) enter into a written agreement or
written contract with another agency or private sector entity to administer specific
provisions of these regulations. Administration of any part of these regulations by another
entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator
duties are to be fulfilled by the Assistant Township Zoning Officer.
Permits required. A permit shall be required before any construction or development is
undertaken within any area of the Township of Uwchlan.
Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has been determined that
the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this
and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the
application for the permit to determine if all other necessary government permits required
by state and federal laws have been obtained, such as those required by the
Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam
Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended); the Pennsylvania Clean
Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended);[2] and the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 404,
33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall be issued until this determination has been made.
Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq., 32 P.S. § 693.1 et seq. and 35 P.S. § 691.1 et
seq., respectively.

In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any development/permit, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review the proposed cost of improvements or repairs and
the preimprovement market value of the structure, so that a substantial
improvement/substantial damage determination can be made, in accordance with
FEMA's Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference.
In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any development/permit, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review the history of repairs to the subject building, so that
any cumulative substantial damage concerns can be addressed before the permit is
issued.
During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official
shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with
the information provided on the permit application and with all applicable municipal laws
and ordinances. He/she shall make as many inspections during and upon completion of
the work as are necessary.
In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall have the authority to
enter any building, structure, premises or development in the identified floodplain area,
upon presentation of proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions
of this section.
In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not comply with
the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a
false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the Board of Supervisors for whatever action it
considers necessary.
The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity, or for the lifetime of the
structure, all records associated with the requirements of this section including, but not
limited to, finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting a biennial report to
FEMA concerning community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program as
requested.
The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments of the Floodplain
Administrator can be delegated from the person identified. However, the ultimate
responsibility lies with the person identified in the floodplain ordinance as the floodplain
administrator/manager.
The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of the 34 Pa. Code and the
2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC, or the latest revision thereof as adopted by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Application procedures and requirements.
Application for such a permit shall be made, in writing, to the Floodplain Administrator on
forms supplied by the Township of Uwchlan. Such application shall contain the following:

Floodplain Administrator. Requests for any such change shall be in writing, and shall be
submitted by the applicant to Floodplain Administrator for consideration.
Placards. In addition to the permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a placard, or
similar document, which shall be displayed on the premises during the time construction is in
progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit, the date of its issuance, and be
signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
Start of construction.
Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180 days after the

does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation
for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant,
who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to
approve such a request and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and
FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.
Enforcement.
Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized municipal
representative determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has
been a violation of any provisions of this section, or of any regulations adopted pursuant
thereto, the Floodplain Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as
hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
Be in writing;
Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;

Identification of floodplain areas.
Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
Any areas of Township of Uwchlan, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs)
in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated September 29, 2017, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments
are hereby adopted by Township of Uwchlan and declared to be a part of this section.
Description and special requirements of identified floodplain areas. The identified floodplain
area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway
and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
special flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.

The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided but no floodway has been determined.
No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development shall be permitted in an AE Zone without floodway, unless it
has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed development
together with all other existing and anticipated development, would not result in
an increase in flood levels of more than one foot within the entire community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured
50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other
acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is
not available, the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction
site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. In the absence of
any of the above data or documentation, the community may require elevation of the
lowest floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones AO and AH on the
FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by one-percent-annualchance
shallow flooding where average depths are between one foot and three feet. In
Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes.
Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where Township of
Uwchlan has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as delineated and adopted
on a local flood hazard map using best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
Changes in identification of area. The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by
the Board of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the
special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a
community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data. See § 510.5a(2) for situations where FEMA notification is required.

Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township of Uwchlan and any party aggrieved by
this decision or determination may appeal to the Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.
Jurisdictional boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation
or other corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall
review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community
shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation or corporate
boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Technical provisions.
General.
Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action
have been notified by the municipality, and until all required permits or approvals
have first been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the
flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any
watercourse.
When Township of Uwchlan proposes to permit the following encroachments: any
development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any
development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway,
which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges); the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur.
Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of map change and
prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence
to FEMA of the adoption of floodplain management ordinances incorporating the
increased base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the post-project
condition.
Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, the applicant shall provide as-built
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such
certifications in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any identified
floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in
this section and any other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
Within any identified floodplain area, no new structures shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse.

Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
Existing structures in identified floodplain areas.
Existing structures. The provisions of this section do not require any changes or
improvements to be made to lawfully existing structures. However, when an improvement is
made to any existing structure, the provisions of § 510.7b shall apply.
Improvements. The following provisions shall apply whenever any improvement is made to an
existing structure located within any identified floodplain area:
No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be allowed within any
identified floodplain area that would cause any increase in BFE. In A Area/District(s),
BFEs are determined using the methodology in § 510.4b(3).
Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to an existing
structure to an extent or amount of 50% or more of its market value shall constitute a
substantial improvement and shall be undertaken only in full compliance with the
provisions of this section.
The above activity shall also address the requirements of the 34 Pa. Code, as amended,
and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or most recent revision thereof as adopted by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Within any Floodway Area/District (See § 510.4b(1)), no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
Within any AE Area/District without Floodway (See § 510.4b(2)), no new construction or
development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-ofbank
of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department
of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to an existing
structure, to an extent or amount of less than 50% of its market value, shall be elevated
and/or floodproofed to the greatest extent possible.
Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind that meets the
definition of "cumulative substantial damage" shall be undertaken only in full compliance
with the provisions of this section.
Variances.
General. If compliance with any of the requirements of this section would result in an
exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or landowner, the Township of
Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application of
the requirements.
Variance procedures and conditions. Requests for variances shall be considered by the
Township of Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures contained in
§ 510.3; and the following:
No variance shall be granted within any identified floodplain area that would cause any
increase in BFE. In A Area/District, BFEs are determined using the methodology in
§ 510.4b(3).
Except for a possible modification of the regulatory flood elevation requirement involved,
no variance shall be granted for any of the other requirements pertaining specifically to
development regulated by Development Which May Endanger Human Life (§ 510.5d).

510.9
No variance shall be granted for prohibited activities (§ 510.6).
If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification necessary to provide relief.
In granting any variance, the Township of Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board shall attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare, and to achieve the objectives of this section.
Whenever a variance is granted, the Township of Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that:
The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance.
Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
In reviewing any request for a variance, the Township of Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board
shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
That there is good and sufficient cause.
That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant.
That the granting of the variance will:
Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense;
Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the public, or conflict with any
other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by the
Township of Uwchlan Zoning Hearing Board. In addition, a report of all variances granted
during the year shall be included in the annual report to the FEMA.
Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be designed and
constructed so as to have the capability of resisting the one-percent-annual-chance flood.

structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which
the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
substantial damage or cumulative substantial damage regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and
which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

single-family detached dwelling or in a building accessory to a single-family detached dwelling
by one or more occupants of the dwelling who maintain full-time residence in the dwelling or
the owner together with a maximum of four paid or unpaid assistants or employees. The
single-family dwelling need not be owner occupied. A livable occupied residence must be
maintained at all times.
This overlay applies only to residence on Route 113, and each one must apply individually for
a home occupation permit and submit a site plan showing compliance with § 602 in its
entirety.
The following are permitted major home occupation uses within the HO-2 Overlay:

General regulations for off-street parking.
Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence at the date of adoption of this ordinance
shall not be subject to the requirements of this section so long as the kind or extent of use is
not changed, provided that any parking facility now serving structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced below such requirements.
Changes in use. Whenever a structure is altered or a use is changed or extended which
currently complies or is deficient with regard to the required number of parking spaces, but
result in an increase to the parking requirements of § 607.1, then the total additional parking
required for the alteration, change or extension shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of that section.
Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any use that interferes with its
availability for the parking need it is required to serve.
Continuing character of obligation. All required parking facilities shall be provided and
maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities were designed to serve. Off-street
parking facilities shall not be reduced in total extent except when such reduction is in
conformity with the requirements of this section.
Modification of requirements.
Joint use. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a common parking lot
either on or off the site, by special exception if the total space provided is not less than
the sum of the spaces required for each use individually, unless otherwise specifically set
forth herein.
The owners of two or more establishments shall submit with their applications for
special exception a site plan showing joint use, written agreement approved by the
Township Solicitor and accepted by the Board of Supervisors and location of a
common off-street parking area.
Some portion of the common off-street parking area shall lie within 200 feet of an
entrance, regularly used by patrons, into the buildings served thereby.
Conditional reduction of off-street parking areas. In order to prevent the establishment of
a greater number of parking spaces than is actually required to serve the needs of the
particular mix of enterprises in a shopping center or large single commercial use, or a
single use such as an office building, stand-alone restaurant, retail store and any other
such use, the Board of Supervisors, after holding a conditional use hearing pursuant to

public notice and consulting with the Township Planning Commission and Township
Engineer, may permit a reduction of parking spaces if the following conditions are
satisfied:
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
The applicant must present written justification for a reduction in the required parking
spaces of a commercial, industrial, or public and semipublic use.
The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land development plan, required
for the conditional use application, must designate sufficient space to provide for the
total requirement of parking spaces as set forth in § 607.1. In addition to the layout
for the total number of parking spaces the plan shall illustrate these required parking
spaces which one requested to be removed.
The conditional reduction shall permit up to a 20% reduction in the required number
of parking spaces if it can be demonstrated to the Board of Supervisors that the
hours or days of peak parking need for the uses are so different that a lower total will
provide adequately for all uses served by the common parking facility. This initial
phase of the parking provision shall be clearly indicated on the plan.
The required parking space area may be exempted from the required area and bulk
regulations, provided that the remaining area of the total minimum computed parking
area is included as open space. The exempted parking area will not be counted as
permanent provided open space to satisfy other requirements of this ordinance.
The exempted parking area provided for in open space shall no longer be an
exemption to the required paved area, if at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, a parking problem is caused.
The landowner or developer shall enter into a written agreement at the time any
conditional reduction is granted with the Board of Supervisors that, at any time after
one year following the issuing of the last occupancy permit, any additional parking
spaces shall be provided at the expense of the landowner or developer, should it be
determined the full parking space requirement, or portion thereof, is necessary to
satisfy the need of the particular mix of uses or single use in a shopping center or
other major commercial use.
Storm drainage and stormwater management facilities must be sized and
constructed to handle the full parking space requirement.
Location of parking spaces. Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or
premises with the principal use served, except in the case of joint use as per § 607.2.e where
parking may be located on the adjoining lot.
Fractional spaces. Where the computation of required parking spaces results in a fractional
number, the fraction of 1/2 or more shall be counted as one.
Maintenance of parking and loading areas. For parking areas of three or more vehicles, that
portion of the parking and loading area not landscaped and so maintained, including
driveways and entranceways, shall be graded, surfaced, and drained in accordance with the
standards set forth in the Uwchlan Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance,
to the extent necessary to prevent nuisance of dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across
streets and adjoining properties.
Parking area reservation. All off-street parking areas shall be reserved and used for vehicle
parking only, with no sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind on
lots in any residential districts. Camping trailers, house trailers, mobile homes, boats,
unregistered or inoperative motor equipment, or similar durables shall not be stored nor

parked within the required front yard except as specifically provided in other provisions of this
ordinance. The parking of one commercial vehicle of up to one ton only within the side or rear
yard is permitted if needed by an individual for his livelihood for a business not conducted on
the premises; or one vehicle used for recreational use such as a travel trailer or recreational
vehicle is permitted for storage purposes only, within the rear yard, and is not to be used for
sleeping, recreational or living purposes at any time or in any way, shape, or form on the lot in
question.
A garage or carport may be located wholly or partly inside the walls of the principal building,
or attached to the outer walls. If separated from the principal building, the garage shall
conform to all setback requirements of the principal building. The garage may be constructed
under a yard or court.
Automotive vehicles, boats, or trailers of any kind or type without current license plates shall
not be parked or stored on any public street.
No repair to or maintenance of vehicles of any kind, except emergency repairs, shall be
permitted in any accessory parking facility. However, one unlicenced car may be permitted for
the removal of parts, provided that no such vehicle shall be located within the front yard, nor
retained on the premises in excess of six months.
Parking areas cannot be utilized or credited toward required open space.
Parking area design standards. The design standards specified below shall be required for all
off-street parking facilities with a capacity of five or more vehicles built after the effective date of
this ordinance.
All parking spaces shall be a minimum of 9.5 feet by 20 feet, except where nine feet by 18
feet is permitted, and except for handicapped parking spaces which shall be 12 feet by 20
feet. Where parked vehicles abut a grass strip of at least four feet in width, the parking space
may be reduced to nine feet by 18 feet. In the case of single retail stores or shopping centers,
the Board of Supervisors may require up to 50% of the spaces to be 10 feet rather than 9.5
feet wide. The Board of Supervisors may also require more ten-foot-wide spaces if the Board
determines that a proposal for any type of building warrants a percentage of these larger
spaces. The location for any percentage of the larger spaces shall also be as determined by
the Board.

fencing or walls, and/or mounding through the use of earthen berms forming a continuous
visual buffer. When planting screens are employed, a planting strip shall be provided at 10
feet in width which shall be located within twenty-foot setback referenced in § 607.8B(7)
above and include trees and shrubs reasonably dispersed along the perimeter of the TPF.
Two types of buffer strips shall be used to screen the parking structure:
External screen: a vegetative planting strip used on the periphery of the TPF between
external adjoining property lines and rights-of-way and the TPF itself. The purpose of
this screen is to visually block a significant majority of the TPF from adjoining properties
and roads. Deciduous, evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation shall be included in
the buffer. A majority of the species used in the screen shall be either evergreen or
semi-evergreen.
Internal screen: a vegetative strip used on the periphery of the TPF between internal
roads, drives and buildings to lightly screen the TPF. Deciduous and semi-evergreen
vegetation shall be used in the buffer. The intent of this buffer is to provide shade and
visually provide a vegetative edge to the TPF. No plantings above 2.5 feet in height may
be used within any driveway or ramp clear sight triangle as defined by the Township.
The type of screening to be employed shall be subject to review during the subdivision and
land development process, at which time, a landscape plan prepared by a landscape
architect registered in the State of Pennsylvania shall be provided.
Lighting. A TPF shall comply with the criteria set forth in § 615 (Lighting Ordinance) except
that § 615C.4.b shall not apply and freestanding lighting fixtures may be placed within the
parking areas of the structure when said fixtures are securely attached to an extended
concrete base extending a minimum of 2'0" above finished grade.
§ 608. Screening.
All outdoor storage, parking, and/or loading areas of industrial uses shall be screened from view
from any residential or commercial development or public right-of-way by a landscape screen or
other visual barrier with planting. The screening shall be placed between the industrial use and
contiguous residential and/or commercial zoning district.
The landscaped screen shall be composed of evergreen plants and trees arranged to provide
screening of sufficient height and density to conceal from view the parking and/or loading areas
from adjacent property owners.
All outdoor use operations, mechanical equipment, and other functional accessories of each
building, such as elevator, penthouse, ventilation pipes and ducts, water pressure tanks, heating,
air conditioning, and power supply units shall have an architecturally compatible building material
screen or covering which is an integral part of the building envelope and/or which is harmonious
with the building design.
An alternative visual barrier shall be an opaque fence or wall with plantings of trees, shrubs,
and/or vines along the surfaces of the barrier facing any adjacent property.

Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
It is the intent of this section to provide for smaller lots than normally required and in so doing
safeguard sensitive natural features and create and protect open spaces for use by existing
and future residents of the Township. The purpose of this approach is to encourage the
preservation of large, stream valley and hilly lands of the Township as well as other areas for
agriculture, recreation, conservation and various kinds of open space uses while assuring in
all cases that the entire area shall be protected in perpetuity by conservation easements. It is
also the intent of the section to facilitate the conservation of surface and underground water
supplies, the control of soil erosion and surface-water flooding and overall to minimize the
potential adverse effects of land development on the Township.
It is also the intent of this section to discourage intensive development in those locations
unsuited for such uses as described in the above subsection.

In order to qualify for consideration as a residential open space option, the tract of land to
be subdivided by the applicant must have a minimum lot area of 10 acres. The Board of
Supervisors may allow a reduction of the minimum ten-acre requirement if by conditional
use if it determines the use of the residential open space option on a tract of land less
than 10 acres preserves significant environmentally sensitive areas, historical structures
or the open space enhances the Township's existing open space system.
[Amended 5-11-1998 by Ord. No. 98-06]
The maximum permitted number of lots for development under the residential open
space option shall be determined in accordance with the following table by multiplying the
gross acreage of the tract proposed for development by the applicable factor:

All buildings/dwellings shall be able to connect to a public water supply system in
operation at the time when construction of a principal building/dwelling is started.
The number of lots subdivided does not exceed the maximum number of lots
permitted by the zoning regulations and the aggregate impervious coverage of the
tract does not exceed 25% of the entire tract.
The balance of the tract (total tract minus lotted area and street rights-of-way) is
permanently preserved as common open space which may be owned and
maintained in any one, or a combination of several of the following ways which will
be subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors:
Deed common open space to the Township.
Create a homeowners' association to own and maintain.
The common open space be owned by the Township but maintained by the
homeowners association, with funds, as determined by the Board of
Supervisors, for future maintenance of the open space being provided by the
developer before dedication of public improvements. The governing documents
for the development shall include provisions which insure that the common open
space land shall continue as such and be properly maintained in accordance
with an approved open space management plan as described in § 617 of this
ordinance.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
The nature, extent, location, and use of common open space shall be subject to
approval by the Board of Supervisors and shall, as a minimum, meet the following
requirements:
Common open space may consist of natural features, woodland or historic sites,
floodplains, alluvial soils or high water table soils (wetlands), agricultural
preservation, walking trails, other passive recreation, protection of other natural
features, and resources, including those which the Board of Supervisors may
determine "unique" to the area. Common open space must remain in its natural
condition unless designed for active or passive recreation as delineated on the
approved subdivision plan as outlined below.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Common open space, or a portion thereof, may be required to be provided with

any acceptable condition before dedication of any public improvements in the
subdivision or in lieu of such condition a bond for any improvements to the
common open space necessitated by the open space option shall be furnished
by the developer.
Nothing herein shall require the Township to accept dedication of common open
space land. However, any property or portion of property, deeded to the Township,
shall be retained for public use. Common open space shall be deed restricted to
prevent any further subdivision and restrict the uses to those set forth herein.
All reductions in lot sizes below 50% of the applicable zoning district requirements
shall comply with the following standards and all other applicable procedures and
standards set forth in this ordinance:
For each 1% below 50% that the lot is reduced there shall be a corresponding
1 1/4% increase in the amount of open space required for the development.
In calculating density for developments that propose a reduction in lot size of
more than 50%, the applicant shall first prepare a yield plan as defined in
§ 301.4 of the Zoning Ordinance. The number of lots shown on the yield plan
shall be the permitted yield on the reduced size lot plan. In any event, the yield
shall never be greater than that allowed under § 609.1.c(2) but may be reduced
by natural features or other constraints.
At no time shall the lot reduction being sought exceed 80% nor shall the actual
size of the lot be less than 10,000 square feet or have side yard setbacks less
than 15 feet.
Area and bulk regulations. All lot width and yard requirements normally applicable to the tract of
land may be waived, subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors, provided that:
Building height shall not exceed 2 1/2 stories or 35 feet, whichever is less.
Yards facing adjacent properties along the tract boundaries shall meet all minimum yard
requirements of the appropriate zoning district, except when adjacent tracts have previously
been built upon, using the open space option, in which case, yard requirements of yards
adjacent to tract boundaries may be reduced to the size used in adjacent built-up lots.
Innovative layout of lots, siting of structures and architectural design is recommended to
provide for the health and general welfare otherwise infringed upon through reduction in lot
size and waiver of yard requirements. As part of any application for approval of an open
space option proposal, the developer shall show siting of all structures within the subdivision,
their setbacks from lot lines and percent coverage of the lot by impervious cover materials.
Design standards.
Subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors, sidewalk requirements normally applicable
to any subdivision may be waived in certain portions of the subdivision if a suitable pathway
system, apart from the street right-of-way, is provided and serves all those dwelling units for
which a sidewalk would normally be required.
Subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors, minimum cartway width may be reduced on
any street if:
Vehicular traffic has been suitably separated from pedestrian traffic.

Adequate off-street parking has been provided in sufficient quantity to warrant such
reduction.
Such reduction does not impede circulation of traffic, especially emergency vehicles.
§ 610. Helistops and heliports.
Helistops and heliports are permitted within the Township as a special exception subject to the
following general requirements.
Where permitted as an accessory use on the same lot with, and incidental to a use permitted in
the particular zoning district, the heliport or helistop also shall comply with the area, coverage and
yard requirements of the applicable zoning district, however, in no case shall any such landing
surface be located closer than 300 feet from any residential district boundary line.
The landing surface shall be paved and level, and shall be at least 60 feet square or in the case of
a circle shall be at least 60 feet in diameter. A secondary thirty-foot perimeter area shall adjoin the
landing surface, and, if not paved, shall contain a gravel or grass cover. Both the landing surface
and secondary perimeter shall be well maintained and shall be kept dirt-free to preclude blowing
dust or debris caused by other obstacles other than those required for safety purposes. Rooftop
pads do not require this surface.
The entire perimeter area shall be enclosed by a securable, well constructed fence, a minimum of
four feet high, which will serve to prevent unauthorized entry into the landing area. Trees,
shrubbery, and other landscaping and/or acoustical barrier where appropriate shall be provided in
quantities and dimensions deemed necessary by the Planning Commission and Zoning Hearing
Board to minimize offensive noise and to afford a softening of the visual impact of the landing
area. Rooftop pads shall be excluded from these requirements.
At least two approach lanes to each landing pad shall be provided and maintained free of
obstructions and shall be located within 45° left or right of the prevailing winds of the landing pad
to a width of 1,000 feet, and shall have a glide angle slope of eight to one measured from the
outer edge of the pad.
Clear areas for emergency landings of the helicopter in the event of mechanical failure shall be
available. Such emergency landing areas shall be located within the normal glide range of the
helicopter with one engine off when operating in the approved takeoff or landing lane.
An application for a landing pad on a roof shall be accompanied by a certification by a registered
engineer that the loads imposed by the helicopter will be supported by the structure.
All fire and safety equipment provided in conjunction with a heliport or helistop shall be subject to
the approval of the Township Fire Marshall.
In reviewing any application for a heliport of helistop, the Zoning Hearing Board shall be guided by
the standards of review included in § 903.5 hereof, and, in addition, may impose restrictions on
hours of operation, lighting, noise levels, and flight altitude over residential areas, and such other
requirements as may be appropriate and reasonable to protect the health, welfare, and safety of
Township residents and their property.
No permit shall be used for the construction of a heliport until the site plan has been approved by
the Planning Commission.

§ 611. Conditional uses.
[Amended 10-14-1997 by Ord. No. 97-11]
Notwithstanding any other section or provision of this ordinance, with respect to any proposed use
meeting the following criteria shall be permitted only by conditional use in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in § 806 of this ordinance:
Any residential open space option that:
[Amended 10-22-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-04]
Is less than 10 acres.
Reduces lot size by more than 50%.
Proposes on-site sewage systems.
Any restaurant, tearoom, cafe, confectionery or other place serving food or beverages whether
freestanding or occupying a portion of a building containing another use.
Any nonresidential structure(s) on one lot that contain more than 40,000 square feet or have total
combined parking space count of over 200.
Any structure(s) on a lot used strictly for retail use with a combined size of 10,000 square feet or
more.
[Amended 8-10-1998 by Ord. No. 98-13]
Any nonresidential development having three or more lots or three or more buildings on one lot
shall have the option of having one conditional use hearing at which time a master concept plan
with restrictive covenants would be approved. With the successful completion of this process, the
developer would be exempted from individual conditional use hearings for each site or building
as required by other sections of this ordinance as long as the site development plan is deemed
to be in keeping with the master concept plan. As an alternative to a master conditional use
hearing, the owner/developer may submit to the Township restrictive covenants in form and
substance satisfactory to the Township in its sole discretion, which shall bind the subject property
and development in perpetuity. The restrictive covenants shall be recorded against the subject
property in the office of Recorder of Deeds of Chester County prior to preliminary land

development approval. The restrictive covenants, at a minimum, shall include covenants and
conditions necessary to ameliorate the impact of the proposed development and to satisfy the
objective and subjective standards and criteria set forth in the Zoning Ordinance applicable to
conditional uses in general and the proposed use specifically. The covenants may include
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the Zoning Ordinance, as the
Township may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,[1] the Zoning Ordinance, and to protect the health, safety and welfare of, and
prevent any financial or other burden on, the Township and its residents. All developments
existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance that have gone through the conditional use
process and have master concept plan approval and restrictive covenants in place shall also be
exempted from further conditional use hearings pursuant to this ordinance.

[Amended 11-10-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-04; 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Adoption. The Historic Resources Map and Inventory, together with the classifications set
forth in § 612.3.b and any explanatory material, is hereby adopted and incorporated by
reference as part of this ordinance, together with any revisions approved in accordance with
§ 612.3.c. The Historic Resources Map and Inventory shall be on file in the Township
administrative offices and shall be the final authority as to the designation and description of
historic resources in the Township, regardless of any unofficial copies which may be made or
published from time to time.[1]
Editor's Note: The Historic Resources Map and Inventory, and the Historic Resources
Inventory List, are included as attachments to this chapter.
Classifications. The Historic Resources Map and Inventory delineates the following
classifications of the historic resources in Uwchlan Township, as defined below:
Class 1: historic buildings and structures certified by the Secretary of the Interior and
listed by the National Park Service (NPS) on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
Class 2 DOE-Eligible: buildings and structures (including those within the Lionville
Historic District) part or all of which were built prior to 1900 and have received an
approved determination of eligibility (DOE) by the NPS based upon the review and
opinion of the Bureau of Historic Preservation (BHP) of the Pennsylvania Historical and
Museum Commission (PHMC) and are listed as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Class 3: buildings and structures part or all of which were built prior to 1900 that are
included in the Historic Resources Map and Inventory and i) which are documented on a
Pennsylvania historic resource survey form and retain local, state, or national
significance per National Register criteria or for their local significance or ii) which meet
two or more of the criteria listed below:
Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of local, state or national history.
Associated with the lives of persons significant in local, state or national history.
Possess the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction.
Exhibit a high degree of original architectural integrity. This integrity should be
judged in light of the architectural period best represented by the buildings and not
conjecture on how the resource once appeared.
Yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in history or prehistory.
Architecturally significant.
Please note: Though not classified, properties that contain buildings, sites,
structures, and objects that are 50 to 80 years old and whose information has been
recorded by the BHP but no evaluations have been conducted or completed, and

are therefore listed as "undetermined," are listed and available at the Uwchlan
Township Historical Commission.
Revisions. The Historic Resources Map and Inventory may be revised from time to time by
administrative action of the Board of Supervisors.
In considering any revision, including additions, deletions, or changes of classification to
the Historic Resources Map and Inventory, the Board may receive a written
recommendation from the Uwchlan Township Historical Commission.
The owners of any property which is the subject of any such proposed administrative
action shall be given written notice by the Zoning Officer at the order of the Board of
Supervisors at least 10 days prior to the public meeting where the proposed
administrative action is on the agenda.
Historic resources inventory list. The Township shall maintain an updated list of resources
shown on the Historic Resources Map and Inventory and their respective classifications.[2]
Editor's Note: The Historic Resources Inventory List is included as an attachment to this
chapter.
Demolition (in whole or part) of historic resources.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Demolition by neglect. No historic resource shall be demolished by neglect. Unoccupied
structures should be tightly sealed and fenced off and the utilities turned off for safety.
Demolition of historic resources by permit. The following procedure is established for the
issuance of a permit for demolition of an historic resource in order to facilitate the purposes of
this section and to allow for consideration of alternatives to the demolition of the historic
resource by the owner of the resource:
Demolition permit. No historic resource shall be intentionally demolished, razed, or
otherwise disturbed, eradicated or destroyed, in whole or in part, unless a permit is
obtained from the Zoning Officer in accordance with the procedures and requirements of
this section and other applicable standards and procedures of Township ordinances and
codes. Except as provided in § 612.4.b(3) hereinbelow, the Zoning Officer shall not make
a decision on an application for a demolition permit for an historic resource until issuance
of the recommendation of the Board of Supervisors as required by this section.
Removal of existing significant exterior architectural features. Demolition, for purposes of
the foregoing permit requirements, shall include the removal of any existing significant
exterior architectural features on an historic resource if such features are identified as
such on a National Register nomination or Pennsylvania historic resources survey form
or so deemed by the Zoning Officer.
Preapplication meeting required. A meeting between the applicant and the Zoning Officer
shall be required prior to the official submittal of a demolition permit application. The
purpose of this meeting is to foster communication about the demolition proposal and
possible alternatives for the resource in question. The Zoning Officer shall inspect the
interior and exterior of the resource with the applicant. If the Zoning Officer determines
that the resource appears to be structurally sound as a whole, the applicant shall follow
the procedure set forth hereinbelow. If the Zoning Officer determines that the resource is
structurally defective to a degree that the structure is in danger of collapse or is a threat
to public safety, the Zoning Officer may issue the demolition permit without compliance
with the procedures set forth hereinbelow.
Application requirements for the demolition, in whole or part, of historic resources. In
addition to applicable requirements under the Township Building Code, any applicant

If the applicant is directed to prepare a financial analysis, the sixty-day deferral
period above shall be extended a period of 30 additional days after the complete
submission of the financial analysis is delivered to the Township.
The applicant shall be notified of the Board of Supervisors meeting at which the
application for demolition is to be considered at least 10 days prior to the date of the
meeting and shall have the opportunity to present the applicant's reasons for
demolishing the historic resource and filing the application. Within five days of
making its decision, the Board of Supervisors shall provide written communication of

Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the authority of the Zoning Officer to deny a
permit for:
Failure to provide the information required by this section or any other ordinance
of the Township, including but not limited to the financial analysis if required by
the Board of Supervisors;
Failure to comply with any other ordinance or code of the Township.
Financial analysis for the demolition of an historic resource. The Board of Supervisors
may require an applicant to submit a financial analysis prepared by qualified
professionals in historic preservation, planning, finance, appraisal and related disciplines,
which shall be verified as true and correct by the applicant and the professionals, which
shall include at least the following:
Amount paid for property, date of purchase and party from whom purchased,
including a description of the relationship, whether business or familial, if any,
between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased.

demolition permit to the applicant (provided all other ordinance and code requirements of
the Township have been satisfied). Where the Board of Supervisors recommends denial
of the demolition permit, the Board of Supervisors shall state the recommended
measures for the preservation or adaptive use of the historic resource. The Board of
Supervisors shall state the reasons why a demolition permit was approved or denied.
The applicant's failure to comply with any requirement of this section shall be sufficient
reason for a Board recommendation of denial of a demolition permit and denial of the
permit by the Zoning Officer. Such permit approval or denial action shall be taken by the
Zoning Officer within 10 days after the decision of the Board of Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors may recommend denial of a demolition permit for an historic
resource if the applicant does not demonstrate, through the financial analysis or
otherwise, that the sale or rental of the historic resource cannot provide a reasonable rate
of return and that other potential uses of the property authorized by the Zoning
Ordinance, and specifically this section, which would provide a reasonable rate of return,
are not possible.
Documentation required. Prior to issuance of the demolition permit, the Township may
require that the applicant/owner document the historic resource proposed for demolition.
Such documentation may include photographs, floor plans, measured drawings,
archeological survey or other form of documentation necessary to adequately record the
history and architectural features of the historic resource. The Township may also require
that the applicant/owner remove, preserve, and donate to the Township exterior and
interior architectural features or elements of the historic resource.
Appeal. Appeal of any action of the Zoning Officer under this section shall be to the
Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with applicable provisions of the Municipalities
Planning Code and the Zoning Ordinance.
Enforcement.
Remedies, fines and penalties. Any person who violates the requirements of this section
shall be subject to the remedies, fines and penalties imposed under this ordinance in
accordance with §§ 1002 and 1003, as well as those fines and penalties imposed under
the Township Building Code.
The Board of Supervisors may withhold issuing any building permits for a minimum of
one year from the date of application for the permit for a property where an historic
resource was located that was demolished in violation of this section.
Standards for rehabilitation.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation. Any proposed rehabilitation, alteration,
or enlargement of a Class 1 and 2 historic resource should be in substantial compliance with
the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior's most recent "Standards for
Rehabilitation." The Standards for Rehabilitation from a 2011 Department of the Interior
publication titled such are listed below:
A property will be used for its intended historic purpose or be placed in a new use that
requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment.
The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features, and spaces that characterize a property will be
avoided.
Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its times, place and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural

features or architectural elements from other buildings, will not be undertaken.
Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance
in their own right will be retained and preserved.
Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship
that characterize an historic property will be preserved.
Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the
old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence. Should replacement or repair costs be prohibitive, a reasonable
facsimile may be approved.
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, will be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
Significant archeological resources affected by a project will be protected and preserved
in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and will be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a
manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be unimpaired.
Compliance. Final determinations of compliance with these standards shall be made by the
Board of Supervisors.
Historic resource impact study.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Applicability. An historic resource impact study, or any applicable portions thereof, may be
required, unless waived or modified, by the Board of Supervisors or Zoning Hearing Board
when any of the following are proposed:
Subdivision or land development plans which will lead to the new construction of
buildings, structures, roads, driveways, parking areas, etc., adjoining an historic
resource, whether on the same or adjacent property.
Subdivision or land development plans which propose adaptive reuse or demolition, in
whole or part, of an historic resource.
General bridge or road construction or substantial repair adjoining an historic resource
whether on the same or adjacent property.
When required, the historic resource impact study shall be prepared by a qualified
professional in historic preservation, historical architecture, planning or related disciplines and
should contain the following background information, if not otherwise provided by the
applicant, including such items as: a site description, classification and general description,
photographs, and narrative description of the historical development of all historic resources
located on the subject tract. Any proposed change, including a general description of project

with time table or phases, if known, and measures to mitigate any impacts. The applicant
shall implement the mitigative measures proposed in the study.
Special use provisions.
[Added 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Additional use opportunities. In addition to the uses permitted by right, special exception, or
conditional use in the zoning districts specified in Article 5 of the Zoning Ordinance, historic
resources may be entitled to the additional use opportunities shown below. These use
opportunities shall be available in addition to any use currently being made of the property
where the historic resource is located, subject to the standards and procedures contained in
applicable sections of this chapter and the additional requirements set forth below. The
additional use must be located within a building which is designated as an historic resource.

Design standards. The following design standards shall apply, except where specifically noted
to the contrary in the subsections below, to any of the additional use opportunities specified in
§ 612.7.a above. Compliance with all other sections of this chapter, including, in particular,
"Screening" (§ 608), "Lighting" (§ 615), "Off-street parking and loading" (§ 607) and "Signs"
(§ 606), shall be required as applicable.
Buildings may not be enlarged for residential conversions. For the remaining additional
use opportunities shown in § 612.7.a, no historic resource may be enlarged on the sides
of the structure beyond what is minimally necessary to accommodate the additional use
and permitted by the applicable zoning district. As a guideline, no historic resource
should be enlarged by more than 50% of its existing footprint to utilize these
opportunities.
Unless otherwise specified in § 612.7.c through g hereinbelow, any rehabilitation,
alteration, or enlargement of an historic resource to utilize the opportunities listed in
§ 612.7.a should be in substantial compliance with the standards contained in § 612.5.a.
Plans for any rehabilitation, alteration or enlargement deemed necessary by the applicant
to utilize any of the opportunities listed in § 612.7.a shall be submitted to the Zoning
Officer for review with the building permit, conditional use, special exception or land
development application as applicable. Such plans shall be in sufficient detail to allow the
Township to determine the plan's level of compliance with the standards contained in
§ 612.5.a.
Within the applicable time period prescribed for final Township decisionmaking, the
Zoning Officer shall review the plans for compliance with the standards and guidelines in
§ 612.5.a and shall submit his/her findings in a written report to the applicant. The report
shall indicate what specific changes in the plans are necessary to bring them into
substantial compliance.
In any case where the proposed use is permitted only as a conditional use, as provided
in § 612.7.a, the Board of Supervisors, may deny the request for additional use or uses
where it determines that the degree of noncompliance with the standards and guidelines
in § 612.5.a is unacceptable and destructive to the integrity of the historic resource.
Where the additional use opportunity listed in § 612.7.a is available only by conditional
use, landscaping must be provided in accordance with § 612.9. In residential districts,
utilization of an additional use opportunity specified in § 612.7.a requires compliance with
the standards in §§ 602.1 and 603.
Home occupations. In conjunction with the residential use of a property, a home occupation
may be located in any historic resource on a particular property, but there shall be no more
than one home occupation per structure. In addition to the standards for home occupations
contained in § 602 and the general design standards in § 612.7.b, home occupations placed
in historic resources must comply with these additional requirements:
Any rehabilitation, alteration or enlargement of an historic resource (other than the
principal dwelling) to accommodate the home occupation must be in substantial
compliance with the standards contained in § 612.5.a.
Restaurant, tearoom, cafe, confectionery. As specified in § 612.7.a, a restaurant, tearoom,
cafe, or confectionery may be located in an historic resources by conditional use, provided the
following are adhered to in addition to those standards in § 612.7.b.
In a residential district, the historic resources must be located on a lot not less than four

Integrity of historic setting.
The subdivision or land development of a lot that contains an historic resource shall be
accomplished in such a manner that the resulting lot that will contain the resource is large
enough to preserve the integrity of the historic setting of the resource. A goal of the Township
shall be to preserve outbuildings, significant site features and immediate yard areas
significant to the resources on the lot with the resource.
The size and configuration of the subdivided lot shall depend upon the class of the historic
resource and the natural characteristics and the landscaping of the subdivided lot and
adjacent lots. Lot boundaries shall, in general, conform to the lines of identifiable natural
features, including landscaping, topography, geology, lot configuration, etc., on the site. Site
development shall be based, in general, upon § 612.5. Review and recommendations
regarding the resource, its subdivided lot, and the proposed land developments may be made
by the Zoning Officer to the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The Board
may require that a lot size be increased above the minimum lot size for the underlying zoning
district in which the resource is located.
Landscaping.
Applicability. In addition to applicable buffering requirements under § 608 of this ordinance, a
landscape plan for the grounds surrounding an historic resource may be required by the
Board of Supervisors when a tract proposed for subdivision or land development contains an
historic resource and when such historic resource is proposed for use by conditional use.
Landscape plan. The plan must be prepared by a landscape architect or a qualified nursery
and show all pertinent information, including the location, size and species of all individual
trees and shrubs to be planted or preserved. Through screening, buffering and selection of
plant material, the plan should strive to protect the integrity of the setting, including any
historic plant material.
Review by Zoning Officer. The landscape plan will be reviewed for appropriateness and effect
by the Zoning Officer within the applicable time periods prescribed for Township
decisionmaking on the application. The Zoning Officer shall set forth his/her comments in a
written report.
Residential open space option and planned single-family development.
[Added 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
In developments proposing to use the residential open space option and planned singlefamily
development in accordance with §§ 609 and 613, one additional lot may be created in
excess of the maximum number of lots otherwise permissible under the terms of this chapter
where such lot will contain an historic resource to be preserved as part of the development
plan.
§ 613. Planned single-family development.
Purpose. The intent of this provision is to allow for the high quality lot layout, planning and
landscape design for single-family residential subdivision in the R-1 District, where, in exchange
for the provision of common open space, the required area and dimensional specifications shall be

Open space.
A minimum of 15% of open space shall be provided.
The nature, extent, location and use of common open space shall be subject to approval by the
Board of Supervisors and shall, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:
There shall be governing documents for the development that include provisions which insure
that the common open space land shall continue as such and be properly maintained in
accordance with an approved open space management plan as described in § 617. These
provisions shall be in a form acceptable to the Board of Supervisors. The developer shall
either:
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Dedicate such land to public use of the Township or other public agency that has
indicated it will accept such dedication;
Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the ownership and maintenance
of the common open space; or
Other arrangement agreeable to both the developer and Board of Supervisors.
Common open space shall not be merely leftover or unusable land; it must be usable and
accessible for either active or passive recreation. Common open space must remain in its
natural condition unless designed for active or passive recreation as delineated on the
approved subdivision plan.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Common open space areas will be suitably landscaped either by retaining existing natural
cover and wooded areas or by an approved comprehensive landscape plan prepared by a
registered landscape architect and submitted with the preliminary and final plans, designed to
improve open space areas through planting and other means in such a way that future
maintenance costs are minimized.
[Amended 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
The minimum size of any single parcel of open space shall be three acres except that at the
discretion of the Supervisors, a smaller parcel shall be permitted if such smaller parcel is
necessary for an improved site design or for topographic reasons. Further, the location, shape
and topography of the open space shall be subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors
and such land shall be in an acceptable condition before any building permit is issued for the
next phase of development.
Sidewalks and streets.
Subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors, minimum cartway width may be reduced on
culs-de-sac if:
Vehicular traffic has been suitably separated from pedestrian traffic.
Such reduction in cartway width allows for the passage of two vehicles in opposite
directions with due allowance for any on-street parking that may be permitted on the culde-
sac.
Adequate off-street parking has been provided in sufficient quantity to warrant such
reduction. This shall be accomplished by creating a driveway that accommodates
vehicles side by side.

615.3
To establish minimum standards for outdoor lighting to:
Provide lighting in outdoor public places where public health, safety and welfare are
potential concerns.
Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of nonvehicular light sources that shine
into their eyes and thereby impair safe traverse.
Protect neighbors and the night sky from nuisance glare and stray light from incorrectly
aimed, placed, applied, maintained or shielded light sources.
Promote energy-efficient lighting design and operation.
Protect and retain the intended visual character of the various Township venues.
Applicability.
Where required or permitted by the Zoning Ordinance or other Township ordinances or
requirements, outdoor lighting shall be provided for safety and personal security in areas of
public assembly and traverse; including but not limited to the following: multifamily residential,
commercial, industrial, public-recreational and institutional uses.
The Board of Supervisors may require lighting to be incorporated for other uses or locations,
as it deems necessary.
The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to lighting in all above-mentioned uses
as well as, but not limited to, sign, architectural, landscaping and residential lighting.
Temporary seasonal decorative lighting is exempt from all but the glare-control and other
safety requirements of this ordinance.
Emergency lighting, as may be required by any public agency while engaged in the
performance of its duties, is exempt from the requirements of this ordinance.
If, in the judgment of the Board of Supervisors, the International Green Construction Code
(IGCC) negatively impacts the health, safety, and welfare of this ordinance, the requirements
of adjoining or nearby properties or the general public.
Criteria.
Illumination levels.
Lighting, where required by this ordinance, shall have intensities and uniformity ratios in
accordance with the current recommended practices of the Illuminating Engineering
Society of North America (IES) as contained in the current IES Lighting Handbook or
recommended practices.
Lighting fixture design.
Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the lighting application and
aesthetically acceptable to the Board of Supervisors.
For lighting predominantly horizontal tasks, such as roadways, pathways, vehicular and
pedestrian passage areas, merchandising and storage areas, automotive-fuel-dispensing
facilities, automotive sales areas, loading docks, cul-de-sacs, active and passive
recreational areas, building entrances, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian paths, site
entrances, and parking areas, fixtures shall meet IES full cutoff criteria or fully
shielded criteria. Fixtures with an aggregate lamp output not exceeding 500 lumens,

e.g., the rated output of a nondirectional forty-watt incandescent or ten-watt compact
fluorescent lamp, are exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
For predominantly non-horizontal surfaces, the use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wallmounted
fixtures, decorative globes and other fixtures not meeting IES full cutoff or
fully shielded criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the Board of
Supervisors or its designee, based upon acceptable glare control. Fixtures with an
aggregate lamp output not exceeding 500 lumens, e.g., the rated output of a nondirectional
forty-watt incandescent or ten-watt compact fluorescent lamp, are exempt
from the requirements of this subsection.
Fixtures shall be equipped with or be capable of being back-fitted with light directing
devices such as shields, visors or hoods when necessary to redirect offending light
distribution.
Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this ordinance, on private, residential,
commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational or institutional property, shall be aimed,
located, designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or
pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse, i.e., disabling glare, and so as not
to create a nuisance by projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use
or property, i.e., nuisance glare.
Floodlights and spotlights, when permitted, shall be so installed or aimed that they do not
project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, directly
skyward or onto a roadway.
Parking facility and vehicular and pedestrianway lighting (except for safety and security
applications and all-night business operations), for commercial, industrial and institutional
uses shall be automatically extinguished no later than 1/2 hour after the close of business
or facility operation. When safety or security lighting is proposed for after-hours
illumination, it shall not be more than 25% of the number of fixtures or illumination level
required or permitted for illumination during regular business hours. When it can be
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township that an elevated security risk exists,
e.g., a history of relevant crime, an appropriate increase above the 25% limit may be
permitted.
Fixtures shall be automatically controlled through the use of a programmable controller
with battery power-outage reset, which accommodates daily and weekly variations in
operating hours, annual time changes, and seasonal variations in hours of darkness
operation. The use of photocells is permitted when in combination with the programmable
controller to turn fixtures on at dusk and also for all-night safety/security dusk-to-dawn
fixture operation when such lighting is specifically approved by the Township. The use of
motion detectors is permitted as long as the fixture extinguishes after two minutes of the
initial illumination.
Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for controlling
glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily through the use of such means as
cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of fixture mounting height,
wattage, aiming angle and fixture placement.
The illumination projected from any use onto a residential use shall at no time exceed 0.1
footcandle, measured at line-of-sight at any time and from any point on the receiving
residential property.
Except as permitted for certain recreational lighting and permitted elsewhere in this §
615.3.c(7), fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of 20 feet of finished grade of the

surface being illuminated. Fixtures not meeting full cutoff criteria when their use is
specifically allowed by the Township shall not be mounted in excess of 16 feet above
finished grade. Mounting height shall be defined as the distance from the finished grade
at the base of the fixture to the optical center of the fixture. Where parking lots consist of
100 or more contiguous spaces, the Township may, at its sole discretion, based partially
on mitigation of off-site impacts, allow a fixture mounting height not to exceed 25 feet
above finished grade. For recreational lighting maximum mounting height requirements,
refer to § 615.5 of this ordinance.
Only the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania flags shall be permitted
to be illuminated past 11:00 p.m. Flag lighting sources shall not exceed 7,000 aggregate
lamp lumens per flagpole. The light source shall have a beam spread no greater than to
illuminate the flag and shall be shielded so the light source (lamp or reflector) is not
visible at normal viewing angles of the flag.
Under-canopy lighting for such applications as gas/service stations, hotel/theater
marquees, fast-food/bank/drugstore driveups shall be accomplished using flat-lens, fullcutoff
fixtures aimed straight down and shielded in such a manner that the lowest opaque
edge of the fixture shall be below the light source and its light-directing surfaces, at all
lateral angles around the fixture. The average maintained illumination in the area directly
below the canopy shall not exceed 20 initial footcandles, with no value exceeding 30
footcandles.
Fixtures used for architectural lighting, e.g., facade, fountain, feature and landscape
lighting, shall be designed, fitted and aimed so as not to project their output beyond the
objects intended to be illuminated.
Installation.
Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run underground, not overhead.
Poles supporting fixtures for the illumination of parking areas and located within the
parking area or directly behind parking spaces, or where they could be hit by snow plows
or wide-swinging vehicles, shall be suitably protected by being placed a minimum of five
feet outside of paved areas or tire stops or placed on concrete pedestals at least 30
inches high above the pavement or suitably shielded by steel bollards or suitably
protected by other Township-approved means.
Maintenance.
Lighting fixtures and ancillary equipment shall be maintained so as always to meet the
requirements of this § 615.
Permitting; specifications. The lighting of new or existing signs, or the replacement of fixtures
for existing signs, whether from internal or exterior lighting source, shall require a building
permit and shall comply with all applicable requirements of this ordinance and the following
requirements:
Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall have fixtures mounted at the top of the
billboard or sign and aimed downward. The fixtures shall be designed, fitted and aimed to
shield the lamp and its reflective surfaces from direct off-site view and to place the light
output onto and not beyond the sign or billboard. Lighting shall be linear fluorescent
unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township that equal or superior
results with respect to glare, light trespass and light pollution control can be achieved
with an alternative source.
Channel letter signs shall have dimming capability to allow for adjustment of sign
brightness when required by the Township to accommodate local ambient conditions.

district or use, and shall not be located within 1,000 feet of an intersection, interchange or
traffic-merging lane. Except for time and weather signs, the digital message shall not be
permitted to change more than once every 1/2 hour. During hours of darkness, the LED
output shall be automatically reduced to a brightness level that does not create glare, i.e.,
150 cd/m . The sign or billboard brightness shall be capable of being further dimmed if
the Township requires a reduction in brightness when the lighting is judged to be a
nuisance or hazard.
Residential development fixture placement.
If required streetlighting fixtures in residential developments shall be placed at the following
locations:
At the intersection of public roads with entrance roads to the proposed development.
Intersections involving proposed public or nonpublic major-thoroughfare road within the

[Added 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Required open space management plan.
Any application for conditional use approval for development requiring common open space in
accordance with this ordinance shall contain a conceptual open space management plan
providing for the long-term management of the common open space which is to be created as
part of the development, including maintenance and management of any stormwater
management, recreation, or any other common facilities which may be located within areas of
common open space. Such a plan shall include a narrative discussion of:
The manner in which the common open space and any facilities included therein will be
owned and by whom they will be managed and maintained;

617.2
The specific conservation and land management techniques and practices which will be
used to conserve and perpetually protect the common open space, including, for
example, stormwater management, where applicable, woodland stewardship planning,
anticipated mowing schedules, management of invasive vegetation, provision for
introduction of landscape materials, trail maintenance, recreation facilities, etc.;
The professional and personnel resources that will be necessary in order to maintain and
manage the common open space;
The nature of public or private access that is planned for the common open space and
the means by which such access shall be managed and/or controlled, as appropriate;
and
The source(s) and approximate amounts of funding that will be available for such
management, preservation and maintenance on a perpetual basis.
As required in § 617.1.a above, where an application for conditional use approval is submitted
prior to preliminary plan submission, such application shall include a conceptual open space
management plan outlining compliance with the issues stated above. The adequacy and
feasibility of this conceptual management plan as well as its compatibility with the open space
resource protection objectives of the Township shall be a factor in the approval or denial of
the conditional use application by the Board of Supervisors. A complete final open space
management plan shall be submitted with preliminary subdivision and land development plan
submission.
The Board of Supervisors may require that the open space management plan be recorded in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Chester County with the home association document
submitted with the final subdivision and land development plans. In addition, the Board may
require, as a condition of land development approval, that appropriate management contracts
be established as evidence of the ability to adhere to the provisions of the approved
management plan.
In order to allow for the changing needs inherent in the perpetual management of land, the
open space management plan shall contain a provision to the effect that it may be changed
by written application to the Board of Supervisors. Approval of such application by the Board
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, so long as the proposed change is feasible
and consistent with the purposes of preservation of open space set forth in this ordinance and
so long as the plan for such change avoids a likelihood of the obligation for management and
maintenance of the land falling upon the Township without the consent of the Board of
Supervisors.
Provisions for default of open space maintenance. Upon default by any owner, homeowners'
association, conservation organization, or other entity responsible for maintenance of designated
open space and/or associated facilities, where such maintenance is required under the terms of
the open space management plan, homeowners' association or condominium documents, any
subdivision and/or land development plan for the property, the zoning approval for the property, or
under any applicable requirements of any Township ordinances, permits or approvals, or where
such maintenance is otherwise necessary to abate a nuisance, emergency, hazard or other
condition threatening persons or property or the public health, safety or welfare, the Township
may, but shall not be obligated to, take the following actions:
Upon 30 days' advance written notice to the person, association or entity responsible for such
maintenance (or any such lesser period as may be specified in the notice in instances of
emergency) and the failure of the responsible individual, entity or association within such
thirty-day period (or such lesser period in the event of an emergency) to perform the
necessary maintenance and otherwise remedy the condition set forth in the Township's
notice, to enter upon the open space, accessing the same through any other lands of such

entity, association or individual as may be necessary, to perform such maintenance and take
any other action necessary to correct the condition provided in the Township's notice.
Any and all costs incurred by the Township in connection with such notice and maintenance
shall be paid by the responsible individual, entity or association within 10 days after written
demand by the Township. Upon failure of the responsible entity, association or individual to
pay such costs by the time required, there shall be added thereto interest at the rate of 15%
per annum as well as all costs incurred by the Township in collection thereof.
All such costs of maintenance, remediation, notices and collection, including court costs
and attorneys' fees, shall constitute a municipal lien and shall be enforceable as such
against the responsible entity, individual or association.
Such lien shall apply to all property of such individual, entity or association within the
development containing the affected open space.
In the case of an association or if individual lot owners are individually or collectively
responsible for maintenance of common open space, such lien shall apply, pro rata,
against all lot owners who are members of the association, in addition to applying to the
affected open space.
§ 618. Steep slope standards.
[Added 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Intended purposes:
To promote the public health, safety and welfare by the protection of steep slope areas and by
encouraging the retention of open space located and designed so as to constitute a
harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of Uwchlan Township.
To permit only those uses of steep slope areas which are compatible with the conservation of
natural conditions and which maintain stable soil conditions by:
Minimizing disturbances to vegetative ground covers; and
Restricting the regrading of steep slope areas.
To limit soil erosion and the resultant destruction of the land, siltation of streams, and damage
to the property of individuals.
To protect low-lying areas from flooding by limiting the increase in stormwater runoff caused
by grading of slope areas, changes of ground cover, or the erection of structures.
To maintain the ecological integrity and habitat value of steeply sloped areas, i.e., indigenous
vegetation and wildlife, which could be adversely affected by otherwise permitted
disturbances.
To allow the continuing replenishment of groundwater resources and the maintenance of
springs.
General provisions.
Compliance. No area within the steep slope shall hereafter be disturbed or used without full
compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
Steep slope overlay concept. Steep slopes shall be deemed to be an overlay zoning district
on any zoning district(s) now or hereafter enacted to regulate the use of land in Uwchlan
8/17/2020 Township of Uwchlan, PA Ecode360

Township.
Steep slopes shall have no effect on the permitted uses in the underlying zoning district,
except where said uses are intended to be located within the boundaries of either
precautionary or prohibitive slopes, as defined herein, and said uses are in conflict with
the permitted uses set forth in this section.
The requirements of §§ 618.3, 618.4 and 618.5 shall supersede the use and disturbance
requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) for areas where the steep slope overlay
applies.
Should the steep slope boundaries be revised as a result of legislative or administrative
actions or judicial decision, the zoning requirements applicable to the area in question
shall revert to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) without consideration
of this section.
For any parcel or any part thereof on which steep slope is an overlay, should the zoning
classification(s) be changed as a result of legislative or administrative actions or judicial
decision, such change(s) in classification shall have no effect on the boundaries of the
steep slope, unless an amendment to said boundaries was included as part of the
proceedings from which the subsequent change(s) originated.
Preservation of other restrictions. It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
Municipal liability. The granting of a zoning permit or approval of a subdivision or land
development plan within or near steep slope shall not constitute a representation, guarantee,
or warranty of any kind by Uwchlan Township, or by any official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of the proposed use and shall create no liability upon Uwchlan
Township, its officials or employees. This section does not imply that areas outside the steep
slope boundaries or land uses permitted within said district will always be totally free from the
adverse effects of erosion.
Designation and interpretation.
Steep slope consists of two areas which are delineated and defined as follows:
Precautionary slopes are those land areas of 15% to 25% slope measured over three or
more adjacent two-foot contour lines established from a current survey. For land where
construction, development or improvement is not proposed, other survey or GIS data
may be permitted by the Township at its discretion. Areas less than three adjacent
contour intervals and less than 1,000 square feet in area as shown in plan view shall be
excluded, provided that they do not adjoin or abut larger areas of precautionary slopes or
prohibitive slopes on the subject lot or development plan.
Prohibitive slopes are those of greater than 25% slope measured over three or more
adjacent two-foot contour lines established from a current survey. For land where
construction, development or improvement is not proposed, other survey or GIS data
may be permitted by the Township at its discretion. Areas less than three adjacent
contour intervals and less than 1,000 square feet in area as shown in plan view shall be
excluded, provided that they do not adjoin or abut larger areas of precautionary slopes or
prohibitive slopes on the subject lot or development plan.
Man-made slopes are not regulated by this section.
Delineation. The applicant shall delineate the two categories of steep slopes (precautionary
and prohibitive) that are on the site in accordance with the site analysis plans required by

Interpretation and appeals procedure.
Each application for construction or land disturbance within the precautionary slope
and/or prohibitive slope shall be submitted in accordance with § 618.5. Any areas of
precautionary slope and/or prohibitive slope that falls within the subject lot or lots shall be
interpolated and shown on the site plan required under § 618.5 through shading of such
area or areas.
Where an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the slope boundaries in
relation to a given parcel, an initial determination shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
Any party seeking such a determination may submit a topographic survey of the property
and any other pertinent documentation for consideration. The Zoning Officer shall make a
written report of the results of his initial determination, a copy of which shall be provided
to the Board of Supervisors.
Any party aggrieved by any such determination of the Zoning Officer, or other decision or
determination under this section, may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The party
contesting the location of the boundary shall have the burden of proof in case of any such
appeal.
Resource protection standards.
Steep slope areas shall be preserved in their natural state whenever possible. Where
permitted and where construction of roads, buildings, structures, driveways or infrastructure
cannot be avoided, disturbance shall be kept to the minimum necessary, and in no case shall
it exceed the following permitted disturbance limits:
Precautionary slopes. The disturbance permitted on precautionary slopes shall be limited
to the following activities:
Any structure permitted by right, special exception or conditional use according to
the terms of the underlying base zoning district.
Any road necessary to provide primary access to a use permitted by this ordinance,
when no practical alternative exists in an area of lesser slope.
All utilities where approved by the Township and all other regulatory agencies.
Parks and outdoor passive recreational uses, consistent with the goals of watershed
protection, as established in this ordinance, the Township Subdivision and Land
Development, and the Township Comprehensive Plan, as amended.
Tree farming, forestry, and other agricultural uses when conducted in conformity with
accepted conservation practice, including minimum tillage methods, and as may be
approved by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Chester
County Conservation District. Woodland management assistance is available
through the Pennsylvania Forest Stewardship Program administered by the
Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry.
Access roads for the passage of emergency vehicles in the event of fire or accident.
Accessory uses (except swimming pools) necessary for the operation and
maintenance of the above permitted uses.

Prohibitive slopes. No more than 15% of prohibitive slopes on the entire property
proposed for development shall be regraded, cleared, built upon, or otherwise altered or
disturbed. In addition, the disturbance permitted on prohibitive slopes shall be limited to
the following activities:
Parks and outdoor passive recreational uses consistent with the goals established in
this ordinance, the Township Subdivision and Land Development, and the Township
Comprehensive Plan, as amended.
Logging and woodcutting, where such activity is limited to highly selective removal of
trees. Maximum precautions shall be taken to avoid destruction of or injury to
desirable understory vegetation and remaining trees. Clear-cutting or grubbing of
trees is not permitted on prohibitive slopes. Woodland management assistance is
available through the Pennsylvania Forest Stewardship Program administered by the
Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry.
Grading for the minimum portion of a road or driveway necessary for access to the
principal use and all utility lines where approved by the Township and all other
regulatory agencies, when it can be demonstrated that no other routing is feasible.
Yard area(s) of a building where such building is not within the prohibitive slope.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 618.4.a(2) above, a use or structure existing at the
time of adoption of this section on any lot of one acre or less that contains prohibitive
slope as defined herein may be expanded into the prohibitive slopes, subject to
compliance with the resource protection standards of § 618.4.b through h, the application
procedures of § 618.5, and the approval of the Township Engineer.
An earthmoving plan of the property shall be provided that indicates existing grades with
contour lines at two-foot intervals and proposed grades within the area of any proposed
activity, disturbance, or construction, including the proposed location of all buildings and
structures. All areas of prohibitive and/or precautionary slopes shall be shaded accordingly.
Each building or structure shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide the least
alteration necessary of the existing grade, vegetation and natural soils condition.
New roads and improvements to existing roads should be designed within the existing
contours of the land to the extent possible and strive for compatibility with the character of
rural roads to prevent excessive cuts and fills.
In special protected watersheds, all stockpiles of earth shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized
immediately to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer. In all nonprotected watersheds, all
stockpiles of earth intended to be stored for more than 21 days shall be seeded or otherwise
stabilized to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer. Any disturbed area of prohibitive
slopes or any cut and fill resulting in slopes of greater than 3:1 shall be protected with an
erosion control blanket.
Any disturbance of land shall be in compliance with the erosion and sedimentation control
standards of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.[2]
An erosion and sedimentation control plan and soil stabilization plan shall be submitted
consistent with the requirements of § 510 of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
The plan shall demonstrate how soil will be protected from erosion during construction

shall be subject to review by the Fire Marshal or his designee. The necessary information
shall be submitted by the applicant to the Fire Marshal or his designee for his review.
§ 619. Woodland protection standards.
[Added 12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
Protection standards.
Disturbance limitations for woodlands and hedgerows.
Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, selective harvesting of
timber shall be permitted where undertaken in compliance with a timber harvesting plan
prepared by a qualified forester or equivalent professional and submitted to the Township
prior to commencement of any timber harvesting operation. Clear-cutting of any
woodland area shall be prohibited except to the minimum extent necessary to permit the
implementation of an approved land development or building permit in conformance with
8/17/2020 Township of Uwchlan, PA Ecode360

this section. Except for approved timber harvesting as provided above, all woodland
disturbance shall be subject to the following total disturbance limitations, regardless of
calculation of disturbance allowances for purposes of determining replacement planting
requirements:
Outside of areas designated as riparian buffer, permitted woodland disturbance on
any lot or tract shall not exceed 25% of the total area of any woodland(s) or
hedgerow(s). This limitation shall not apply within the PC, PC-2, and PI Districts.
Disturbance limitations shall be measured based on the extent of the subject
woodland at the time of initial submission of applicable application(s) after the
adoption of this section and shall be indicated on applicable plan(s). The 25%
disturbance limitation shall run with the land, once established. Subsequent
applications shall be subject to the initial determination of the 25% disturbance
limitations, regardless of intervening disturbance which may have occurred.
Disturbance of woodands on a lot or tract shall never exceed the 25% limitation
established by the initial application. If at any time within three years prior to an
applicable application there had existed a greater extent of woodland, such greater
area shall be utilized to calculate the extent of permitted woodland disturbance and
the limitations set forth herein.
Where disturbance to existing areas of woodlands exceeds any of the standards set forth
in § 619.1.a(1) above, woodland replacement shall be two shade trees of two-and-onehalf-
inch to three-inch caliper for each tree removed that is 12 inches dbh or greater.
Determination of the extent of woodland disturbance shall be as described in § 619.1.a(1)
herein.
Guidelines for determining permitted woodland disturbance. In determining where
permitted woodland disturbance will occur, the following factors shall be considered:
The applicant shall consider the location(s) and benefit of conservation of healthy
mature woodland stands.
Each building or structure shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide the
least alteration or disturbance necessary of the existing woodland. Clear-cutting shall
be minimized, trees shall be selectively removed, and a tree protection zone shall be
established.
In each situation where the standards of this section are applied, consideration shall
be given to balancing the benefits of woodland preservation with other valuable
resources on the site, including scenic views. The Township shall not unreasonably
restrict woodland disturbance where limited disturbance may permit siting of
buildings in less visually obtrusive areas of the tract.
The remaining undisturbed woodlands and other vegetation shall interconnect with
woodlands or wooded areas of adjacent properties to preserve continuous woodland
corridors and allow for the normal movement, dispersion, and migration of wildlife.
The applicant shall consider the impacts, in terms of functions and values to wildlife,
of separating, dividing or encroaching on wildlife travel corridors or extensive habitat
areas, especially woodlands exceeding 10 acres in area.
Protection of woodlands to remain on site. Woodlands, individual trees, and other
vegetation that are to remain on the site shall be identified on the plan and protected from
land disturbance and construction activities in accordance with the tree protection
provisions of § 512.1 of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.[1] In addition:
Reserved woodlands and hedgerows may be used to provide the vegetative screens
and buffers required by § 608 of this ordinance. Where necessary to meet the intent

and asked for permission to install the communications antenna(e) on an existing structure as
set forth in this subsection or demonstrate that the applicant cannot adequately extend or infill
its communication system through the use of these structures. Uwchlan Township would be
authorized, at no cost and/or rental fees, to install antenna and transmission cable equipment
on the tower for the Township and emergency use.
Abandonment.
If use of a wireless communications facility is abandoned or is not properly maintained
(so as to assure continued structural integrity and safety) or if the wireless
communications facility is not in use for a period of six months or longer, the owner shall
demolish and/or remove the wireless communications facility from the land site within six
months of such abandonment and/or nonuse. All costs of demolition and/or removal shall
be borne by the owner of the wireless communications facility. In the event the demolition
and/or removal referred to above is not performed in a timely manner, the owner shall be
subject to civil enforcement proceedings in accordance with § 1002 of this ordinance, and
other legal remedies available to the Township.
In addition, prior to the issuance of any building permit or use authorization or similar
municipal authorization which may result in construction or installation of a
communications antenna, communications antenna support structure (tower), or wireless
communications facility, a declaration of covenant must be submitted by the applicant,
and approved by the Board of Supervisors, for recording in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Chester County, by which the landowner, and his/her/its successors in interest,
authorize Township officials and Township designees to effectuate the disassembly,
demolishment and/or removal of any wireless communications facility antenna or similar
structure, as contemplated by this provision. Appropriate documentary proof must be
submitted to the Township staff, confirming the recording of the declaration of covenant,

Code, National Electrical Code, as well as the accepted and responsible workmanlike industry
practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors. Any tower-based WCF shall at all
times be kept and maintained in good condition, order and repair by qualified maintenance
and construction personnel, so that the same shall not endanger the life of any person or any
property in the Township.
Monopole design. All tower-based WCFs shall be monopoles.
Wind. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed to withstand the effects of wind according to
the standards designed by the American National Standards Institute as prepared by the
engineering departments of the Electronics Industry Association, and Telecommunications
Industry Association (ANSFEINTIA-222-E Code, as amended). Further, due to local weather
conditions, the tower-based WCF must be built to withstand one-hundred-mile-per-hour
sustained winds with a uniform loading of 50 pounds, or short duration gusts of up to 150
miles per hour. An independent professional engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall attest
to the proposed tower-based WCF structure's ability to meet this requirement and certify
proper construction of the foundation and erection of the tower.
Security. All tower-based WCFs shall have an integral security platform, or other means with
locked access, to prevent unauthorized climbing of the tower.
Maximum heights. No tower-based or nontower-based wireless communications facility shall
be taller than 120 feet measured from undisturbed ground level, unless the applicant proves
that another provider of wireless communications services has agreed to co-locate
communications antenna(e) on the applicant's communications antenna support structure or
the applicant demonstrates that a greater tower height is necessary to provide satisfactory
service for wireless communications. In such case, the communications antenna support
structure shall not exceed 150 feet unless the applicant secures approval as a condition of the
conditional use process from the Supervisors by demonstrating such proof as would be
required under § 806.4 of this ordinance. In no event shall mounted communications
antenna(e) height on any tower extend more than 25 feet above the installed height of the

tower. While evidence relating to the criteria set forth in § 806.4 of this Zoning Ordinance shall
be considered by the Board of Supervisors, the Board of Supervisors will impose reasonable
limitations on the admissibility of evidences sought to be introduced by any objecting party
seeking to question the need for any wireless communications facility (or component thereof).
The requirement of establishing a need for any such component and/or the height of any
proposed wireless communications support structure shall be deemed to be satisfied through
the submission of a report or testimony by a properly qualified radio frequency engineer
confirming that the installation of the proposed wireless communications facility will
substantially improve the provision of wireless communications service.
Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF shall interfere with public safety
communications or the reception of broadband, television, radio or other communication
services enjoyed by occupants of nearby properties. If measurable interference does result
from the installation and use of the tower-based WCF, the owner of the tower-based WCF
shall take appropriate measures to abate the interference or cease operation.
Maintenance and inspections. The following maintenance requirements shall apply:
Any tower-based WCF shall be fully automated and unattended on a daily basis and shall
be visited only for maintenance or emergency repair.
Proper maintenance shall be performed to ensure the upkeep of the facility in order to
promote the safety and security of the Township's residents.
At least annually the tower-based WCF and its appurtenances shall be inspected both
visually and with the appropriate nondestructive testing techniques. The results of those
tests and written certification of structural integrity by a registered professional engineer
shall be provided annually to the Township. Any structural faults thus noted will be
immediately corrected by the owner. Failure to provide proof of certified inspection is a
violation of this chapter and may subject the owner to the violations and penalties in
Section 1003 of this chapter.
[Amended 3-9-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-01]
Radio frequency emissions. No tower-based WCF may, by itself or in conjunction with other
WCFs, generate radio frequency emissions in excess of the standards and regulations of the
FCC.

not apply to direct broadcast satellite dishes installed for the purpose of receiving video and
related communications services at residential dwellings.
Removal and replacement. The removal and replacement of nontower WCPs and/or
accessory equipment for the purpose of upgrading or repairing the WCF is permitted, so long
as such repair or upgrade does not increase the overall size of the WCF or the numbers of
antennae.
Nontower wireless facilities in the rights-of-way. The following additional regulations shall apply
to all nontower wireless communications facilities located in the rights-of-way:
Co-location. Nontower WCFs in the ROW may only be co-located on existing poles, such as
existing utility poles or light poles.
Design requirements.
WCF installations located above the surface grade in the public ROW including, but not
limited to, those on streetlights and joint utility poles, shall consist of equipment
components that are no more than six feet in height and that are compatible in scale and
proportion to the structures upon which they are mounted. All ground-mounted
equipment shall be underground.
Antennae and all support equipment shall be treated to match the supporting structure.
WCFs and accompanying equipment shall be painted, or otherwise coated, to be visually
compatible with the support structure upon which they are mounted.
The height of the communications antenna(e) and apparatus attaching the antenna(e)
thereto shall not exceed 10 feet in height, unless the applicant obtains conditional use
approval for a greater antenna(e) height and demonstrates that such height is required to
make it an adequately functional component of the applicant's system, but in no case

Compensation for ROW use. In addition to permit fees as described above, every nontower
WCF in the ROW is subject to the Township's right to fix annually a fair and reasonable
compensation to be paid for use and occupancy of the ROW. Such compensation for ROW
use shall be directly related to the Township's actual ROW management costs including, but
not limited to, the costs of the administration and performance of all reviewing, inspecting,
permitting, supervising and other ROW management activities by the Township. The owner of
each nontower WCF shall pay an annual fee to the Township to compensate the Township for
its costs incurred in connection with the activities described above. The annual ROW
management fee for nontower WCFs shall be determined by the Township and authorized by
resolution of Township Board of Supervisors and shall be based on the Township's actual
ROW management costs as applied to such nontower WCF.
Time, place and manner. The Township shall determine the time, place and manner of
construction, maintenance, repair and/or removal of all nontower WCFs in the ROW based on
public safety, traffic management, physical burden on the ROW, and related considerations.
For public utilities, the time, place and manner requirements shall be consistent with the
police powers of the Township and the requirements of the Public Utility Code.
Equipment location. Nontower-based WCFs and accessory equipment shall be located so as
not to cause any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or to
otherwise create safety hazards to pedestrians and/or motorists or to otherwise
inconvenience public use of the ROW as determined by the Township. In addition:
All ground equipment associated with the tower shall be located underground so as not
to cause obstruction of the right-of-way.

§ 701. Statement of intent.
Within the zoning districts established by this ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto, there
exists or will exist certain nonconformities which, if lawful before this ordinance was passed or
amended, may be continued, subject to certain limitations, although such nonconformities would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or subsequent amendments
thereto.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in the ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building or structure on which actual construction was lawfully
begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and on which actual
building construction is completed within two years after such date
§ 702. Nonconforming lots of record.
In any district, structures and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided
that yard dimensions and requirements, other than those applying to area or width, or both, shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements
shall be obtained only through action of the Zoning Hearing Board.
If two or more lots, combination of lots and portion of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership
are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not
meet the requirements established for lot width and/or area, the land involved shall be considered to

be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and or area requirements established by
this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area below the
requirements stated in this ordinance.
§ 703. Nonconforming uses of land.
Lawful uses of land, which at the effective date of this ordinance or as a result of subsequent
amendments thereto become nonconforming and where such use involves no individual structure or
building with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000 may be continued by the present or any
subsequent owner so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
Extension. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was owned or leased by the user at the effective date of adoption of
such amendment of this ordinance.
Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of six
consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished unless a certificate of intention
as per § 709 has been filed. Any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance.
Changes or moving of use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, shall not
thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may, by special
exception, be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Zoning Hearing Board
shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate in the zoning district
than the existing nonconforming use.
Additional structures or buildings. No additional structures or buildings not conforming to the
requirement of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
§ 704. Nonconforming structures or buildings.
Structures or buildings which at the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto
become nonconforming by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the
lot, or other requirements concerning the building or structure, may be continued to be used so long as
such structure or building remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Enlargement. No such nonconforming structure or building may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease
its nonconformity.
Damage or destruction. A nonconforming structure which is accidentally destroyed or partially
destroyed by fire, explosion, or by any means to an extent of 75% or more of the market value
thereof immediately prior to such damage or destruction shall not be repaired or restored to a
nonconforming status, but shall be reconstructed and used only in conformity with the provisions
of this ordinance, unless the structure reconstruction is commenced within six months from date
the structure was damaged and shall be carried on without interruption.
Moving of structure or building. No nonconforming structure or building shall be, for any reason,
moved for any distance unless it shall thereafter conform to the zoning regulations for the district
in which it is located after it is moved.

Lawful uses of structures or buildings which at the effective date of this ordinance or as a result of
subsequent amendments thereto become nonconforming, may be continued by the present or any
subsequent owner so long as such use remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
Extension. A nonconforming use, other than a nonconforming home occupation or sign, may be
extended throughout any part of an existing structure or building, or a new extension may be
constructed, provided that any structural alterations, extensions or additions shall comply with all
provisions of this ordinance with respect to height, area, width, yard and coverage requirements
for the zoning district in which the structure or building is located. However, such extension of a
nonconforming use shall not exceed 50% of the gross floor area occupied by said nonconforming
use at the time such nonconforming use became nonconforming. Nonconforming home
occupations or adult entertainment use shall not be extended within the building or upon the lot on
which the nonconforming home occupation or adult entertainment use is located.
[Amended 9-14-1998 by Ord. No. 98-14]
Change of use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, shall not thereafter be
changed back to any nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, other than a nonconforming
home occupation or sign, may, by special exception, be changed to another nonconforming use,
provided that the Zoning Hearing Board shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate in the zoning district than the existing nonconforming use. No nonconforming
home occupation shall be changed to another nonconforming use.
Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or building or portion thereof has
been discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, such structure or building or portion
thereof shall not thereafter be reestablished, unless a certificate of intention as per § 709 has been
filed. Any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
Destruction. Removal or destruction of the structure or building in which a nonconforming use is
located shall eliminate the use of the land upon which the structure or building was erected for a
nonconforming use. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an
extent of 75% or more of the market value of the structure or building immediately prior to such
damage or destruction. However, if construction begins within six months after destruction or
partial destruction, the same nonconforming use may be reestablished. The Zoning Hearing Board
may, by special exception, authorize another equally appropriate or more appropriate use to be
reestablished.
Nonconforming signs.
All signs erected prior to the enactment of this ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto
which are not in conformity with the provisions thereof, shall be deemed nonconforming signs.

one year of the date of enactment of this ordinance.
Any replacement, reconstruction, alteration, extension or addition to a nonconforming sign,
including any alteration of the structural supports or mechanical facilities thereof, shall require
the prior issuance of a permit for the same from the Uwchlan Township Zoning Officer. No
such permit shall be issued unless the sign, as it is proposed to be replaced, reconstructed,
altered, extended or enlarged shall be in complete and strict conformity with all of the
provisions of this ordinance.

§ 706. Unsafe or unlawful structures or buildings.
If a nonconforming structure or building or portions thereof containing a nonconforming use becomes
physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by any duly
authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, such structure or building
shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located.
§ 707. Uses under special exception provisions not
nonconforming uses.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a zoning district under the terms of this ordinance
and which existed at the adoption of this ordinance (other than a change through Zoning Hearing
Board action from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use) shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use in such zoning district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming
use.
§ 708. Registration of nonconforming uses and structures or
buildings.
To facilitate the administration of this ordinance, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to prepare and
maintain an accurate listing of all nonconforming uses, structures, and buildings. Such a listing shall be
a matter of public record and shall constitute sufficient notice of the nonconforming status of said
property and the limitations therein expressed and implied to any transferee acquiring any right to use
or own such property.
§ 709. Certificate of intention.
A certificate of intention shall be required in all instances where a nonconforming use of land or
nonconforming use of a structure or building is discontinued if the owner or operator of such uses
desires to maintain such a nonconforming use.
The Zoning Officer shall maintain proper forms for the registration of any certificate of intention.
It shall be incumbent upon the owner or applicant to file such a form with the Zoning Officer. The
filing of such form shall be considered an administrative duty of the Zoning Officer, who shall not
refuse to accept the completed form.
The Zoning Officer shall maintain a separate file for all certificates of intention.
Each certificate of intention shall be valid for a period of one year unless extended by the Board
of Supervisors for a maximum of two additional terms of one year each. Failure to renew the
certificate of intention shall constitute an end of the nonconforming use status.

The recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be submitted in writing to the Board
of Supervisors.
At least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors shall submit the
proposed amendment to the Chester County Planning Commission for recommendation.
Within 30 days following enactment, a copy of the amendatory ordinance shall be forwarded
to the Chester County Planning Commission.
Proposed action shall not be taken until the Township Planning Commission and County
Planning Commission recommendation is made. Provided, however, that in the event the
Township Planning Commission and/or the County Planning Commission fail to provide the
Township with written recommendations within 30 days of submission of the proposed
amendment to said bodies, then the Board of Supervisors shall proceed without such
recommendation(s).
Landowner curative amendments.
A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the validity of an
ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or
development of land in which he has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the
Board of Supervisors with a written request that his challenge and proposed amendment
be heard and decided as provided in Section 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10916.1, as amended. The Board of Supervisors shall
commence a hearing thereon within 60 days of the request provided in Section 916.1 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The curative amendment and challenge
shall be referred to the planning agency or agencies as provided in § 805.1.a. and
805.1.c. hereof and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as provided in Section
610 and 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10610 and
10916.1. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with § 902 hereof and all
references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for the purposes of this section, be
references to the Board of Supervisors.
In consideration of the landowner's curative amendment, the Board of Supervisors shall
consider the plans and explanatory materials submitted by the landowner as well as the
following factors: the impact of the proposed amendment upon roads, sewer facilities,
water supply, schools and other public service facilities; if the proposal is for residential
use, the impact of the proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map; the suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's
soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of
the resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and the impact of
the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other land uses which are essential to
public health and welfare.
The landowner's request for a curative amendment is denied when:
The Board of Supervisors notifies the landowner that it will not adopt the
amendment; or
The Board of Supervisors adopts another amendment which is unacceptable to the
landowner; or
The Board of Supervisors fails to act on the landowner's request, in which event the
denial is deemed to have occurred on the 30th day after close of the last hearing on
the request on which day the request is deemed to be automatically denied by the

the landowner and the Township.
Procedure upon municipal curative amendments.
The Township, by formal action, may declare its Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof
substantively invalid and propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome such
invalidity. Within 30 days following such declaration and proposal the Board of
Supervisors shall:
By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity of the Zoning
Ordinance which may include:
References to specific uses which are either not permitted or not permitted in
sufficient quantity;
Reference to a class of use or uses which require revision; or
Reference to the entire ordinance which requires revisions.
Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to
correct the declared invalidity.
Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the Township shall enact
a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the validity of, the Zoning Ordinance
pursuant to the provisions required by Section 609 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10609, to cure the declared invalidity of the Zoning Ordinance.
Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in Subsection 805.1.f(1), the Board of
Supervisors shall not be required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative
amendment filed under § 805.1.e nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give
a report requested under Section 909.1 or 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. § 10909.1 or 10916.1, subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the
grounds identical to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution required by
Subsection 805.1.f.(1). Upon completion of the procedures as set forth in Subsections
805.1.f(1) and (2), no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of § 805.1.e of this
ordinance and 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code shall, from the date of the
declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of the unamended Zoning Ordinance for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this section.
The Township having utilized the procedures as set forth in Subsections (1) and (2) may
not again utilize said procedures for a thirty-six-month period following the date of the
enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the validity of its Zoning
Ordinance, pursuant to Subsection (2); provided, however, if after the date of declaration
and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed upon the Township
by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision,
the Township may utilize the provision of this section to prepare a curative amendment to
its ordinance to fulfill said duty or obligation.
Notice of hearing and amendment.
Before voting on the enactment of an amendment to this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors
shall, by resolution adopted at a stated or special meeting, fix the time and place of a public
hearing on the proposed amendment, which hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice. In
addition, if the proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map change, notice of the said public
hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Zoning Officer at points along the perimeter of
the tract sufficient to notify potentially interested citizens. Such posting shall be accomplished
at least one week prior to the date of the hearing.

§ 806. Conditional use.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the owner or his agent, the developer, or the
applicant for a conditional use approval from obtaining approval in accordance with the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, PRD Ordinance, or other applicable ordinances.
Application. Unless waived by the Board of Supervisors for good cause shown, an application for
a conditional use permit shall be accompanied by a proposed plan showing the size and location
of the proposed use, the location of all proposed buildings, and all proposed facilities, including
access drives and parking areas. All streets within 200 feet of the property shall be shown.
Procedures for review.
Application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Secretary of the Township on such
forms as may be prescribed for said purpose. The application shall be accompanied with a
fee as prescribed by the Board of Supervisors. The Secretary shall submit the application for
recommendation to the Planning Commission. Upon receipt of application and proposed site
plan when required, the Planning Commission shall review the conditional use request with
the applicant at its next regularly scheduled meeting or at a special meeting at the discretion
of the Planning Commission.
If the Planning Commission does not render a decision within 30 days from the date that the
application is forwarded, then it shall be deemed that the Planning Commission recommends
disapproval of the application.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
After review by the Planning Commission the Board of Supervisors shall hold a public hearing
giving notice as required by law. The public hearing shall be held within 60 days from date the
application was received. If after any public hearings the application is substantially amended
or changed, the Board of Supervisors shall hold another public hearing pursuant to public
notice. The vote on the conditional use shall be within 45 days after the last public hearing.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
Effect of conditional use approval. Any use for which a conditional use permit is granted shall be
deemed to be a conforming use in the zoning district in which such use is located.
Criteria to be used. The following criteria shall be used as a guide in evaluating a proposed
conditional use:

It shall be the applicant's burden to persuade the Board by substantial evidence that the
proposed use, when located on the property at issue, having all of the characteristics as
proposed, and considering the present (or proposed) development and use of neighboring
lands and the particular characteristics of the supporting public infrastructure, will not cause
negative impacts of a type or to a degree not usually associated with uses of the proposed
category located and operated in the usual manner.
The size, scope, extent, and character of the conditional use desired shall be consistent with
the spirit, purpose, and intent of this ordinance.
Consideration of the character and type of development in the area surrounding the location
for which the request is made, and a determination that the proposed change will constitute
an appropriate use in the area and will not injure or detract from the use of surrounding
properties or from the character of the neighborhood.
The proposed use at the location in question would be in the public interest and best serve
the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
Consideration of the effects of the proposed change with respect to the most appropriate use
of land; conserving building and property values; safety from fire, panic, and other dangers;
adequacy of light and air; adequacy of public and community services.
Submission of a fiscal impact study as follows:
With respect to any proposed use consisting of initially or in the aggregate five or more
residential dwelling units or lots, or 5,000 square feet of gross floor area or more than 10
parking spaces to be devoted to nonresidential uses, the developer shall submit as an
integral component of the conditional use application and the Board shall consider a
fiscal impact statement reporting the results of a study of the fiscal impact of the
proposed development on the Township of Uwchlan performed by a qualified
professional and projecting the primary costs that will be incurred by the Township and
the immediate revenues that will be generated to the Township as consequence of the
proposed development permitted by conditional use. The fiscal impact study and analysis
shall employ the Per Capita Multiplier Method in the case of proposed residential
development and the Case Study Method in the case of proposed nonresidential
development, as described in the most recent edition of the Practitioner's Guide to Fiscal
Impact Analysis published by the Center for Urban Policy Research. Demographic
information by housing type; average expenditures, including budgetary information and
operating costs, and estimates of excess or deficient service capacity and expected local
service responses, for use in the fiscal impact analysis shall be obtained from the
Township staff. Conditional use approval shall not be granted unless any demonstrated
adverse fiscal impact is proposed to be borne by the developer in the form of some
combination of contributions, payments in lieu of taxes, and/or the provision of off-site
public improvements and the developer offers in writing to accept a suitable condition to
approval requiring it to so bear the demonstrated adverse fiscal impact.
In lieu of the submission of a fiscal impact study as described in this subsection, a
developer may submit a written undertaking, in form satisfactory to the Township
Solicitor, to make an unrestricted contribution to the Township at the time of application
for building permits necessary to commence construction of the proposed development
and in an amount promulgated from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors.
The contributions and payments described in Subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall
be in addition to and shall not be offset by any voluntary contributions or donations of the
developer; on-site public or quasi-public improvements, including without limitation open
space lands and active or passive recreation facilities, utilities and utility easements, and
public or private roads; or improvements, whether on or off-site, necessary to implement

the development proposal, including, without limitation, access highway improvements,
including acceleration and deceleration lanes and traffic signals, access road widening,
utilities and utility easements.
All unrestricted monies received by the Township pursuant to Subsections (1) and (2)
above shall be maintained in a separate, interest bearing account (or alternative
investment instrument), shall be expended only for the purpose of ameliorating the
identified adverse fiscal impact of the developments concerning which the funds have
been contributed, and shall be the subject of an annual report to the Board by the
Township Secretary or Manager demonstrating compliance with this subsection.
Sufficient land area available to be able to effectively screen the proposed conditional use
from adjoining uses.
Sufficient safeguards such as parking, traffic control, screening, and setbacks can be
implemented to remove any potential adverse influences the use may have on adjoining uses.
The written notification of abutting property owners.
Uses shall meet the provisions and requirements of the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
Each applicant for conditional use approval shall establish the effect of the proposed
development on the reserve capacity or level of service of the public roads and road
intersections providing access to and in the area of the subject property. Conditional use
approval shall not be granted if the proposed development is predicted to have the effect of
materially increasing traffic congestion on the said roads or at the said road intersections.
Should the applicant fail to complete such construction or alteration within a twelve-month
period, the Board of Supervisors may, upon 10 days notice in writing, rescind or revoke the
granted conditional use or the issuance of the permit, or permits, or the other action
authorized to the applicant. If the Board of Supervisors finds that a good cause appears for
the failure to complete within such twelve-month period, an extension may be granted.
Each applicant for conditional use approval shall establish the effect of the proposed
development on the availability of reliable, safe and adequate public water supply and sewer
service to support the intended uses within the capacity of available water and sewer
resources. Conditional use approval shall not be granted if the proposed development is
predicted to have the effect of adversely affecting available public water and sewer service or
the applicant fails to demonstrate that public water and sewer service is available.
Each applicant for conditional use approval shall establish that the property is free of or has
been remediated of environmental contamination and/or hazardous materials or waste by
complying with §§ 402.f.8(e) and 511 of the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance. Conditional use approval shall not be granted without compliance with this
§ 806.4.n.
[Added 1-8-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-01]
Conditions and safeguards. In granting a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this ordinance, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Act 247 of July 31, 1968, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., as amended or revised, and this
ordinance. The amendment of these conditions is expressly prohibited unless the applicant
therefor establishes to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors by substantial evidence of
record that the proposed amendment is justified by a material change in circumstances incident to
the land itself.

and accept the decision or findings of the Hearing Officer as final.
The parties to the hearing shall be the Township, any person affected by the application who

45 days and the parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Board
prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later
than 30 days after the report of the Hearing Officer. Where the Board fails to render the
decision within the period required by this subsection, or fails to hold the required hearing
within 60 days from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in
writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor
of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as
hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from
the last day it could have met to render a decision. If the Board shall fail to provide such

thereon as provided in § 902. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all
contested questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall become part
of the record on appeal to the court.
Editor's Note: Sections 1003 and 1004 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code were

Unified appeals. When the Board has jurisdiction over zoning matters pursuant to §§ 903.1,
903.2 and 903.4, the Board shall also hear all appeals which an applicant may elect to bring
before it with respect to any Township ordinance or requirement pertaining to the same
development plan or development. In any such case, the Board shall have no power to pass upon
the non-zoning issues, but shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided in § 902. At
the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which
shall become part of the record on appeal to the court.
Variances.
To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance(s) from the terms of this ordinance
as will not be contrary to public interest, where a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. In granting any variance the Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this ordinance and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,[2] as
amended. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application and may require
preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant variance relief in proper
cases, including, without limitation, any case in which it is established to the satisfaction of the
Board that an effect of the zoning regulation at issue or challenged is to deprive the
landowner of a property or other right guaranteed or protected by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or United States Constitutions; and further provided the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size, or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship
is due to such conditions, and not circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant, subsequent to
the adoption of this ordinance, or prior ordinances, whether in violation of the provisions
hereof or not, and that such circumstances or conditions are such that strict application of
the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of
such land, structure, or building.
That for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, the granting of the variance is
necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted
by the Board is the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.

903.5
That any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the
adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent
with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which the subject
property is situated, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property.
That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structure, or building in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the granting of a variance.
That in no case shall a variance be granted solely for reasons of additional financial gain
on the part of the applicant.
That the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors shall not be infringed upon by action of
the Board in any matter which should appropriately be the subject for an amendment to
the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map. No variance shall be granted under this section to
allow a structure or use in a zoning district restricted against such structure or use.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
If a variance is granted, the necessary permit(s) shall be secured and the authorized action
begun within three months after the date when the variance is finally granted, and the building
or alteration, as the case may be, shall be completed within 12 months of said date. For good
cause the Board may, upon application in writing stating the reasons therefore, extend to six
months the three-month application period.
Should the applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within said six months' period or
having obtained the permit should he fail to commence work thereunder within such six
months' period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant or appellant has waived,
withdrawn, or abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances, and
permits granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the Board.
Special exceptions.
To hear and decide only such special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance upon which
the Board, by the provisions of this ordinance, is specifically authorized. The granting of a
special exception when specifically authorized by the terms of the ordinance shall be subject
to the following conditions:
Such use shall be one which is specifically authorized as a special exception use in the
zoning district.
Such special exception shall only be granted subject to any applicable condition and
safeguards as required by this ordinance.
Such special exception may be granted subject to additional reasonable conditions and
safeguards as may be deemed by the Board to be advisable and appropriate.
Such use shall not adversely affect the character of the zoning district, nor the
conservation of property values, nor the health and safety of residents or workers on
adjacent properties and in the general neighborhood.
Such use shall be of such size and so located and laid out in relation to its access streets
that vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from such use will not create undue
congestion or hazards prejudicial to the general neighborhood.
Such use shall not conflict with the direction of building development in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan or portion thereof which has been adopted by the Board of

Supervisors.
Each applicant for special exception shall establish the effect of the proposed
development on the reserve capacity or level of service of the public roads and road
intersections providing access to and in the area of the subject property. No special
exceptions shall be granted if the proposed development is shown to have the predicted
effect of materially increasing traffic congestion on the said roads or at the said road
intersections.
All applications for special exceptions shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its
review and recommendations. If the Planning Commission does not make any
recommendations within 30 days, it shall be deemed that the Planning Commission has
recommended approval of the application for special exception.
If a special exception is granted, the necessary permit(s) shall be secured within two years
after the date when the special exception is granted.
Should the applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within said two-year period, or
having obtained the permit should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two-year
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or applicant has waived,
withdrawn, or abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances and
permits granted to him be deemed automatically rescinded by the Board.
§ 904. Procedures for application to the Zoning Hearing Board.
The Board shall act in strict accordance with the procedure specified by Article IX of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and by this ordinance. All appeals and applications made
to the Board shall be in writing, on forms prescribed by the Board. Every appeal or application shall
refer to the specific provision of this ordinance involved and shall exactly set forth the interpretation
that is claimed, the grounds for any challenges to the validity of this ordinance, the use for which a
special exception is sought, or the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it
is claimed that the variance should be granted, as the case may be. In the event the procedures set
forth in this ordinance shall be in conflict with or contrary to the procedures set forth in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,[1] as amended, then and in such event the procedures set
forth in the latter shall prevail.
Applications and appeals together with the required filing fee, as established by the Board of
Supervisors, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Zoning Hearing Board.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 905. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 903 and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing
Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning
Hearing Board facts indicate that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case
the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may
be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on
petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or
limit the approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the applicant, the
applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post
bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. After the petition
is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the
hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant

for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court
determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond from an order of the court
dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate court sustains the order of the
court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and
after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs,
expenses, and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.

may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building,

Therefore, as provided in Section 621 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541, the LFA's
regulatory authority under Title VI of the Communications Act is not applicable to the construction,
installation, maintenance, or operation of the franchisee's FTTP Network to the extent the FTTP
Network is constructed, installed, maintained, or operated for the limited purpose of upgrading
and/or extending Verizon's existing telecommunications facilities for the provision of non-cable
services. This agreement shall not be construed to limit whatever regulatory authority LFA may
have under Title II, state, and local law with respect to the FTTP Network facilities.
Term. This franchise shall become effective on July 10, 2006 (the "effective date"). The term of this
franchise shall be 10 years from the effective date, with an automatic renewal of five years unless
the franchise is earlier revoked as provided herein.
Grant not exclusive. The franchise and the rights granted herein to use and occupy the public
rights-of-way to provide cable services shall not be exclusive, and the LFA reserves the right to
grant other franchises for similar uses or for other uses of the public rights-of-way, or any portions
thereof, to any person, or to make any such use themselves, at any time during the term of this
franchise. Any such rights which are granted shall not adversely impact the authority as granted
under this franchise and shall not interfere with existing facilities of the cable system or the
franchisee's FTTP Network.
Franchise subject to federal law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, this
franchise is subject to and shall be governed by all applicable provisions of federal law as it may

be amended, including but not limited to the Communications Act and implementing regulations,
and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the extent not in conflict with federal law.
No waiver:
The failure of the LFA on one or more occasions to exercise a right or to require compliance
or performance under this franchise or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance by the LFA, nor to
excuse the franchisee from complying or performing, unless such right or such compliance or
performance has been specifically waived in writing.
The failure of the franchisee on one or more occasions to exercise a right under this franchise
or applicable law, or to required performance under this franchise, shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of such right or of performance of this agreement, nor shall it excuse the
LFA from performance, unless such right or performance has been specifically waived in
writing.
Construction of agreement:
The provisions of this franchise shall be liberally construed to effectuate their objectives.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the scope or applicability of Section 625 of the
Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 545.
Should any change to state law have the lawful effect of materially altering the terms and
conditions of this franchise, then the parties shall modify this franchise to the mutual
satisfaction of both parties to ameliorate the negative effects on the franchisee of the material
alteration. Any modifications shall be in writing. If the parties cannot reach agreement on the
above-referenced modification to the franchise, then the franchisee may terminate this
agreement without further obligation to the LFA; provided, however, that the franchisee shall
be required to provide the LFA with written notice of such termination, with such termination to
take effect no sooner than 180 days after the provision of such notice, or at the franchisee's
option, the parties agree to submit the matter to binding arbitration in accordance with the
commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Police powers. Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prohibit the reasonable, necessary
and lawful exercise of the police powers of the LFA. However, if the reasonable, necessary and
lawful exercise of the police power results in any material alteration of the terms and conditions of
this franchise, then the parties shall modify this franchise to the mutual satisfaction of both parties
to ameliorate the negative effects on the franchisee of the material alteration. If the parties cannot
reach agreement on the above-referenced modification to the franchise, then the franchisee may
terminate this agreement without further obligation to the LFA; provided, however, that the
franchisee shall be required to provide the LFA with written notice of such termination, with such
termination to take effect no sooner than 180 days after the provision of such notice, or at the
franchisee's option, the parties agree to submit the matter to binding arbitration in accordance with
the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.
§ A270-3. Provision of cable service.
Service area.
Initial service area. The franchisee shall offer cable service to significant numbers of
subscribers in residential areas of the initial service area and may make cable service
available to businesses in the initial service area within 24 months of the service date of this
franchise, and shall offer cable service to all residential areas in the initial service area within
five years of the service date of the franchise, except: (A) for periods of force majeure; (B) for
periods of delay caused by LFA; (C) for periods of delay resulting from the franchisee's

inability to obtain authority to access rights-of-way in the service area; (D) in areas where
developments or buildings are subject to claimed exclusive arrangements with other
providers; (E) in developments or buildings that the franchisee cannot access under
reasonable terms and conditions after good faith negotiation, as determined by the
franchisee; and (F) in areas, developments or buildings where the franchisee is unable to
provide cable service for technical reasons or which require nonstandard facilities which are
not available on a commercially reasonable basis; and (G) in areas where the occupied
residential household density does not meet the density requirements set forth in Subsection
A(1)(a).
Density requirement. The franchisee shall make cable services available to residential
dwelling units in all areas of the service area where the average density is equal to or
greater than 30 occupied residential dwelling units per mile as measured in strand
footage from the nearest technically feasible point on the active FTTP Network trunk or
feeder line. Should, through new construction, an area within the initial service area meet
the density requirements after the time stated for providing cable service as set forth in
Subsection A(1) and (2), respectively, the franchisee shall provide cable service to such
area within six months of receiving notice from the LFA that the density requirements
have been met.
Additional service areas. Except for the initial service area, the franchisee shall not be
required to extend its cable system or to provide cable services to any other areas within the
franchise area during the term of this franchise or any renewals thereof. If the franchisee
desires to add additional service areas within the franchise area, the franchisee shall notify
the LFA in writing of such additional service area at least 10 days prior to providing cable
services in such areas.
Availability of cable service. The franchisee shall make cable service available to all residential
dwelling units and may make cable service available to businesses within the service area in
conformance with Subsection A, and the franchisee shall not discriminate between or among any
individuals in the availability of cable service. In the areas in which the franchisee shall provide
cable service, the franchisee shall be required to connect, at the franchisee's expense, all
residential dwelling units that are within 125 feet of trunk or feeder lines not otherwise already
served by the franchisee's FTTP Network. The franchisee shall be allowed to recover, from a
subscriber that requests such connection, the actual costs incurred for residential dwelling unit
connections that exceed 125 feet and actual costs incurred to connect any nonresidential dwelling
unit subscriber.
Cable service to municipal buildings. Subject to Subsection A, the franchisee shall provide,
without charge within the service area, one service outlet activated for expanded basic service to
one fire station, one police station, one emergency operations center, and one ambulance corps,
and one service outlet activated for basic service to each municipal building, public library, and
each public school, and each nonpublic school that (a) receives funding pursuant to Title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., and (b) is considered
a nonpublic, nonlicensed school under the Pennsylvania Private Academic Schools Act, 24 P.S.
§§ 6702-6721, located in the LFA, as may be designated by the LFA in Exhibit A;[1] provided,
however, that the franchisee shall not be obligated to provide any service outlets activated for
basic service to home schools; also provided, however, that if it is necessary to extend the
franchisee's trunk or feeder lines more than 125 feet solely to provide service to any such school
or municipal building, the LFA shall have the option either of paying the franchisee's direct costs
for such extension in excess of 125 feet or of releasing the franchisee from the obligation to
provide service to such school or other municipal building. Furthermore, the franchisee shall be
permitted to recover, from any school or other municipal building owner entitled to free service, the
direct cost of installing, when requested to do so, more than one outlet, or concealed inside wiring,
or a service outlet requiring more than 125 feet of drop cable; provided, however, that the
franchisee shall not charge for the provision of basic service to the additional service outlets once
installed. In addition to the locations designated in Exhibit A, the franchisee shall provide without

charge within the service area up to one service outlet activated for basic service to a maximum of
four additional municipal buildings during the term of the agreement at locations as mutually
agreed upon by the parties, subject to all conditions set forth in this Subsection C; provided,
however, that the franchisee shall not be required to provide any such service outlet if the location
of the additional municipal building resides in an area, development, or building where the
franchisee is unable to provide cable service for technical reasons or which require nonstandard
facilities which are not available on a commercially reasonable basis. Furthermore, the franchisee
shall not be required to provide any such additional service outlets until all cable operators
providing cable service in the franchise area also provide such additional service outlet(s) without
charge.
Editor's Note: Exhibit A is on file in the Township office.
§ A270-4. System facilities.
Technical requirement. The franchisee shall operate, maintain, test on a regular basis, construct
and extend the cable system so as to provide high quality signals and reliable delivery of cable
services for all cable programming services throughout the LFA over its FTTP Network. The cable
system shall meet or exceed any and all technical performance standards of the FCC; the
National Electrical Safety Code; the National Electric Code; and any other applicable federal laws,
as well as state and local laws or regulations, to the extent not in conflict with federal law and
regulations.
System characteristics. The franchisee's cable system shall meet or exceed the following
requirements:
The system shall be designed, constructed, and maintained with an initial analog and digital
carrier passband between 50 and 860 MHz.
The system shall be designed to be an active two-way plant for subscriber interaction, if any,
required for the selection or use of cable service.
Interconnection. The franchisee shall design its cable system so that it may be interconnected with
other cable systems in the franchise area. Interconnection of systems may be made by direct
cable connection, microwave link, satellite, or other appropriate methods.
Emergency alert system:
The franchisee shall comply with the Emergency Alert System ("EAS") requirements of the
FCC in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the system.
§ A270-5. PEG services.
PEG set-aside; interconnection:
In order to ensure universal availability of PEG programming within the geographic limits of
those municipalities that comprise the CCCG, the franchisee shall reserve on the basic
service tier up to one dedicated public access channel, one dedicated educational access
channel, and one dedicated government access channel ("PEG channels"); provided,
however, that the franchisee shall not be obligated to reserve the PEG channels until all cable
incumbents within the franchise area of at least one CCCG member jurisdiction similarly
reserve capacity for an equal number of PEG channels. The parties agree that the franchisee
shall retain the right to utilize all such reserved PEG channel capacity, in its sole discretion,
during the term of this franchise until such time that, and to the extent that, a CCCG member
jurisdiction or its designee: a) activates the PEG channels subject to Subsection A(2); or b)
ceases to use the PEG channels during the term for a period of more than one year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that the franchisee shall only be

https://ecode360.com/print/UW2708?guid=UW2708&children=true 608/620
(2)
(3)
(4)
obligated to provide a maximum of three PEG channels to be shared among all CCCG
member jurisdictions to the extent they are activated subject to Subsection A(2).
A CCCG member jurisdiction with a franchise from the franchisee or its designee may
activate any or all of the reserved PEG channels during the term by providing the franchisee
with written notice 180 days prior to the date it intends to activate any or all of the reserved
PEG channels. Such written notice shall specify the programming to be carried on such PEG
channel(s), and shall include an operation plan providing sufficient information about the
administration, programming, and operation of the requested PEG channel(s).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such operation plan shall provide for the cablecast of any
such PEG channel(s) for a period of not less than eight continuous hours of original
programming per calendar week for not less than four such consecutive weeks. Such notice
shall also authorize the franchisee to transmit the PEG channel(s) within and outside the LFA.
Thereafter, the franchisee shall assign the PEG channel(s) on its channel lineup as set forth
in such notice, to the extent such channel assignment does not interfere with any preexisting
channels. The CCCG member jurisdiction or its designee activating the PEG channel(s) shall
have complete control over the content, scheduling, and administration of the PEG channel(s)
and may delegate such functions, or a portion or such functions, to an appropriate designee.
The franchisee shall neither have nor attempt to exercise any editorial control over PEG
channel programming.
If the LFA or its designee is the CCCG member jurisdiction requesting activation of the PEG
channel(s), following receipt of such activation request, the franchisee shall use reasonable
efforts to interconnect its cable system with existing cable operator(s) in the relevant franchise
area, which may include areas within the geographic limits of those municipalities that
comprise the CCCG. After receiving such notice of activation, the franchisee shall initiate
interconnection negotiations with the existing cable operator(s) to cablecast, on a live basis,
public, educational or governmental programming consistent with this franchise.
Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave link, satellite or other
technically feasible and reasonable method of connection. The franchisee shall negotiate in
good faith with existing cable operator(s) respecting reasonable, mutually convenient, costeffective,
and technically viable interconnection points, methods, terms and conditions. If the
LFA or its designee is the requesting CCCG member jurisdiction, and the interconnection
point is within the LFA's jurisdictional boundaries, the LFA shall use its best efforts to require
the existing cable operator(s) to provide such interconnection to the franchisee on reasonable
terms and conditions. The construction costs and ongoing expenses of interconnection shall
be fairly shared between the franchisee and the existing cable operator(s). The franchisee
and the existing cable operator(s) shall negotiate the precise terms and conditions of an
interconnection agreement, and the LFA or its designee shall use its best efforts to facilitate
these negotiations. If the franchisee is unable to reach such an agreement within 30 days
after requesting in writing to interconnect with other local cable operator(s), the LFA or its
designee shall use its best efforts to assist in mediating such dispute. If no agreement is
reached within an additional 30 days, the franchisee agrees that the LFA or its designee shall
designate the point of interconnection. If the cost of interconnection would be unreasonable,
interconnection is not technically feasible or would cause an unacceptable increase in
subscriber rates, or if an existing cable operator will not agree to reasonable terms and
conditions of interconnection, the franchisee will be under no obligation to interconnect with
the existing cable operator.
If the procedures of Subsection A(3) do not result in interconnection of the franchisee's cable
system with the existing cable operator(s)' for purposes of providing PEG channel(s), the LFA
or its designee may require the franchisee to provide a video link to the Chester County
Intergovernmental Unit (CCIU) Educational Service Center, 455 Boot Road, Downingtown, PA
19335, where PEG access programming is originated for the purpose of cablecasting PEG
programming. The franchisee shall not be obligated to provide the LFA or its designee with
either cablecast equipment and facilities or personnel responsible for maintaining and
operating such equipment and facilities or generating any such PEG programming.

PEG grant.
The franchisee shall provide an annual grant to the CCCG member jurisdiction(s) or their
designee(s) requesting PEG channel(s) to be used in support of the production of local PEG
programming (the "annual PEG grant"). Such grant shall be used by the requesting CCCG
member jurisdiction or its designee for PEG access equipment, including, but not limited to,
studio and portable production equipment, editing equipment and program playback
equipment, or for renovation or construction of PEG access facilities.
The annual PEG grant provided by the franchisee hereunder shall not exceed $0.25, per
month, per subscriber in the service area to the franchisee's basic service tier; provided,
however, that if any cable operator(s) other than the franchisee providing cable service within
the geographical boundaries of the LFA also provides PEG programming within the
geographical boundaries of the LFA, the franchisee shall not be obligated to pay the annual
PEG grant until the LFA or its designee begins to exercise whatever rights (if any) the LFA
may have pursuant to the LFA's existing franchise agreement(s) with such cable operator(s)
to receive comparable financial or tangible support for PEG programming from such cable
operator(s). The annual PEG grant payment, along with a brief summary of the subscriber
information upon which it is based, shall be delivered to applicable CCCG member
jurisdictions or their designees within 60 days after the beginning of each calendar year
during the franchise term. Calculation of the annual PEG grant will commence with the first
calendar month during which the franchisee receives written request to activate any of the
reserved PEG channels. The annual PEG grant will become effective upon written request by
the LFA or designee following activation of any of the PEG channels held in reserve outlined
in Subsection A. The annual PEG grant shall be payable based on the number of PEG
channels activated pursuant to Subsection A, e.g., if one PEG channel is activated, the
annual PEG grant shall be up to the sum of $0.15, per month, per subscriber in the relevant
service area. If two PEG channels are activated, the annual PEG grant shall be up to the sum
of $0.20, per month, per subscriber in the relevant service area. If three PEG channels are
activated, the annual PEG grant shall be up to the sum of $0.25, per month, per subscriber in
the relevant service area.
Indemnity for PEG. The LFA or its designee shall require all local producers and users of any of
the PEG facilities or channels to agree in writing to authorize the franchisee to transmit
programming consistent with this agreement and to defend and hold harmless the franchisee and
the LFA or its designee from and against any and all liability or other injury, including the
reasonable cost of defending claims or litigation arising from or in connection with claims for failure
to comply with applicable federal laws, rules, regulations or other requirements of local, state or
federal authorities; for claims of libel, slander, invasion of privacy, or the infringement of common
law or statutory copyright; for unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name or service mark; for
breach of contractual or other obligations owing to third parties by the producer or user; and for
any other injury or damage in law or equity which results from the use of a PEG facility or channel.
The LFA or its designee shall establish rules and regulations for use of PEG facilities consistent
with, and as required by, 47 U.S.C. § 531, which currently states: "(a) A franchising authority may
establish requirements in a franchise with respect to the designation or use of channel capacity for
public, educational, or governmental use only to the extent provided in this section; (b) A
franchising authority may in its request for proposals require as part of a franchise, and may
require as part of a cable operator's proposal for a franchise renewal, subject to Section 546 of
this title, that channel capacity be designated for public, educational, or governmental use, and
channel capacity on institutional networks be designated for educational or governmental use, and
may require rules and procedures for the use of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this
section; (c) A franchising authority may enforce any requirement in any franchise regarding the
providing or use of such channel capacity. Such enforcement authority includes the authority to
enforce any provisions of the franchise for services, facilities, or equipment proposed by the cable
operator which relate to public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity, whether or
not required by the franchising authority pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; (d) In the case
of any franchise under which channel capacity is designated under subsection (b) of this section,
the franchising authority shall prescribe (1) rules and procedures under which the cable operator is

permitted to use such channel capacity for the provision of other services if such channel capacity
is not being used for the purposes designated; and (2) rules and procedures under which such
permitted use shall cease; (e) Subject to Section 544(d) of this title, a cable operator shall not
exercise any editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel
capacity provided pursuant to this section, except a cable operator may refuse to transmit any
public access program or portion of a public access program which contains obscenity, indecency,
or nudity; (f) For purposes of this section, the term 'institutional network' means a communication
network which is constructed or operated by the cable operator and which is generally available
only to subscribers who are not residential subscribers." The term "franchising authority" as used
in 47 U.S.C. § 531 shall be interpreted with respect to PEG to mean any CCCG member
jurisdiction or its designee that activates a PEG channel.
Recovery of costs. To the extent permitted by federal law, the franchisee shall be allowed to
recover the costs of an annual PEG grant or any other costs arising from the provision of PEG
services from subscribers and to include such costs as a separately billed line item on each
subscriber's bill. Without limiting the foregoing, if allowed under state and federal laws, the
franchisee may externalize, line-item, or otherwise pass through interconnection costs to
subscribers.
§ A270-6. Franchise fees.
Payment to the LFA. The franchisee shall pay to the LFA a franchise fee of 5% of annual gross
revenue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all cable operators providing cable service in the
franchise area pay the LFA a higher franchise fee pursuant to their franchises, the franchisee
agrees to pay the same increased franchise fee to the extent permitted by law. In accordance with
Title VI of the Communications Act, the twelve-month period applicable under the franchise for the
computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year. Such payments shall be made no later
than 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter. The franchisee shall be allowed to submit
or correct any payments that were incorrectly omitted, and shall be refunded any payments that
were incorrectly submitted in connection with the quarterly franchise fee remittances within 90
days following the close of the calendar year for which such payments were applicable.
Supporting information. Each franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a brief report
showing the basis for the computation of the franchise fee payment that shall be prepared by a
qualified representative authorized by the franchisee to prepare and certify the report. The report
shall be certified by such representative to be true and correct.
Limitation on franchise fee actions. The parties agree that the period of limitation for commencing
any action for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three years from the end
of the calendar year in which payment by the franchisee is due.
Bundled services. If cable services subject to the franchise fee required under this Article 7 are
provided to subscribers in conjunction with non-cable services, the franchise fee shall be applied
only to the value of the cable services, as reflected on the books and records of the franchisee in
accordance with FCC or state public utility regulatory commission rules, regulations, standards or
orders.
Audits.
The LFA may audit the franchisee's books and records during the term, but no more than
once every three years. During any audit period, the LFA may commence an audit of the
franchisee's books and records for the portion of the calendar year preceding the audit in
addition to the three prior calendar years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the LFA may
commence an audit within 30 days of its final franchise fee payment in order to audit books
and records pertaining to the time period not encompassed by any previous audit period with
respect to the final three years of the term. All records reasonably necessary for any such
audit shall be made available by the franchisee to the LFA.

Each party shall bear its own costs of an audit; provided, however, that if the results of any
audit indicate that the franchisee underpaid any franchise fee payment by 5% or more, then
the franchisee shall pay the reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs of the audit;
provided, however, that the franchisee shall not be required to reimburse the LFA for costs
exceeding $5,000 for each audit.
If the results of an audit indicate an overpayment or underpayment of franchise fees, the
parties agree that such overpayment or under payment shall be returned to the proper party
within 45 days; provided, however, that the franchisee shall be required to remit
underpayments to the LFA together with interest at prime rate (as published in The Wall
Street Journal) plus 0.5% of the amount correctly due from the date such underpayment
would have been due.
Any auditor employed by the LFA shall be a certified public accountant and shall not be
permitted to be compensated on a success-based formula, e.g., payment based on an
underpayment of fees, if any.
§ A270-7. Customer service.
Customer service requirements are set forth in Exhibit C, which shall be binding unless amended by
written consent of the parties.[1]
Editor's Note: Exhibit C is on file in the Township office.
§ A270-8. Reports and records.
Open books and records. Upon reasonable written notice to the franchisee and with no less than
30 days' written notice to the franchisee, the LFA shall have the right to inspect the franchisee's
books and records pertaining to the franchisee's provision of cable service in the franchise area at
any time during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis as are reasonably necessary
to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the
section or subsection of the franchise which is under review, so that the franchisee may organize
the necessary books and records for appropriate access by the LFA. The franchisee shall not be
required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three
years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the franchisee shall not be
required to disclose information that it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in
nature, nor disclose any of its or an affiliate's books and records not relating to the provision of
cable service in the service area. The LFA shall treat any information disclosed by the franchisee
as confidential and shall only disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that
have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The franchisee shall not be
required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Communications Act,
47 U.S.C. § 551.
Records required. the franchisee shall at all times maintain:
Records of all written complaints for a period of the calendar year after receipt by the
franchisee as well as three years thereafter. The term "complaint" as used herein refers to
complaints about any aspect of the cable system or the franchisee's cable operations,
including, without limitation, complaints about employee courtesy. Complaints recorded will
not be limited to complaints requiring an employee service call;
Records of outages for a period of the calendar year after occurrence as well as three years
thereafter, indicating date, duration, area, and the number of subscribers affected, type of
outage, and cause;

Indemnification:
Except as directly related to or arising directly out of the negligence or willful misconduct of
the LFA, its officials, officers, agents, employees, independent contractors, or third parties, the
franchisee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the LFA, and its officials,
officers, agents, boards, employees, and independent contractors from and against any
liability for damages, claims, judgments, suits, and awards resulting from tangible property
damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) or financial loss, to the extent proximately
caused by the franchisee's negligent construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable
system, provided that the LFA shall give the franchisee written notice of the LFA's request for
indemnification within 30 days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this subsection and
10 days following service of legal process on the LFA or its designated agent of any action
related to this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee shall not indemnify
the LFA for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence
of the LFA, its officers, agents, employees, attorneys, consultants, independent contractors or
third parties or for any activity or function conducted by any person other than the franchisee
in connection with PEG access, or EAS, or the distribution of any cable service over the cable
system.
With respect to the franchisee's indemnity obligations set forth in Subsection B(1), the
franchisee shall provide the defense of any claims brought against the LFA by selecting
counsel of the franchisee's choice to defend the claim, subject to the consent of the LFA,
which shall not unreasonably be withheld. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the LFA
from cooperating with the franchisee and participating in the defense of any litigation by its
own counsel at its own cost and expense. The franchisee shall neither settle nor compromise
any claim or action without the prior written consent of the LFA, which such consent may be
withheld by the LFA in the reasonable exercise of its governmental discretion. In the event
that the terms of any such settlement do not include the release of the LFA and the LFA does
not consent to the terms of any such settlement or compromise, the franchisee shall not settle
the claim or action but its obligation to indemnify the LFA shall in no event exceed the
maximum possible amount that would have been payable had the LFA consented to the
terms of such settlement.
The LFA shall hold harmless and defend the franchisee from and against and shall be
responsible for damages, liability, or claims resulting from or arising out of the willful
misconduct or negligence of the LFA. The LFA shall provide the defense of any claims
brought against the franchisee by selecting counsel of the LFA's choice to defend the claim,
subject to the consent of the franchisee, which shall not unreasonably be withheld.
The LFA shall be responsible for its own acts of willful misconduct or negligence, or breach of
obligation, subject to any and all defenses and limitations of liability provided by law.
§ A270-10. Transfer of franchise.
Transfer. Subject to Section 617 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 537, no transfer of the
franchise shall occur without the prior consent of the LFA, provided that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. No such consent shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, by assignment of any rights, title, or interest
of the franchisee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness, or for
transactions otherwise excluded under § A270-1's definition of "transfer of the franchise."
§ A270-11. Renewal of franchise.
Governing law. The LFA and the franchisee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the LFA
that relate to the renewal of this franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of

Section 626 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546.
Needs assessments. In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626 of the
Communications Act, the LFA shall notify the franchisee of all of its assessments regarding the
identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of
the franchisee under the then current franchise term. Such assessments shall be provided to the
franchisee by the LFA promptly so that the franchisee has adequate time to submit a proposal
under Section 626 and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term.
Informal negotiations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the franchisee and
the LFA agree that at any time during the term of the then current franchise, while affording the
public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, the LFA and the franchisee may agree to
undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise, and
the LFA may grant a renewal thereof.
Consistent terms. The franchisee and the LFA consider the terms set forth in this Article 12 to be
consistent with the express provisions of Section 626.
§ A270-12. Enforcement and termination of franchise.
Notice of violation. If at any time the LFA believes that the franchisee has not complied with the
terms of the franchise, the LFA shall informally discuss the matter with the franchisee. If these
discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem in a reasonable time, the LFA shall then notify
the franchisee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance in a reasonable time (for
purposes of this article, the "noncompliance notice").
The franchisee's right to cure or respond. The franchisee shall have 15 days in the case of the
failure of the franchisee to pay any sum or other amount due the LFA under this agreement, and
30 days in all other cases, from receipt of the noncompliance notice to: (i) respond to the LFA, if
the franchisee contests (in whole or in part) the assertion of noncompliance; (ii) cure such
noncompliance; or (iii) in the event that, by its nature, such noncompliance cannot be cured within
such thirty-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such noncompliance and notify the LFA
of the steps being taken and the date by which they are projected to be completed. Upon cure of
any noncompliance, the LFA shall provide written confirmation that such cure has been effected.
Written notice from the LFA. In the event that the franchisee fails to respond to the noncompliance
notice pursuant to the procedures required by this article, or in the event that the alleged
noncompliance is not remedied within the applicable cure period pursuant to Subsection B above
or the date projected pursuant to Subsection B(iii) above, if the LFA seeks to continue its
investigation into the alleged noncompliance, then the LFA shall provide the franchisee with
written notice thereof. Such written notice shall set forth the reasons why the LFA believes that the
franchisee has not cured the default and shall set forth the LFA's proposed action, which may
include the following:
Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as
an alternative to damages;
Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or
In the case of a substantial noncompliance with a material provision of this franchise, seek to
revoke the franchise in accordance with Subsection D.
Public meeting; revocation. Should the LFA seek to revoke this franchise after following the
procedures set forth in Subsection C, the franchisee shall have 60 days from receipt of such
notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the LFA has not
received a satisfactory response from the franchisee, it may then seek termination of the franchise
at a regularly scheduled and properly noticed public meeting pursuant to the schedule announced

at the LFA's annual organizational meeting as required by 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 709(a); provided,
however, that the LFA shall cause to be served upon the franchisee, at least 30 business days
prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and
stating its intent to revoke the franchise; provided also, however, that the LFA shall provide public
notice of the meeting as defined in 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 703, which shall include the fact that
termination of the franchise will be an agenda item at the public meeting, at least 14 days prior to
such public meeting.
At the designated public meeting, the franchisee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full
participation, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant
evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the
officials, agents, employees or consultants of the LFA, to compel the testimony of other
persons as permitted by law, and to question and/or cross-examine witnesses. A complete
verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such meeting at the franchisee's sole cost
and expense.
Following the public meeting described above in this Subsection D, the franchisee shall be
provided up to 30 days to submit its proposed findings and conclusions to the LFA in writing
and thereafter the LFA shall determine: (i) whether an event of default has occurred under this
franchise; (ii) whether such event of default is excusable; and (iii) whether such event of
default has been cured or will be cured by the franchisee. The LFA shall also determine
whether it will revoke the franchise based on the information presented or, where applicable,
grant additional time to the franchisee to effect any cure. If the LFA determines that it will
revoke the franchise, the LFA shall promptly provide the franchisee with a written
determination setting forth the LFA's reasoning for such revocation. the franchisee may
appeal such written determination of the LFA to an appropriate court, which shall have the
power to review the decision of the LFA de novo. The franchisee shall be entitled to such
relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be taken within the shorter of 45 days
or the period otherwise permitted by law of the franchisee's receipt of the written
determination of the LFA.
The LFA may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action that it deems appropriate to enforce
the LFA's rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
The franchisee termination. The franchisee shall have the right to terminate this franchise and all
obligations hereunder within 90 days after the end of three years from the service date of this
franchise if at the end of such three-year period the franchisee does not then in good faith believe
it has achieved a commercially reasonable level of subscriber penetration on its cable system. The
franchisee may consider subscriber penetration levels outside the franchise area in this
determination. Notice to terminate under this Subsection E shall be given to the LFA in writing,
with such termination to take effect no sooner than 180 days after giving such notice. The
franchisee shall also be required to give its then current subscribers not less than 120 days' prior
written notice of its intent to cease cable service operations.
§ A270-13. Miscellaneous provisions.
Actions of parties. In any action by the LFA or the franchisee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner.
Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such
approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Binding acceptance. This agreement shall bind and benefit the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, beneficiaries, administrators, executors, receivers, trustees, successors and assigns, and
the promises and obligations herein shall survive the expiration date hereof.
Preemption. In the event that federal or state law, rules, or regulations preempt a provision or limit
the enforceability of a provision of this agreement, the provision shall be read to be preempted to

the extent, and for the time, but only to the extent and for the time, required by law. In the event
such federal or state law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or
otherwise changed so that the provision hereof that had been preempted is no longer preempted,
such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on the
parties hereto, without the requirement of further action on the part of the LFA.
Force majeure. The franchisee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the
provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or
default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by a force
majeure.
Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the LFA's intention to subject the
franchisee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of the
franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative
impact on subscribers, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and
hardship being placed upon the franchisee that outweigh the benefit to be derived by the LFA
and/or subscribers.
Notices. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, notices required under the franchise shall be
mailed first class, postage prepaid, to the addressees below. Each party may change its designee

Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, paragraph, term, or provision hereof is
determined to be illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional, by any court of competent jurisdiction or by

no effect on the validity of any other section, subsection, sentence, paragraph, term or provision
hereof, all of which will remain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise.

Network, including, without limitation, the cable system and any capacity used for cable service or
otherwise, to the LFA or any third party. The franchisee shall not be required to remove the FTTP
Network or to relocate the FTTP Network or any portion thereof as a result of revocation,
expiration, termination, denial of renewal or any other action to forbid or disallow the franchisee
from providing cable services, provided that and for so long as the franchisee retains its right
under applicable law to use the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services. This
provision is not intended to contravene leased access requirements under Title VI or PEG
requirements set out in this agreement.
Independent review. The LFA and the franchisee each acknowledge that they have received
independent legal advice in entering into this agreement. In the event that a dispute arises over
