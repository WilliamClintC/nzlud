ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 105-101. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Chadds Ford Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 105-102. Statement of findings.
The governing body of Chadds Ford Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces infiltration, and
threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns,
accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of stream
beds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying
aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and
loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens.
Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment, and activities
causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of
the people of this municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
infiltration for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high
water quality, infiltration, stream base flow, and aquatic ecosystems.
The most cost-effective and environmentally advantageous way to
manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project design that
minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoids sensitive areas (i.e.,
stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and considers topography
and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
§ 105-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 105-102
1:139
§ 105-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within Chadds Ford Township by maintaining the natural hydrologic
regime and minimizing the impacts described in § 105-102 of this chapter
through provisions designed to:
G. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
A. Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the
impacts on surface water and groundwater.
B. Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
C. Minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume.
D. Minimize impervious surfaces.
E. Manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause these problems.
F. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
G. Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
I. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain base flow, to prevent
degradation of surface water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise
protect water resources.
J. Protect base flows and quality of streams and watercourses, where
possible.
K. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at Title 25, Pennsylvania Code, Chapter 93.4(a) requiring
protection and maintenance of "existing uses" and maintenance of the
level of water quality to support those uses in all streams, and the
protection and maintenance of water quality in "special protection"
streams.

§ 105-104. Statutory authority.
Chadds Ford Township is empowered or required to regulate land use
activities that affect runoff and surface water and groundwater quality and
quantity by the authority of:
§ 105-105. Applicability; regulated activities.
L. Address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from the
development site.
M. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES MS4 permit requirements.
N. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses nonstormwater discharges into the municipality's separate
storm sewer system (MS4).
O. Preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
P. Prevent accelerated scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream
channels.
Q. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on
watershed-wide stormwater management planning.
R. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities and BMPs that are implemented
within the municipality.
A. The Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as
amended, the Storm Water Management Act (hereinafter referred to as
"the Act").
B. The Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. § 66501 et seq., and § 66601
et seq.
C. The Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.38
A. All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including but not limited to land development, redevelopment,
and earth disturbance activity located within Chadds Ford Township,
are subject to regulation by this chapter.
B. This chapter contains the stormwater management performance
standards and design criteria that are necessary from a watershed-wide
perspective. Local stormwater management design criteria (e.g., inlet
spacing, inlet type, collection system design and details, outlet
structure design, etc.) shall continue to be regulated by the applicable
municipal ordinances and applicable state regulations.

§ 105-106. Exemptions.
A. An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from implementing the
requirements of this chapter or from implementing such measures as
are necessary to protect public health, safety, and property. An
exemption shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the
special requirements for watersheds draining to identified high-quality
(HQ) or exceptional-value (EV) waters or any other current or future
state or municipal water quality protection requirements. If a drainage
problem is documented or known to exist downstream of, or is expected
from, the proposed activity, then Chadds Ford Township may withdraw
exemptions listed in Table 106.1 and require the applicant to comply
with all requirements of this chapter. Even though the applicant is
exempt, he is not relieved from complying with other municipal
ordinances or regulations.
B. General exemptions.
(1) Table 106.1 summarizes the exemptions from certain provisions of
this chapter. Exemptions are for the items noted in Table 106.1 only
and shall not relieve the applicant from other applicable sections of
this chapter.
(2) Any regulated activity that is exempt from some provisions of this
chapter is exempt only from those provisions. If development is to
take place in phases, the developer is responsible for implementing
the requirements of this chapter as the impervious cover/earth
disturbance threshold is met. The date of adoption of this chapter
shall be the starting point from which to consider tracts as "parent
tracts" in which future subdivisions and respective impervious area
and earth disturbance computations shall be cumulatively
considered. Exemption shall not relieve the applicant from
implementing such measures as are necessary to protect health,
safety, and property.
For example:
If a property owner proposes a one-hundred-fifty-square-foot shed
after adoption of this chapter, that property owner would be
exempted from water quality and quantity requirements of this
chapter as noted in Table 106.1 of this chapter. If, at a later date,
the property owner proposes to construct a four-hundred-ninetynine-
square-foot room in addition, the applicant would be required
to comply with the requirements for the Simplified Method for the
full 649 square feet of impervious cover created since adoption of
this chapter. If an additional seven-hundred-square-foot swimming
pool/patio is proposed later, the property owner would be required
to implement the full stormwater quantity and quality control
submission requirements of this chapter for the total 1,349 square
feet of additional impervious surface added to the original
property since adoption of this chapter.

A. Applicants proposing regulated activities in the municipality which do
not fall under the exemption criteria shown in § 105-106 shall submit a
stormwater management site plan consistent with this chapter and the
applicable watershed stormwater management plan to the municipality
for review. The stormwater management criteria of this chapter shall
apply to the total proposed development even if development is to take
place in stages.
B. No regulated activity within the municipality shall commence until the
municipality issues approval of an SWM plan, which demonstrates
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(1) For any site with proposed regulated earth disturbance equal to or
greater than one acre where, after a close evaluation of alternative
site designs, it proves to be impracticable to meet the mandatory
minimum volume and infiltration control standards of this chapter
on site, the municipality may approve measures other than those in
this chapter after consultation with and evaluation by PADEP that
the alternate site design meets state water quality requirements
and does not conflict with state law, including, but not limited to,
the Clean Streams Law.
(2) For any site with proposed regulated earth disturbance that is less
than one acre where, after a close evaluation of alternative site
designs, it proves to be impracticable to meet any one or more of
the mandatory minimum standards of this chapter on site, the
municipality may approve measures other than those in this
chapter.
(3) "Regulated earth disturbance" is defined to mean any activity
involving earth disturbance subject to regulation under 25 Pa.
Code, Chapter 92; 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102; or the Clean Streams
Law.

accomplished, then the applicant is required to attempt to infiltrate
the volume required in § 105-305C(2)(b).
(3) Finally, if the § 105-305C(2)(b) infiltration volume cannot be
physically accomplished, the applicant must, at a minimum,
infiltrate the maximum volume the site can accommodate.
C. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed or
redeveloped areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and
site conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP
and the top of the limiting zone.
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater volume and dewater completely as determined by
field tests conducted by the applicant's design professional.
(c) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely draining
the retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) within three days (72
hours) from the end of the design storm.
(2) The size of the infiltration facility and Rev shall be based upon the
following volume criteria:
(a) Modified Control Guideline One (MCG-1) of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices (PA BMP) Manual 
The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) to be captured and
infiltrated shall be the net two-year, twenty-four-hour volume.
The net volume is the difference between the postdevelopment
runoff volume and the predevelopment runoff
volume. The post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation shall not be increased. For modeling
purposes, existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious
areas must be considered meadow in good condition or its
equivalent, and 20% of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Infiltrating the entire Rev volume in § 105-305C(2)(a) (above)
may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific limitations
such as shallow depth to bedrock or the water table. If it
cannot be physically accomplished, then the following criteria
from Modified Control Guideline Two (MCG-2) of the PA BMP
Manual must be satisfied:
[1] At least the first one inch of runoff from new or
replacement impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated.
§ 105-305 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 105-305
1:173
Rev = 1 (inch) * impervious area (square feet) ÷ 12
(inches) = cubic feet (cf)
An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
[2] The retention volume value derived from the methods in
§ 105-305C(2)(a) or (b) is the minimum volume the
applicant must control through an infiltration BMP facility.
If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions
of the impervious area, the infiltration volume for the
remaining area should be increased an equivalent amount
to offset the loss.
[3] Only when the minimum infiltration requirement cannot
be physically accomplished, a waiver from § 105-305,
Infiltration volume requirements, is required from the
municipality.
D. Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified design professional and at minimum address
soil permeability, depth to at least two feet below the stormwater
management facility, and subgrade stability. The general process for
designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface)
to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev)
volume based on field-determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface.
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the municipality
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
E. Infiltration facilities should, to the greatest extent practicable, be
located to avoid introducing contaminants via groundwater and be in
conformance with an approved source water protection assessment or
source water protection plan.
F. Roadway drainage systems should provide an opportunity to capture
accidental spills. Road de-icing material storage facilities shall be
§ 105-305 CHADDS FORD CODE § 105-305
1:174
§ 105-306. Water quality requirements.
The applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements of
this article:
designed to avoid salt and chloride runoff from entering waterways and
infiltration facilities. The qualified design professional shall evaluate
the possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration facility and perform a hydrogeologic justification study if
necessary.
G. The antidegredation analysis found in Chapter 93 shall be applied in
HQ or EV streams.
H. An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. The municipality may
require a detailed hydrogeologic investigation.
I. The applicant should provide safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination
should there be a mishap or spill.
A. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated
activities and conform to state water quality requirements, BMPs which
replicate predevelopment stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions
must be provided in the site design such that post-construction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or
biological characteristics of the receiving waters. This may be achieved
by the following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to provide filtering
of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff;
and
(3) Stream bank and stream bed protection: management of volume
and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
B. Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment facilities
necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration
volume computed under § 105-305 may be a component of the water
quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both components in a
single facility. If the calculated water quality volume (WQv) is greater
than the volume required to be infiltrated as described in
§ 105-305C(2), then the difference between the two volumes shall be
treated for water quality by an acceptable stormwater management
practice(s). The required water quality volume (WQv) is the storage
capacity needed to capture and treat a portion of stormwater runoff
from the developed areas of the site.
§ 105-305 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 105-306
1:175
(1) To achieve this requirement, the following criterion is established:
(a) From Control Guideline 1 (CG-1) in the PA BMP Manual, the
water quality volume shall be the net two-year, twenty-fourhour
volume. The net volume is the difference between the
post-development runoff volume and the predevelopment
runoff volume. The post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation shall not be increased. For modeling
purposes, existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious
areas must be considered meadow in good condition or its
equivalent, and 20% of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow in good condition.
(2) This volume requirement can be managed by the permanent
volume of a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs.
Where appropriate, wet basins shall be utilized for water quality
control and shall follow the guidelines of the PA BMP Manual
referenced in Appendix B.44
(3) Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert
of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The
design of the facility shall provide for protection from clogging and
unwanted sedimentation.
C. The temperature of receiving waters shall be protected through the use
of BMPs that moderate temperature.
D. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through, or a water body
(i.e., lake, pond, and wetland) is present on the site, the applicant shall
create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet to either side of
the top-of-bank of the channel, lake, or wetland. The buffer area shall be
planted with native vegetation and maintained in a vegetated state
(Refer to Appendix B, Pennsylvania Native Plant List, contained in the
PA BMP Manual).
(1) The following provisions also apply to riparian buffers on lots in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter:
(a) If the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50 feet,
the buffer width may be reduced to 25% of the setback or 25
feet, whichever is greater.
(b) If a stream traverses a site in a manner that significantly
reduces the use of the site, the buffer may be either:
[1] Reduced to 25 feet on either side, with municipal approval;
or
[2] Reduced to 10 feet with municipal waiver; or

§ 105-307. Stream bank erosion requirements.
[3] If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (e.g., deed
covenant, easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirement
of this chapter, the existing buffer shall be maintained.
(2) Permitted uses within the buffer include the following, subject to
municipal approval and provided that they comply with all federal,
state, and local regulations:
(a) Recreational trails. See Appendix H, Riparian Buffer Trail
Guidelines.45
(b) Utility rights-of-way.
(c) Bridges.
(d) Other uses subject to municipal approval.
E. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant,
easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the
existing buffer shall be maintained.
A. In addition to controlling the water quality volume (in order to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion),
the primary requirement to control stream bank erosion is to design a
BMP to detain the proposed conditions' two-year, twenty-four-hour
design storm to the existing conditions' one-year flow using the SCS
Type II distribution. Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as
adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure) to release
the proposed conditions' one-year storm for a minimum of 24 hours
from a point in time when the maximum volume of water from the oneyear
storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., the maximum water
surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin
at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at
the invert of the facility).
B. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter where possible, and a trash rack shall be
installed to prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas
contributing to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume to
allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the
calculations shall be submitted showing this condition. When the
calculated orifice size is below three inches, gravel filters (or other
methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to the
Municipal Engineer's satisfaction. When filters are utilized,
maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the
design function. All facilities shall make use of measures to extend the
flow path and increase the travel time of flows in the facility.

§ 105-308. Stormwater peak rate control.
A. Each watershed has been divided into either stormwater management
districts or release rate districts as shown on the respective
Management District or Release Rate Maps in Appendix A.46
(1) In addition to the watershed-specific requirements specified in
Tables 308.1 and 308.2 below, the erosion and sedimentation
control (§ 105-303), the nonstructural project design (§ 105-304),
the infiltration (§ 105-305), the water quality (§ 105-306), and the
stream bank erosion (§ 105-307) requirements shall be
implemented.
(2) Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in a watershed
for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year
design storms are shown in Tables 308.1 and 308.2. Development
sites located in each of the management/release rate districts must
control proposed conditions' runoff rates to existing conditions'
runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with the table.
B. General. Proposed conditions' rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the Stormwater
Management District Watershed Map (Appendix A) and this section of
this chapter.
C. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official map that is available for inspection at
the municipal and county planning offices. A copy of the official map at
a reduced scale is included in Appendix A. The exact location of the
stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given
development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using
the two-foot topographic contours (or most-accurate data required)
provided as part of the SWM site plan.
D. Sites located in more than one district or watershed. For a proposed
development site located within two or more stormwater management
district subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet
the management district criteria for which the discharge is located. The
natural hydrology of each respective subarea shall be maintained, and
drainage shall not be redirected from one subarea to another. Under
circumstances where the applicant shows this cannot be accomplished,
a waiver is required by the municipality.

E. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.
F. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the peak rate control standards noted above.

capacity analysis conducted at the direction of Chadds Ford Township
shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting
peak flow rates:
§ 105-308 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 105-308
1:179
§ 105-309. Calculation methodology.
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year storm event within
their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels
from erosion. Velocities shall be based upon criteria and
methodologies acceptable to the municipality.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year storm event runoff without creating any
increased hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other hydraulic facilities
which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be
designed in accordance with PADEP Chapter 105 regulations (if
applicable) and, at a minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year
storm event runoff.
(4) Water quality requirements defined in § 105-306 must be met.

greater than five acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex
Method. Table 309.1 summarizes acceptable computation methods. The
method selected by the design professional shall be based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. The use of the Rational Method to estimate peak discharges for
drainage areas greater than five acres shall be permitted only upon
approval of the municipality.

Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return-period storms. Rainfall depths shall be according to
NOAA Atlas 14 values consistent with a partial duration series. When
stormwater calculations are performed for routing procedures or water

C. The following criteria shall be used for peak rate runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used in determining the existing conditions' flow rates shall
be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." Portions of a site having more than one viable tree
measuring a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or
greater per 1,500 square feet shall be considered wooded
where such trees existed within three years of application.
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site, including agriculture,
bare earth, and fallow ground, shall be considered as "meadow
in good condition," unless the natural ground cover generates
a lower curve (CN) number or Rational "c" value (i.e., woods)
as listed in Table F-1 or F-2 in Appendix F of this chapter.47
(2) For redevelopment sites, the ground cover used in determining the
existing conditions' flow rates for the developed portion of the site
shall be based on the following ground cover assumptions which
shall be used:
(a) For areas that are woods (as defined in Article II of this
chapter), predevelopment calculations shall assume ground
cover of "woods in good condition."
47.Editor's Note: Appendix F is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 105-309 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 105-309
1:181
(b) For areas that are not woods or not impervious surfaces,
predevelopment calculations shall assume ground cover of
"meadow."
(c) For areas that are impervious surfaces, predevelopment
calculations shall assume at least 20% of the existing
impervious surface area to be disturbed as "meadow" ground
cover.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration (duration) and
storm events with rainfall intensities obtained from NOAA Atlas 14
partial duration series estimates, or the latest version of the PennDOT
Drainage Manual (PDM Publication 584). Times-of-concentration shall
be calculated based on the methodology recommended in the
respective model used. Times of concentration for channel and pipe
flow shall be computed using Manning's Equation.
E. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from
Table F-1 in Appendix F of this chapter.
F. Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use
in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table F-2 in Appendix F
of this chapter.
G. Hydraulic computations to determine the capacity of pipes, culverts,
and storm sewers shall be consistent with methods and computations
contained in the Federal Highway Administration Hydraulic Design
Series Number 5 (Publication No. FHWA-NHI-01-020 HDS No. 5).
Hydraulic computations to determine the capacity of open channels
shall be consistent with methods and computations contained in the
Federal Highway Administration Hydraulic Engineering Circular
Number 15 (Publication No. FHWA-NHI-05-114 HEC 15). Values for
Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table F-3

H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using an acceptable
method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a
calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The municipality
may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph
approximation technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is
consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full
hydrograph.

construction to prevent the flow of sediment through the basin
outlet pipe. Such measures may include temporary riser pipes,
rock-filled gabions, plywood stand-boxes, silt fences, and the like.
(3) Emergency spillways. Whenever possible, the emergency spillway
for basins shall be constructed on undisturbed ground. Emergency
spillways shall be constructed of reinforced concrete, vegetated
earth, concrete rubble, and the like. All emergency spillways shall
be constructed so that the basin berm is protected against erosion.
The minimum capacity of all emergency spillways shall be such that
the combined capacity of the emergency spillway and the principal
from the one-hundred-year design storm after development.
Emergency spillways shall extend along the upstream and
downstream berm embankment slopes. The emergency spillway
shall not discharge stormwater over earthen fill and/or easily
erodible material without adequate protection against erosion.
(4) Antiseep collars. Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the basin
berms. The antiseep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel
shall be watertight. The antiseep collars shall extend to a minimum
of two feet beyond the outside of the principal pipe barrel. The
maximum spacing between collars shall be 14 times the minimum
projection of the collar measured perpendicular to the pipe.
(5) Basin outlets. Energy-dissipating devices (rip-rap, stilling basin,
concrete aprons, and the like) shall be placed at all basin outlets.
Rock-level spreader berms shall be required where basins do not
discharge into an existing drainage swale, ditch or channel.
Concrete endwalls shall be placed at all basin outlets. All basin
outlet pipes 12 inches in diameter or greater shall be equipped with
childproof devices.

earthen basin embankments shall be 3:1. The top or toe of any
slope shall be located a minimum of 15 feet from adjacent property
lines, with the exception of the downstream property line, where
the toe of the embankment shall be placed a sufficient distance to
allow for energy-dissipating devices but in no case less than 30 feet
unless approved otherwise by the Township. Whenever possible,
the side slopes and basin shape shall blend with the natural
§ 105-311 CHADDS FORD CODE § 105-311
1:184
topography. Straight side slopes and rectangular basins shall be
avoided whenever possible.

detention basins, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for
all sheet flow. A minimum grade of 1.0% shall be maintained for all
channel flow.
(10) Cut-off trench. A cut-off trench shall be excavated along the center
line of the dam on earth fill embankments. The minimum depth
shall be three feet. The minimum bottom width shall be 10 feet or
wide enough to permit operation of compaction equipment. The
side slopes shall be no steeper than 1:1. The trench shall be kept
free from standing water during the backfilling operations.
(11) Overflow system. An overflow system shall be provided to carry
flow to the detention basin when the capacity of the storm drain
pipe system is exceeded. The overflow system shall be of sufficient
capacity to carry the difference between the one-hundred year and
the ten-year peak flow rates.
B. Grading and landscaping of basins.
(1) Cuts and fills. No excavation or fill shall be made with a cut or fill
slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, except where
the excavation or fill is sufficiently stable to prevent sliding or
erosion and will not result in property damage or personal injury. A
written statement shall be required from a civil engineer licensed
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania having experience in soils
engineering certifying that he has inspected the site and that any
proposed deviation from the slope specified above should not
endanger any property or result in personal injury. Retaining walls
will be required if a stable slope cannot be maintained. Any
retaining wall design must be designed by an experienced
structural engineer licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and approved by the Township. The toe of any cut or fill slope must
be located a minimum of 15 feet from adjacent property lines, with
the exception stated above.
(2) Retention/detention basins shall be designed to utilize the natural
contours of the land whenever possible. When such design is

§ 110-11 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-11
1:248
§ 110-12. Plan requirements for recreational lands and facilities.
[Added 5-7-2008 by Ord. No. 120]
arrangement and approximate dimension of the streets, lots and other
proposed features, but shall not authorize the sale or transfer of lots, or
the development of land until construction is permitted to commence in
accordance with § 110-15 herein. Nor shall such approval constitute a
waiver or release, or assumption, by the Township of any requirements
of any Township ordinances, codes, regulations, plans or maps.
R. Every final plan approval shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1) The applicant shall execute a subdivision and land development

may provide water supply or sewage disposal facilities; and
pipeline easement holders or others.
A. Residential subdivisions and land developments.
(1) In reviewing a sketch plan, preliminary plan or preliminary/final
plan for a proposed subdivision or land development, other than a
one-lot residential subdivision, the Township Planning Commission
shall consider the needs of the prospective residents for
recreational lands and/or facilities, whether on-site or off-site, and
shall discuss its findings in relation to the requirements of this
section.
(2) The Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission, shall determine whether the public dedication of land
suitable for open space or recreation as intended by the developer;
or, upon agreement with the applicant or developer, the
construction of recreational facilities, the payment of fees in lieu of
setting aside such land, the private reservation of the land, or a
combination thereof, for park or recreation purposes is to be
imposed as a condition precedent to final approval of the plan. It is
the intent of the Township to further and more effectively
§ 110-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-12
1:249
implement the Chadds Ford Township Comprehensive Plan and the
Township Open Space Plan as they relate to open space, recreation,
and natural feature protection needs within Chadds Ford Township.
Residential development creates demands for local recreational
lands and facilities, and developers of residential land need to
contribute proportionately to meeting that demand. [Amended
9-4-2013 by Ord. No. 125]
(3) Land meeting other objectives.
(a) The Board of Supervisors, at its sole discretion, may determine
that land within the tract that meets other objectives can
satisfy some or all of the requirements of this section. It shall
be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate why such land is
a suitable alternative to recreational lands and/or facilities and
how such land will serve the residents of the development. In
reaching its decision, the Board shall evaluate the applicant's
proposal in relation to objectives and factors that may include,
among others:
[1] Opportunities for passive recreation.
[2] Protection of important and characteristic scenic and/or
natural features, particularly where such features are
delineated in the Chadds Ford Township Open Space Plan.
[3] Retention, creation, and/or improvement of important trail
linkages or corridors.
[4] Neighborhood or subneighborhood scale park areas
designed especially for the ages and needs of the
prospective new residents, e.g., tot lots, fitness trail, etc.
(b) The applicant must also demonstrate that the active
recreational needs of the residents are adequately addressed
by the applicant's proposal, and that the proposed alternative
is consistent with the Township's open space goals and
programs, including but not limited to those presented in the
Chadds Ford Township Open Space Plan.
(4) Where the Board of Supervisors determines that the preliminary
plan does not provide land and facilities meeting the criteria of
Subsection A(2) or (3) above, the Board of Supervisors may accept
a fee in lieu of the required recreational lands and facilities, as set
forth in Subsection A(8), below.
(a) The Board, in its sole discretion, may accept a combination of
land, facilities, and fee where that arrangement best meets the
purposes of this section and the needs of Township residents.
(b) Where a combination of land, facilities, and fee is proposed, the
applicant may request that, in determining the partial fee
§ 110-12 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-12
1:250
amount, the Board give appropriate credit for the value of any
improvements within the open space that may be proposed,
including trails. The Board may give the applicant credit for
some, all, or none of such value.
(5) In determining whether the applicant may pay a fee in lieu of
recreational lands and/or facilities within the proposed
development, the Board of Supervisors may, as it deems
appropriate, be guided by the following additional criteria:
(a) The provisions of the Township's Comprehensive Plan and
Open Space Plan.
(b) The proximity of the proposed development to existing or
proposed public open space and recreational areas.
(c) The natural and scenic characteristics of the tract on which the
development is proposed and their compatibility with active
and passive recreation.
(d) Any existing commitments of the Township to purchase or
improve land for open space and recreational purposes.
(6) The standards of this section are intended to apply to all residential
subdivisions and land developments, including applications
submitted for any single-family, two-family and multifamily
development, and mobile home parks.
(7) Where the Board determines that a set-aside of land and the
provision of recreational facilities within the tract proposed for
development will satisfy the requirements of this section, the
minimum amount of such land to be set aside shall be calculated on
the basis of one acre per 20 new dwelling units to be constructed
on the tract, or the proportional equivalent thereof. The type and
extent of recreational facilities shall be as determined appropriate
by the Board of Supervisors.
(8) Standards for the payment of fees in lieu of land and/or
recreational facilities.
(a) Where a fee is to be provided in lieu of the set-aside of land
and/or facilities for active recreation:
[1] The amount of the fee in lieu of recreational land shall be
equal to the fair market value of the land required by
Subsection A(7). The fair market value of one acre of land
shall be established by dividing the total Township
assessment of the previous year by the number of acres in
Chadds Ford Township, i.e., 5,568 acres. (By way of
example, the total assessment of Chadds Ford Township
for 2012 as established by the County of Delaware was
$533,017,484. $533,017,484 divided by 5,568 acres in
§ 110-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-12
1:251
Chadds Ford Township equals $95,728.71 per acre.
$95,728.71 divided by 20 units equals $4,786.00, the
amount of fee-in-lieu per dwelling unit.) [Amended
9-4-2013 by Ord. No. 125]
[2] The amount of the fee in lieu of recreational facilities shall
be equal to the amount determined by Subsection
A(8)(a)[1]. This fee shall be separate from and, where
applicable, in addition to the fee in lieu of recreational land
set forth in Subsection A(8)(a)[1]. The Board, at its sole
discretion, may accept a lesser fee amount for recreational
facilities, upon request of the applicant, based upon the
type, characteristics, and amounts of such facilities that
the Board would deem appropriate for the site. In so
determining, the Board may take into account the location
of the site, the recreational needs of the expected
population to be served, and the type and availability of
recreational facilities elsewhere in the Township.
[3] Where the Board of Supervisors determines that a
combination of land/facilities and fee is to be provided, the
amount of the fee shall be prorated in accordance with the
amount of land to be set aside and the value of facilities to
be provided.
(b) A note shall be placed on the plan submitted for final approval,
stipulating the amount of the fee to be paid, as established
through Subsection A(8)(a), and the means of payment,
consistent with Subsection A(8)(c).
(c) The full amount of the fee, as determined by Subsection
A(8)(a), shall be paid or otherwise secured in a manner deemed
acceptable by the Board of Supervisors, as a condition of final
plan approval and prior to recording the approved final plan.
(d) All fees received pursuant to this section shall be placed in a
special capital reserve fund for open space and recreation, the
purpose of which shall be to hold, invest and disburse such
monies. Disbursements from this fund shall be made from time
to time as the Board shall deem appropriate, only in
conjunction with the planning, purchase, improvement,
replacement, and addition to Township lands for use as open
space and recreation for the benefit of the citizens of the
Township as provided for in the Second Class Township Code59
or other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes. All sums
received for and deposited in the Open Space Fund shall be
held, invested, and reinvested in the same manner as other
funds of the Township, but shall not be considered part of the
general revenues of the Township.
59.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 65101 et seq.
§ 110-12 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-12
1:252
(9) Characteristics and design standards for recreational lands and
facilities. In designing lands for recreational purposes within the
subdivision or land development plan, the following criteria and
standards shall be adhered to by the applicant. Areas shall be:
(a) Consistent with the Township's Comprehensive Plan and the
Township's Open Space Plan.
(b) Suitable for recreational uses, unless deemed acceptable by
the Board for other purposes, and in any case without
interfering with adjacent dwelling units, parking, driveways,
and roads.
(c) Comprised of open land which contains none of the following
features: floodplains, woodlands, slopes exceeding 15%,
wetlands, and surface waters, except where the Board
specifically accepts land with such features as satisfying the
purposes of this section, consistent with Subsection A(3),
above.
(d) Interconnected with park land or with open space areas on
abutting parcels wherever possible.
(e) Comprised of areas not less than 100 feet in width and not less
than 15,000 square feet of contiguous area, except that the
minimum width may be reduced to not less than 10 feet where
that portion of the open space is being used solely as a trail
corridor.
(f) Provided with sufficient perimeter parking when necessary,
and with safe and convenient access by adjoining street
frontage or other rights-of-way or easements capable of
accommodating pedestrian, bicycle, maintenance equipment,
and other vehicular traffic, and containing appropriate access
improvements.
(g) Undivided by any public or private streets, except where
necessary for proper traffic circulation, and then only upon
recommendation of the Township Engineer and Township
Planning Commission.
(h) Free of all structures, except those related to outdoor
recreational use.
(i) Suitably landscaped, whether by retaining existing natural
cover and/or by a landscaping plan, for enhancing open space
areas through plantings which are consistent with the
purposes of this section and which minimize maintenance
costs.
(j) Where the land is not dedicated to the Township, the land shall
be made subject to the terms of a conservation easement for
§ 110-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-12
1:253
the purpose of preserving the open space land for the purposes
intended.
B. Nonresidential subdivisions and land developments.
(1) Statement of intent. The Board of Supervisors, upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission, shall require and
determine whether the public dedication of land, suitable for the
use intended, or, upon agreement with the applicant or developer,
the construction of recreational facilities, the payment of fees in
lieu of the public dedication of land, the private reservation of land,
or a combination thereof, for park or recreation purposes is to be
imposed as a condition precedent to final approval of the plan. It is
the intent of the Township to further and more effectively
implement the Chadds Ford Township Comprehensive Plan and the
Township Open Space Plan as they relate to open space, recreation,
and natural feature protection needs within Chadds Ford Township.
Nonresidential development creates additional demands upon local
recreational lands and facilities, and developers of nonresidential
land need to contribute proportionately to meeting that demand.
[Amended 9-4-2013 by Ord. No. 125]
(2) Required recreational lands and facilities or fees in lieu thereof.
(a) Except as exempted in Subsection B(2)(b), below, any proposed
nonresidential subdivision or land development shall provide
recreational lands and facilities. The Board of Supervisors may
accept, pursuant to Subsection A(4) herein, a fee in lieu of the
required recreational lands and facilities, and/or fees in lieu
thereof in accordance with the terms of this chapter. These
requirements are designed to address the demand for park and
recreational facilities resulting from the additional employees,
customers, and/or clients that will be generated by the
proposed development.
(b) Applications for subdivision or land development approval
where the principal uses are to be agricultural shall be exempt
from the provisions of this section.
(c) For commercial developments, the Board of Supervisors may
consider the permanent set-aside or dedication of on-site lands
and facilities, or a combination of land, facilities, and fees, or
the payment of a fee in lieu thereof. The applicant must
demonstrate how the chosen alternative will meet the
purposes of this subsection and the recreational demands
created by the proposed development. In deciding upon a
request, the Board shall also consider:
[1] Whether the location is especially important to
complement other existing or proposed recreational or
§ 110-12 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-12
1:254
open space lands, or to meet the needs of an area with
particularly strong demands;
[2] If the site is particularly well-suited in response to broader
public demand beyond that generated by the site itself;
[3] The potential relationship to future Township plans and
programs; and
[4] The factors in Subsection A(5), above.
(d) Where the Board determines that a set-aside of land and
facilities within the tract proposed for development will satisfy
the requirements of this section, the minimum amount of such
land to be set aside shall be calculated on the basis of 250
square feet of land meeting the criteria of this section to be set
aside per each 500 square feet of gross floor area, or portion
thereof, for the principal use of the property. The type and
extent of recreational facilities shall be as determined
appropriate by the Board of Supervisors.
(e) Characteristics and design of lands to be set aside shall be in
accordance with the standards in Subsection A(9), above.
(f) Responsibility for ownership and maintenance of on-site
recreational lands and trails facilities shall remain with the
developer or subsequent owner of the site, unless the Board
accepts an offer of dedication of some or all of the land.
(g) Where a fee is to be accepted in lieu of the set aside of land and
facilities: [Amended 12-14-2009 by Ord. No. 122; 9-4-2013
by Ord. No. 125]
[1] The amount of the fee-in-lieu of recreational land/
recreational facilities shall be equal to 250 square feet of
land to be set aside per each 500 square feet of gross floor
area or part thereof. The value of the land shall be
determined to be equal to the fair market value of one acre
of land in Chadds Ford Township as set forth in
§ 110-12A(8)(a)[1] above. [By way of example. . .the total
assessment of Chadds Ford for 2012 as established by the
County of Delaware was $533,017,484. $533,017,484
divided by 5,568 acres in Chadds Ford equals $95,728.71
per acre. $95,728.71 divided by 43,560 square feet
(number of square feet in an acre) equals $2.19 per square
foot.] The Board in its sole discretion may waive or accept
a lesser amount for recreational facilities, upon request of
the applicant, based upon the type, characteristics, and
amounts of such facilities that the Board would deem
appropriate for the site. In so determining, the Board may
take into account the location of the site, the recreational
needs of the expected population to be served, and the
§ 110-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-12
1:255
§ 110-13. Subdivision and land development agreement.
Every applicant who seeks to obtain final plan approval shall execute an

A. Within 90 days after the applicant executes the subdivision and land
development agreement and the completion guarantee, as set forth in
Article VI herein, the applicant shall thereupon cause one copy of the
final plan to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in and
for the County of Delaware, Pennsylvania, and shall notify the Board of
Supervisors in writing, certified mail return receipt requested, of the
date of such recording, and the Plan Book and page in which the same

characteristics.
§ 110-25 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-26
1:276
(2) The proposed street pattern and layout shall be properly and
logically related to the topography of the land with regard to
grades and conditions of drainage. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to existing grade.
(3) The proposed street pattern shall be designed to enhance views
from the road and to create a greater variety of lot appearance
through a curvilinear alignment.
(4) The proposed street pattern and layout shall provide suitable
access to each lot and permit safe and convenient circulation of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(5) Every lot shall abut on a public street, except that four or fewer
residential lots may use a shared driveway, and thereby share the
required minimum lot width at the street line. All setback
requirements from streets shall apply to shared driveways.
(6) Provisions shall be made for the extension and continuation of
major and minor collector streets and local primary streets into and
from adjoining areas, except when topographical or hydrological
conditions shall make the same impracticable.

or land development if the subdivision or land development adjoins
lands which may be developed in the future, and the same shall be
provided with easements for turnarounds.
(8) If lots resulting from subdivision are large enough to permit
resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided,
adequate street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be
provided as necessary.

permitted excepting where the control and disposal of the land
comprising such strips are placed within the jurisdiction of the
Township.
(10) Streets that are extensions of or in alignment with existing named
streets shall bear the names of such existing streets; new street
names shall not duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing
street names; and all street names shall be subject to the prior
approval of the Board of Supervisors and the Postmaster of the
local postal service districts.
(11) Where streets continue into adjoining municipalities, compatibility
of design, particularly with regard to cartway widths, shall be
employed to avoid abrupt changes in the cartway width or to other
improvements within the right-of-way.
(12) Streets shall be designed so as to avoid edge erosion through the
use of curbs and gutters as required in § 110-28 herein.
§ 110-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-26
1:277
B. Cul-de-sac streets shall be designed as follows:

or pavement line, and an additional ten-foot right-of-way outside
the pavement or curbline.
(2) The pavement width of the cartway leading to the turnaround shall
be a minimum of 24 feet and the right-of-way shall be a minimum of
50 feet. However, whenever a cul-de-sac is employed to service
industrial, commercial and institutional lots and/or land
development, then the minimum cartway width shall be 26 feet.
(3) When required for future extension, the turnaround right-of-way
shall be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with sufficient width
along the boundary line to permit extension of the street at full
width.
(4) Drainage of cul-de-sacs shall, whenever possible, be in the
direction of the open end thereof.
(5) All design standards in § 110-26C herein which are pertinent to culde-
sacs shall apply.

Township Engineer, shall evaluate proposed streets according to
their functional classification, as defined by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation for state-owned and -maintained
roads, and as defined by the Township for Township-owned and -
maintained roads, and review all plans, documents and profiles to
determine their conformance to the cartway and right-of-way width
and other standards set forth in this section for various types of
streets according to the classification which they deem to be most
appropriate and logical.
(2) The following right-of-way and cartway widths shall apply:
(a) Every major arterial street shall have an eighty-foot right-ofway

residential development, R-A or R-M District.64
(d) Every local secondary street and every loop street in or
adjacent to a residential subdivision or land development shall
contain a minimum right-of-way width of 50 feet and a
minimum cartway of 24 feet; however, for any such street
which serves less than nine lots, the cartway may be reduced
to 20 feet.
(e) Right-of-way widths in excess of the aforementioned standards
shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional
width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such
slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.
(f) Additional cartway widths may be required by the Board of
Supervisors in specific cases for the following:
[1] Public safety and convenience.
[2] Access to off-street parking in commercial and industrial
areas and for planned residential development projects

the EIA report process as set forth in Article VII, § 110-52C(11),
§ 110-26 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-26
1:280
and according to the traffic control standards of Chapter 135,
Zoning, said street or intersection shall be improved to the full
extent as required in § 110-26C(2), with the following
considerations:
(a) This requirement shall apply only to Township roads and those
sides of intersections which pertain to Township roads, unless
the state imposes certain requirements along roads which they
own and maintain.
(b) Should the tract border any undersized road or intersection on
only one side, then the improvements shall take place only on
the side of the road or intersection which is tangent to the
tract.

shall be determined by the Township Engineer.
(d) Land associated with the rights-of-way for undersized roads
and intersections shall be delineated, depicted and otherwise
noted on all subdivision and/or land development plans for the
subject tract and shall be offered for dedication with the
improvements associated therewith.
(19) When a subdivision or land development fronts on an existing
street having a right-of-way less than the minimum width required
in this chapter, an ultimate right-of-way line shall be established
with the following considerations:
(a) The distance of this ultimate right-of-way line from the center
line of the existing right-of-way shall be 1/2 the width of the
required minimum right-of-way.

(2) Crushed aggregate base course construction shall be performed in
accordance with PennDOT's Publication 408, Section 300, and the
following standards:
(a) The base shall be a crushed stone base course thoroughly
compacted to a depth of not less than eight inches after
compaction by roller. The coarse aggregate for crushed stone
base shall conform to the grading requirements of No. 4
aggregate. Fine aggregate shall conform to the grading
requirements of No. 1 aggregate.
(b) Before spreading any material, the landowner or developer
shall place a sufficient number of grade stakes to represent the
finished grade of the proposed street as shown on the
65.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 110-26 CHADDS FORD CODE § 110-27
1:282
approved plans and profiles. Said placement of stakes shall be
inspected by the Township Engineer.
(c) Prior to placing the coarse aggregate, a two-inch layer of
limestone screenings shall be spread over the subgrade to
serve as a bed for the coarse aggregate. This initial layer of
limestone screenings shall not be placed on a wet, frozen or
unsuitable subgrade.
(d) Coarse aggregate shall be spread uniformly on the prepared
bed as follows:
[1] Mechanical stone spreaders shall be used to spread the
material the full width of the base to the proposed curbs or
rolled gutters.
[2] In areas inaccessible to spreading equipment, the material
may be spread directly from trucks provided the
distribution is satisfactory to the Township Engineer.
[3] After each layer of material has been spread, it shall be
checked with approved templates and straightedges and
all irregularities shall be satisfactorily corrected prior to
rolling.
[4] The coarse material shall be rolled and thoroughly
compacted with a three-wheel, ten-ton roller. The rolling
shall begin at the sides and progress to the center of the
road. Rolling shall be parallel with the proposed center
line, uniformly lapping each preceding track, covering the
entire surface with the rear wheels and continuing until
the materials does not creep or wave ahead of the roller
wheels.
[5] Red flags shall be placed at the limits of satisfactorily
compacted coarse material. The flags shall be moved
ahead by the Township Engineer as additional material is
compacted, and no fine aggregate shall be spread over the
coarse material in advance of the flag marked sections.
(e) After the coarse aggregate has been satisfactorily rolled and
compacted, fine aggregate, suitably conditioned to assure
thorough filling of the voids in the coarse aggregate shall be
spread uniformly over the surface as follows:
[1] Approved mechanical equipment shall be used for
spreading the fine aggregate. However, in areas
inaccessible to spreading equipment, the Township
Engineer may permit manual spreading which shall be
performed in a sweeping motion with a square-pointed
shovel, alternately in opposite directions, until the voids
are completely filled.
§ 110-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-27
1:283
[2] Immediately following the aforementioned operation, the
fine material shall be broomed and rolled until the voids in
the coarse material are completely filled and the base
course is thoroughly compacted and firmly set. Brooms
attached to the roller and hand brooms shall be used to
uniformly spread the fine material.
[3] The rolling and brooming of the surface shall be continued
during the process of spreading the fine material. Rolling
shall begin at the sides and shall progress as stated in
§ 110-27A(2)(d)[4] herein.
[4] After the completion of the application and rolling of fine
materials, the surface shall be sprinkled with water and
rolled. The sprinkling and rolling shall be continued and
additional fine material applied where necessary until all
voids are filled and until a slight wave of grout forms in
front of the roller wheels. Brooms attached to the roller
and hand brooms shall be used to distribute the grout
uniformly into any unfilled voids. After the wave of grout
has been produced over the entire section of the base
course, this portion shall be left to dry. The quantity of fine
material and water used shall be determined by the
Township Engineer and shall be sufficient to provide a
smooth, hard monolithic surface.

Improvements
§ 110-39. Completion of improvements. [Amended 1-6-1992 by Ord.
No. 65B]
§ 110-40. Completion guarantee.
In lieu of the completion of the streets and other improvements required as
a condition for the final approval of the subdivision and/or land development
plan as set forth in §§ 110-11R and 110-39 herein, the landowner or
developer may deposit financial security acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors (except as set forth in § 110-40E, herein) in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements, estimated, calculated
and determined in accordance with the following:
A. No subdivision and/or land development application shall be finally
approved unless the streets shown on such plan have been improved to
a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition, or improved
as required by this chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street
lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm
sewers and other improvements as required by this chapter have been
installed in accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of
any improvements required as a condition for final plan approval,
including improvement or fees, the landowner or developer shall
deposit financial security with the Township in an amount sufficient to
cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities including,
but not limited to, roads, stormwater detention and/or retention basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which are or may be
required.
B. When requested by the landowner or developer, in order to facilitate
financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a
signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan
contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial
security. The final plan (record plan) shall not be signed nor recorded
until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution
or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within 90
days unless a written extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors.
Such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed
in writing at the request of the landowner or developer.
A. Such financial security shall include, but is not limited to, performance
bonds, surety bonds, federal or commonwealth chartered lending
institution irrevocable letters of credit, and restrictive or escrow
accounts in such lending institutions. Such bond or other security shall
provide for and secure to the Township the completion of all
improvements which may be required within one year or such other
§ 110-39 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-40
1:293
time that may be fixed by the Board of Supervisors for such completion.
Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution, provided said
company or institution is authorized to conduct such business within
the commonwealth.
B. Amount of security. [Amended 1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
(1) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the landowner or developer. The Township may
adjust the amount of the financial security annually, by comparing
the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed
and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after either the
original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of
completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may
require the landowner or developer to post additional security in
order to assure that the financial security equals said 110%. Any
additional security shall be posted by the landowner or developer
in accordance with this subsection.71
(2) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by a landowner or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the landowner or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township and landowner or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Township and the landowner or developer.
C. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting the financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary
date from the posting of financial security, or to an amount not
exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements
as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year
period through an estimate of costs as set forth in § 110-40B above.

§ 110-41. Release from improvement bond.
D. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by section
or stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as
to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development. As the work of installing the required improvements
proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request that the
Board of Supervisors release, or authorize the release, from time to
time, such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such request
shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors, whereupon,
the Board shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which
to allow the Township Engineer to certify in writing to the Board that
said improvements have been completed in accordance with the
approved plans. Upon such certification the Board of Supervisors shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an
amount as estimated by the Township Engineer, fairly representing the
value of the improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors
shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested.
The Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of
completion and certification by the Township Engineer, require 10% of
the estimated cost of the aforementioned improvements to be retained.
The Township Engineer, in certifying the completion of work for a
partial release, shall not be bound to the amount requested by the
developer, but shall certify to the Board of Supervisors an independent
evaluation of the proper amount of partial releases. [Amended
1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
E. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
other facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.

developer shall so notify the Board of Supervisors in writing, by
certified or registered mail, sending a copy thereof to the Township
Engineer. Within 10 days after receipt of such notice the Board of
Supervisors shall direct and authorize the Township Engineer to inspect

the Board of Supervisors, the Township Engineer shall file a report in
§ 110-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-41
1:295
writing of such inspection with the Board of Supervisors and shall
concurrently mail a copy thereof to the developer by certified or
registered mail. Such report shall be detailed and shall clearly and
specifically indicate approval or rejection of such improvement, either
in whole or in part, and if such improvements, or any part or portion
thereof, shall not be approved, or shall be rejected by the Township
Engineer, such report shall contain a statement of the reasons for such
nonapproval or rejection.
C. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the landowner or developer,
within 15 days of receipt of the Township Engineer's report, in writing
by certified or registered mail of the action of the Board of Supervisors
with relation thereto. [Amended 1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
D. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the landowner or developer
shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty
bond or other security agreement. [Added 1-6-1992 by Ord. No.
65B]
E. If any part or portion of the said improvements shall not be approved, or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the landowner or
developer shall correct and complete the same; and the same
procedure as set forth within this section shall be followed and applied.
[Amended 1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
F. The landowner or developer shall be responsible for maintenance of all
improvements until such improvements as are offered for dedication
are accepted by the Township. Ten percent of the completion guarantee
shall be retained as financial security until a maintenance guarantee as
provided for in § 110-44 herein has been posted and as-built plans are
verified and accepted by the Township Engineer. [Amended 1-6-1992
by Ord. No. 65B]
G. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Board may require
the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said
improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plan for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements. [Added
1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
H. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final plan approval, the
Township shall not condition the issuance of building, grading or other
permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,

1:296
§ 110-42. As-built plan submission.
Within 30 days after completion of improvements and approval of same by
the Township, and before acceptance of such improvements, the landowner
or developer shall submit to the Board of Supervisors a corrected set of asbuilt
plans and profiles in accordance with §§ 110-16 and 110-23 herein.
§ 110-43. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
[Amended 1-6-1992 by Ord. No. 65B]
In the event that any improvements which may be required under this
chapter have not been installed as provided in this chapter, or in accordance
with the approved final plan, the Board of Supervisors may enforce the
bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If
the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the
cost of installing or making repairs or correction to all the improvements
covered by such bond or security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or
land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to
recover from the land developer the monies necessary to complete the said
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from legal or equitable action brought against the landowner or developer,
or both, shall be used solely for the installation of improvements covered by
such security.
§ 110-44. Dedication and acceptance of improvements.
Upon completion of the construction of improvements in accordance with
the approved subdivision or land development plan; the following conditions
shall apply to the offer of dedication of the same and the acceptance thereof:
including buildings, upon the lots of land as depicted upon the final
plan upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the
approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been
provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected
shall not be withheld following the improvement of the streets
providing access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon
the approved final plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or
lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable
use of or occupancy of the building or buildings. [Added 1-6-1992 by
Ord. No. 65B]

§ 116-7. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,

§ 116-8. Excluded transactions.
of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer then the tax levied by Chadds Ford Township under the
authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
Chadds Ford Township, provided, however, that Chadds Ford Township
and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same
person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective
rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively
different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate
permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by section shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation which reconveyance may include property line
adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which Chadds Ford Township is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.
§ 116-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-8
1:321
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the property
or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether
or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named. A
trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws
of the intestate succession shall not disqualify a transfer from the
exclusion provided by this clause. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of a
living trust from the settlor of the living trust. No such exemption
shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a
copy of the living trust instrument.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
an ordinary trust to a specifically named beneficiary that is entitled
to receive the property under the recorded trust instrument or to a
contingent beneficiary where the transfer of the same property
would be exempt if the transfer was made by the grantor of the
property into the trust to that beneficiary. However, any transfer of
real estate from a living trust during the settlor's lifetime shall be
§ 116-8 CHADDS FORD CODE § 116-8
1:322
considered for the purposes of this article as if such transfer were
made directly from the settlor to the grantee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
a living trust after the death of the settlor of the trust or from a
trustee of a trust created pursuant to the will of a decedent to a
beneficiary to whom the property is devised or bequeathed.
(12) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from the trustee
of a living trust to the settlor of the living trust if such property was

successor trustee.
(14) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or agreement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(15) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.

record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(17) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt or the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
§ 116-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-8
1:323

real estate transferred.

commercial purposes.
(21) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, [68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its
primary purpose preservation of land for historic, recreational,
scenic, agricultural or open space opportunities; or a transfer from
such a conservancy to the United States, the commonwealth or to
any of their instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions; or
any transfer from such a conservancy where the real estate is
encumbered by a perpetual agricultural conservation easement as
defined by the act of June 30, 1981 (P.L. 128, No. 43), known as the
"Agricultural Area Security Law," and such conservancy has owned
the real estate for at least two years immediately prior to the

interest in a real estate company, family farm corporation or family
farm partnership which owns real estate.
(25) A transaction wherein the tax due is $1 or less.
(26) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Statement of
Value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation
under this article.

exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps

Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with Chadds Ford
Township's Tax Collector and with the person's employer affirming
that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and
net profits from all sources within Chadds Ford Township of less
than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have attached to
it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within Chadds Ford Township for the year prior to the
fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by Chadds Ford Township or except as
required by § 116-44A(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by Chadds Ford
Township.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by Chadds Ford Township that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within Chadds Ford
Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
§ 116-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-44

§ 116-45. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision. [Added 11-21-2011
by Ord. No. 123]
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for
that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within Chadds Ford Township in an amount equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under § 116-44B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
§ 116-44B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder
of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
§ 116-44B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for
that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and
Chadds Ford Township may pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in § 116-44B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
(5) Refunds shall be available within three years after the due date for
filing a return or one year after actual payment, whichever is later,
in conformity with the Local Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, for any
amounts paid in error or overpaid. This provision shall be
retroactive to January 5, 2009, the date the local services tax was
first enacted by the Township.
C. Refunds. Chadds Ford Township, in consultation with the Tax Collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. Chadds Ford Township or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
§ 116-44 CHADDS FORD CODE § 116-45
1:342
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person to
work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the
priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following
order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

types, and styles, including single-family detached dwellings; singlefamily
semidetached dwellings, two-family detached dwellings; singlefamily
attached dwellings; multifamily dwellings in the form of a
retirement residence; and mobile home park developments, so that the
demand for such housing may be met by greater variety in type, design
and layout of dwellings.
B. To encourage more efficient allocation, use and maintenance of open
space for conservation and active and passive recreation.
C. To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the practice and technology of land development so
that economies of scale may be so secured.
D. To encourage sensitive land development which will respect and
conserve such natural features and resources of the land as flood
hazard and flood-prone areas, steep and very steep slopes,
watercourses and water bodies, groundwater recharge areas, forested
areas, historic and cultural sites, visual resources, and other features of
importance to the vitality of natural and cultural resources.
E. To provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of
residential development to the particular site and to the particular
demand for housing existing at the time of development in a manner
consistent with the preservation of the property values, and to assure
that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development
established hereby is carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious and
fair administrative standards and procedures.

event, however, that tentative approval is granted subject to
conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a
copy of the official written communication of the Board, notify the
Board of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case the
Board shall be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the

tentative approval of the development plan, with all said
conditions, shall stand as granted.
B. The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of
fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for
the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public interest,
including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
(1) In those respects the development plan is or is not consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the Township;

which said design does or does not make adequate provision for
public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and
further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment;
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed PRD to the
neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established; and
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions

C. In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or
without conditions, the Board may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for final approval
of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development
plan which provides for development over a period of years, the periods
of time within which applications for final approval of each part thereof
shall be filed. Except upon the consent of the landowner, the time so
established between grant of tentative approval and an application for
final approval shall not be less than three months and, in the case of
developments over a period of years, the time between applications for
final approval of each part of a plan shall be not less than 12 months.

Zoning Map, effective upon final approval, and the same shall be noted
on the Zoning Map.
B. Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plan of the
PRD for recording nor authorize development or the issuance of any
building permits. A development plan which has been given tentative
approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with
conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and provided
that the landowner has not defaulted or violated any of the conditions of
the tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise
impaired by action of the Township pending an application or
applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner,
provided that an application for final approval is filed or, in the case of
development over a period of years, provided that applications are filed,

forty-five-day period shall be measured from the 30th day following the
day the application has been filed.
E. In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the Board may
refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 45 days from the date of
the regular meeting of the Board next following the date the application
is filed, so advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth

§ 135-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-41
1:439
the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the 30th day following

final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under
this section, be in the form and contain the findings required for an
application for tentative approval set forth in this article. Failure of
the Board to render a decision on an application for final approval
and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the
manner required by this section shall be deemed an approval of the
application for final approval, as presented, unless the applicant
has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the
decision, in which case, failure to meet the extended time or
change in manner of presentation of communication shall have like
effect.
F. A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the Board and shall be

any development shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon the
filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall
cease to apply thereto except as herein noted. Pending completion in
accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10508, of said PRD

development plan until after the said property is reclassified by
enactment of an amendment to this chapter in the manner prescribed
for such amendments in Article VI of the Municipalities Planning Code.
H. The final plot plan will be recorded by the landowner in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds in and for Delaware County, Pennsylvania, within 90

ARTICLE XV
Floodplain Conservation District
[Amended 8-26-2015 by Ord. No. 140]
§ 135-92. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,98 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of
its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of Chadds Ford Township
does hereby order as follows.
§ 135-93. General provisions.
A. Intent. The intent of this article is to:
(1) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
(2) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(3) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(4) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
(5) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
B. Applicability.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any
construction or development anywhere within Chadds Ford
Township unless a permit has been obtained from the floodplain
administrator.
(2) A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures.
C. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full
force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive.
If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this article, the
more restrictive shall apply.

§ 135-92 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-93
1:487
§ 135-94. Administration.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the article, which shall remain in full force and effect; and for this
purpose, the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside any identified
floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of Chadds Ford
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this article or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the floodplain administrator.

404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall be issued until this
determination has been made.
(3) In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the floodplain administrator shall review the
history of repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss
concerns can be addressed before the permit is issued.
(4) During the construction period, the floodplain administrator or
other authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine
that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable
municipal laws and ordinances. He/she shall make as many
inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.
(5) In the discharge of his/her duties, the floodplain administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or
development in the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of
proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the
provisions of this article.
(6) In the event the floodplain administrator discovers that the work
does not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws
and ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the floodplain administrator
shall revoke the permit and report such fact to the Board of
Supervisors for whatever action it considers necessary.
(7) The floodplain administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all
records associated with the requirements of this article, including,
but not limited to, finished construction elevation data, permitting,

I. Enforcement.
(1) Notices. Whenever the floodplain administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions
of this article, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the
floodplain administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation
as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
(a) Be in writing;
(b) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(c) Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for
the performance of any act it requires;
(d) Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case
may require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall
be deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or
agent when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by
any other method authorized or required by the laws of this
state;
(e) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will
effect compliance with the provisions of this article.
(2) Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or who fails or refuses to
comply with any notice, order or direction of the floodplain
administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality
shall be guilty of an offense and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine to
Chadds Ford Township of not less than $25 nor more than $600,
plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all
other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for
the proper enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or
penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this article
shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to
continue. All such persons shall be required to correct or remedy
such violations and noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any
development initiated or any structure or building constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated in noncompliance
with this article may be declared by the Board of Supervisors to be
a public nuisance and abatable as such.
J. Appeals.
(1) Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the floodplain
administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of
this article may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal
§ 135-94 CHADDS FORD CODE § 135-94
1:494
§ 135-95. Identification of floodplain areas.
must be filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision,
determination or action of the floodplain administrator.
(2) Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider the appeal in accordance with the Municipalities Planning
Code102 and any other local ordinance.
(3) Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board
may seek relief therefrom by appeal to court, as provided by the
laws of this state, including the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act.
A. Identification.
(1) The identified floodplain area shall be:
(a) Any areas of Chadds Ford Township classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and
the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated
November 18, 2009, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study; and
(b) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
(2) The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted by Chadds Ford
Township and declared to be a part of this article.
B. Description and special requirements of identified floodplain areas. The
identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
(1) The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(a) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
102. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 135-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-95
1:495
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
(2) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(a) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require
the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review
by the municipality.
(4) Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where Chadds Ford Township has identified local flood hazard or
ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a local flood hazard
map using best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils
or approximate study methodologies.
C. Changes in identification of area. The identified floodplain area may be
revised or modified by the Board of Supervisors where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the
need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally,
as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or
§ 135-95 CHADDS FORD CODE § 135-95
1:496
§ 135-96. Technical provisions.
scientific data. See § 135-96A(2) for situations where FEMA notification
is required.
D. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
floodplain administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Board of Supervisors. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.
E. Jurisdictional boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in
areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard
data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community
shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those
in 44 CFR 60.3.
A. General.
(1) Alteration or relocation of watercourses.
(a) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall
be made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities
which may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have
first been obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
(b) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall
be made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the
activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
(c) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development shall be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
(2) When Chadds Ford Township proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base
flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring
in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which
will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation;
or alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to
installing culverts and bridges):
(a) The applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12), apply to FEMA
for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur.
§ 135-95 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-96
1:497
(b) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed
encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA
of the adoption of floodplain management ordinances
incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
(c) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final
map revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance
with 44 CFR Part 67.

(1) Requests for variances shall be considered by Chadds Ford
Township in accordance with the procedures contained in § 135-94J

shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
[1] That there is good and sufficient cause.

[2] That failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
[3] That the granting of the variance will:
[a] Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited
increase in flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, or extraordinary public expense;
[b] Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or
local ordinances and regulations.
(h) A complete record of all variance requests and related actions
shall be maintained by Chadds Ford Township. In addition, a
report of all variances granted during the year shall be
included in the annual report to FEMA.

HARB at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
(2) In such case of an application being referred to the HARB, the
HARB may determine that the application meets the standards for

remedy the defects which led to the recommendation for disapproval,
then a new forty-five-day review period and procedure as described
above will apply.
A. The HARB may recommend against the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
rehabilitation, demolition, partial demolition or removal of any
structure within the historic districts which, in the HARB's opinion,

§ 135-131 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-133
1:519
permit for the erection, reconstruction, alteration, restoration,
rehabilitation, demolition or razing of all or a part of any building within
the historic districts, the HARB shall consider the following matters:
(1) The effect of the proposed change upon the general historic and
architectural nature of the district and all contributing resources.
(2) The appropriateness of exterior architectural features which can
be seen from a public street or way only.
(3) The general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the
building or structure and the relation of such factors to similar
features of buildings, structures, or contributing resources in the
district.
(4) Conformance to the provisions of §§ 135-136, 135-137 and 135-138,
and other requirements of this chapter pertaining to use
regulations, area bulk and height regulations, and structural
standards.

consider at least the following criteria in making its decision relative to
the appropriateness of the proposed action:
(1) Proportion of building's or structure's facades. [Amended

(2) Proportion and location of openings within the building or
structure. [Amended 7-2-2013 by Ord. No. 124]
(3) Location and scale of entrances and/or porch projections.
(4) Relationship to existing colors, textures and materials.
(5) Consistency of architectural detailing.
(6) Consistency in the appearance of roof lines and shapes.
(7) Appropriateness and consistency of landscaping.
(8) Overall scale.
(9) Overall site planning and spatial definition produced by the
location and placement of structures.
(10) Relationship to existing building heights.
(11) Relationship to the front, rear and side yard setbacks of existing
buildings or structures. [Amended 7-2-2013 by Ord. No. 124]

appropriateness and consistency of the proposed action relative to
the existing character within the registered historic districts.
§ 135-133 CHADDS FORD CODE § 135-133
1:520
D. The HARB shall also consider the degree to which the proposed work
complies with the Standards for Rehabilitation of the U.S. Department
of the Interior in making a decision relative to the appropriateness of
the proposal whenever rehabilitation work is proposed. The following
standards shall be used: [Amended 7-2-2013 by Ord. No. 124]
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be
based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.

§ 135-160. Buffer area standards.
§ 135-161. Landscaping requirements.
A. Buffer areas, as defined in Article II and required in various districts,
shall be adjacent to a property boundary.
B. Buffer areas shall be landscaped and maintained in accordance with
§ 135-161 with a buffer planting strip which forms a continuous visual
buffer. In the event the buffer planting strip does not provide a
continuous visual buffer due to site topography and visibility conditions,
the required plantings shall be placed upon a berm to elevate their
effectiveness.
C. All plantings shall be installed and maintained for the full width
required in a particular district, except that certain structures may be
placed within the buffer area, including:
(1) The required landscape treatment such as berms, fences, or walls
which aid in screening and do not conflict with the character of
adjoining properties or block the clear sight distance required at
intersections.
(2) Appurtenant landscaping structures, such as tree wells, tree
guards and tree grates, and retaining walls used to preserve stands
of existing trees or used for other functional purposes.
(3) Roads and/or driveways which provide direct ingress/egress for the
tract, including appurtenant structures within such road rights-ofway
such as curbs, sidewalks, and signs, which shall be landscaped
in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(4) Underground utilities.
(5) No structures other than those set forth in this Subsection C shall
be placed within a buffer area, and no parking of any kind shall be
permitted within the required buffer area.
(6) All existing deciduous and evergreen trees above two inches in
caliper and/or six feet in height shall be preserved in the buffer
areas, except where clearance is required to insure sight distance.
A. All required landscaping shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with a landscaping plan approved by the Board of
Supervisors. A landscaping plan shall depict all proposed plantings as
required within buffer areas in the form of a buffer planting strip, and in
other landscaped areas which relate to, complement, screen or
accentuate buildings, roads, parking areas, sidewalks, walkways,
§ 135-160 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-161
1:571
sitting areas, service or maintenance structures, courtyards, and other
site features.
B. The landscaping plan shall be submitted at the time when all other
required applications and/or plans are submitted. It shall be based on
and reflect the following:
(1) The functional and aesthetic factors which relate to the tract, and
to the principal and accessory buildings and other structures.
(2) Concealing views to the tract.
(3) Enhancing views from and within the tract.
(4) Screening and complementing proposed buildings and other
structures.
(5) Creating visual interest for the users and/or residents of the
proposed project.
(6) Using plant materials which are hardy and acclimated to the
conditions at the tract and within the Township.
C. The landscaping plan shall include notes, diagrams, sketches, or other
depictions to present the consideration and analysis of the following:
(1) An analysis of the site in terms of the existing views to and from the
areas which are proposed for development; existing topography
and vegetation conditions; and other existing conditions which are
relevant to the site.
(2) An analysis of proposed planting and other landscaping needs as
related to screening views of buildings; screening buildings and
sections of buildings; screening parking areas and other areas
where vehicles are parked; screening storage areas; screening site
utilities; and other appropriate types of screening.
(3) The consideration of locations where plantings and other
landscaping is needed to provide visual interest; define outdoor
spaces; complement the proposed architectural style; and achieve
other functional and aesthetic requirements for buffer areas, buffer
planting strips, and other landscaped areas.
(4) The intent to preserve existing trees wherever possible. The
protection of trees 12 inches or more in caliper (measured at a
height 4 1/2 feet above the original grade) shall be demonstrated as
a factor for determining the location of buildings, open space,
structures, underground utilities, walks, paved areas and other
structures. Areas in which trees are to be preserved shall remain at
original grade level and in an undisturbed condition.

coverage or capacity and no other viable alternatives exist. The
existence or nonexistence of a gap in wireless coverage or capacity
shall be a factor in the Township Board of Supervisors' decision on
an application for approval of the proposed facility.
(2) If the applicant proposes to construct a new communications tower
or a new communications antenna, the applicant shall provide
written evidence that it first considered land, buildings, and traffic
lights owned by the Township to place the proposed facility and
that such placement would not infill the applicant's gap in coverage
or capacity. The applicant shall further provide evidence that it
contacted the owners of tall structures within a one-mile radius of
the proposed communications tower, or a one-quarter-mile radius
from a proposed antenna, requested permission to install the
antenna on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than
economic ones. Tall structures shall include, but not be limited to,
smokestacks, water towers, buildings in excess of four stories,
wireless support structures of other communications antennas,
cellular communications and personal communications service
providers, other communications towers (fire, police, etc.), and
other similar tall structures.
(3) The applicant shall demonstrate that the height of the proposed
communications tower or communications antenna is the minimum
required to function satisfactorily. No taller height than this
minimum height shall be approved, unless the applicant provides
proof that another provider of wireless services has already agreed
to collocate on the applicant's wireless support structure or
communications tower at a greater height than is required by the
applicant.
(4) The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed communications
antenna or communications tower is safe and the surrounding
properties will not be negatively affected by structural failure,
falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields, or radio
frequency interference. All communications towers shall be fitted
with anticlimbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.
(5) In order to reduce the number of communications towers needed in
the Township in the future, the proposed communications tower
shall be required to accommodate, where possible, other users,
113. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 11702.1 et seq.

Communications Commission to provide wireless communications,
cellular communications, personal communications and/or
electronic networking services.
(7) Engineer certification. In the case of a proposed communications
tower, a structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall issue
to the Township a written certification of the such tower's ability to
meet the structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication Industry
Association and certify the proper construction of the foundation
and the erection of the structure. This certification shall be
provided during the conditional use proceedings before the
Township Board of Supervisors or, at a minimum, be made as a
condition attached to any approval given such that the certification
be provided prior to issuance of any building permits. All other
plans and drawings of a proposed wireless communications facility
shall contain a seal and signature of a professional structural
engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
I. Landscaping.
(1) Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible.
(2) Landscaping shall be required to screen and buffer as much of the
communications tower and/or related equipment as possible.

developed land, residential zoning districts, public land, or streets,
the perimeter shall be landscaped with at least one row of
deciduous trees, not less than 3 1/2 inches in caliper, spaced not
more than 30 feet apart, on center, and within 25 feet of the cell
site boundary, as well as at least one row of evergreen trees or
shrubs, at least 14 feet high when planted and spaced not more
than 15 feet apart and within 40 feet of the cell site boundary.
Alternatives such as walls or solid fences constructed of wood or
stone, of at least eight feet in height, may be permitted by the
Board of Supervisors based on security or other reasons.
(4) Appearance.
(a) Wireless communications facilities shall employ stealth
technology in order to be aesthetically and architecturally
compatible with the surrounding environment. Proposed
wireless communications facilities shall maximize the use of a
like facade to blend with the existing surroundings and

1:593
neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. The
application of the stealth technology chosen by the applicant
shall be subject to the approval of the Township Board of
Supervisors. Additionally, the Board of Supervisors shall
consider whether its decision upon the subject application will
promote the harmonious and orderly development of the
zoning district and/or surrounding area involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by
preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of
the community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the
site to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound
engineering and construction principles, practices and
techniques.

coverage or capacity shall be a factor in the Township's decision on
an application for approval of tower.
(2) Evidence that the proposed communications tower must be located
where it is proposed in order to serve the applicant's service area
and that no other viable alternative location exists; evidence that
the applicant cannot adequately extend or infill its communications
115. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 11702.1 et seq.
§ 135-170.1 CHADDS FORD CODE § 135-170.1

system by the use of equipment such as redoes, repeaters,
antennas, and other similar equipment installed on existing
structures, such as utility poles or their appurtenances and other
available tall structures.
(3) A technical evaluation of the feasibility of constructing the
proposed wireless communications facility on land owned and
maintained by Chadds Ford Township. If the applicant proposes to
construct a new communications tower or communications
antenna, the applicant shall provide written evidence that it first
considered land, buildings, and traffic lights owned by the
Township to place the proposed facility and that such placement
would not infill the applicant's gap in coverage or capacity. The
Township Board of Supervisors may deny a conditional use
application to construct a new communications tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount an antenna on
property owned by the Township.
(4) If the proposed wireless communications facility cannot be sited on
land, traffic signals, or buildings owned by the Township, the
applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures, buildings, approved wireless support structures, and
existing communications towers within a one-quarter-mile radius of
the site proposed for the communications tower or antenna, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings,
and/or towers and was denied for one of the following reasons:
(a) The proposed communications antenna and related equipment
would exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed communications antenna and related equipment
would cause radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.
(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.
(5) A signal coverage/propagation map of the area to be served by the
proposed communications tower. The propagation shall show
signal intensity in dBm, as well as major roads, residential
developments, and commercial areas. The Township reserves the
right to request propagation maps for other sites or height
alternatives.
§ 135-170.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-170.1
1:597
(6) Certifications that the proposed tower shall comply with all
applicable state and federal regulations, as well as all pertinent
provisions enumerated herein.
F. Location and development standards.
(1) Available infrastructure. As part of its application for approval, the
applicant must demonstrate that it cannot infill the capacity or
coverage gap in its system by utilizing existing infrastructure (i.e.,
utility or light poles) in the public rights-of-way as a support
structure for a communications antenna, rather than constructing
a new communications tower. To the extent permissible under state
and federal law, communications antennas attached to existing
infrastructure shall not exceed six feet in height and shall employ
stealth technology, if possible, in their design.
(2) Communications towers in the right-of-way shall not exceed a
height comparable to the average height of utility poles or
electrical poles within a two-block radius of the proposed facility,
unless the applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the Township
Board of Supervisors that a taller tower is the only method by
which the applicant can infill its gap in coverage or capacity.
(3) Communications towers are prohibited within 75 linear feet of
areas in which all utilities are located underground.
(4) Communications towers shall not be located in the front facade
area of any structure.
(5) Communications towers are prohibited in the F-P Flood Plain
Overlay District.
G. Design regulations.
(1) The communications tower or communications antenna shall
employ the most current stealth technology available in an effort to
appropriately blend into the surrounding environment and
minimize aesthetic impact. The application of the stealth
technology chosen by the applicant shall be subject to the approval
of the Township Board of Supervisors.
(2) To the extent permissible under state and federal law, any height
extensions to an existing communications tower wireless support
structure shall require prior approval of the Township, and shall
not violate the provisions described herein.
(3) Communications towers shall be designed structurally, electrically,
and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's
communications antennas and comparable communications
antennas for the maximum amount of future users based on the
size of the proposed communications tower.
§ 135-170.1 CHADDS FORD CODE § 135-170.1
1:598
H. Equipment location. Towers and related equipment shall be located so
as not to cause any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian or
vehicular traffic, or to otherwise create safety hazards to pedestrians
and/or motorists or to otherwise inconvenience public use of the rightof-
way as determined by the Township. In addition:
(1) To the extent technologically feasible, ground-mounted related
equipment shall be located within two feet of the public right-ofway.
For reasons of safety and aesthetics, such equipment shall
neither protrude onto the curb nor obstruct the sidewalk in areas
where sidewalks abut the public rights-of-way.
(2) Required electrical meter cabinets shall be screened to blend in
with the surrounding area to the satisfaction of the Township Board
of Supervisors.
(3) Any graffiti on the tower or on any related equipment shall be
removed at the sole expense of the owner within 14 days of
notification.
(4) Any underground vaults related to communications towers shall be
reviewed and approved by Township Board of Supervisors.
I. Time, place and manner. The Township shall determine the time, place
and manner of construction, maintenance, repair and/or removal of all
towers in the right-of-way based on public safety, traffic management,
physical burden on the right-of-way, and related considerations. For
public utilities, the time, place and manner requirements shall be
consistent with the police powers of the Township and the requirements
of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code.116
J. Engineer certification. A structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania
shall issue to the Township a written certification of the proposed
tower's ability to meet the structural standards offered by either the
Electronic Industries Association or the Telecommunication Industry
Association and certify the proper construction of the foundation and
the erection of the structure.
K. Stealth technology. Towers and antennas shall employ stealth
technology and shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible
with the surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a like
facade to blend with the existing surroundings and neighboring
buildings to the greatest extent possible. The Township Board of
Supervisors shall consider whether its decision upon the subject
application will promote the harmonious and orderly development of
the zoning district and/or surrounding area involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development existing in the
area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a negative impact
on the aesthetic character of the community; preserve woodlands and
trees existing at the site to the greatest possible extent; and encourage
116. Editor's Note: See 66 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.

sound engineering and construction principles, practices and
techniques.
L. Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible under
applicable state and federal law, the proposed modification of an
existing communications tower, which substantially changes the
wireless support structure or is not an eligible facilities request, shall
first obtain a building permit from the Township. Nonroutine
modifications shall be prohibited without such permit.
M. Public safety communications. No communications tower shall interfere
with public safety communications or the reception of broadband,
television, radio or other communication services enjoyed by occupants
of nearby properties.
N. Maintenance. Towers shall be fully automated and unattended on a
daily basis and shall be visited only for maintenance or emergency
repair. Such maintenance shall be performed to ensure the upkeep of
the tower in order to promote the safety and security of the Township's
residents, and utilize the best available technology for preventing
failures and accidents.
O. Historic properties. To the extent permissible under state and federal
law, no tower or antenna may be located upon any property, or on a
building, structure that is listed on either the National or Pennsylvania
Register of Historic Places, overseen by the Township HARB, or that is
deemed by the Township to be of local historic significance. No tower in
the public rights-of-way shall be located along a highway or other road
that is considered by the Township to be a scenic route, including the
Brandywine Valley Designated Scenic Byway and Creek Road.
P. Signs. All towers shall post a sign in a readily visible location identifying
the name and phone number of a party to contact in the event of an
emergency. The only other signage permitted on the tower shall be that
required by the FCC, or any other federal or state agency.
Q. Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, except as required by
law. If lighting is required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan
for sufficient lighting, demonstrating as unobtrusive and inoffensive an
effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. The
applicant shall promptly report any outage or malfunction of FAAmandated
lighting to the appropriate governmental authorities and to
the Township Manager. This requirement shall not apply to towers
employing stealth technology in the right-of-way that are designed to
resemble streetlights.
R. Noise. Towers shall be operated and maintained so as not to produce
noise in excess of applicable noise standards under state law and the
Township Code, except in emergency situations requiring the use of a
backup generator, where such noise standards may be exceeded on a
temporary basis only.

S. Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days following written
notice from the Township, or such longer period as the Township
determines is reasonably necessary or such shorter period in the case
of an emergency, the owner of a tower in the right-of-way shall, at its
own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or
alter the position of any tower when the Township, consistent with its
police powers and applicable Public Utility Commission regulations,
shall determine that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is
reasonably necessary under the following circumstances:
(1) The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
Township or other public improvement in the right-of-way;
(2) The operations of the Township or other governmental entity in the
right-of-way;
(3) Vacation of a street or road or the release of a utility easement; or
(4) An emergency as determined by the Township.
T. Permit fees. The Township may assess appropriate and reasonable
permit fees directly related to the Township's actual costs in reviewing
and processing the application for approval of a new tower, as well as
related inspection, monitoring, and related costs.
A. To assure quality standards and safety, the following provisions shall
apply:
(1) The outdoor dining area shall be directly abutting and on the same
lot as the principal building in which the associated restaurant is
located.
(2) All outdoor dining areas shall be subject to compliance with all
applicable health, building, zoning, accessibility, fire, and plumbing

Hearing Board shall hear challenges to the validity of this chapter or
the Zoning Map as follows:
(1) A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which
he has an interest shall submit the challenge to either the Zoning
Hearing Board or the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land
of another by this chapter or the Zoning Map, or any provision
thereof, who desires to challenge its validity shall submit their
challenge pursuant to the Sections 909.1 and 609.1 of Act 247, as

1:606
(3) In addition to the procedures set forth in Section 916.1 of the
Municipalities Planning Code,120 in all such challenges the Zoning
Hearing Board shall decide all contested questions and shall make
findings on all relevant issues of fact and of interpretation, and
submit such findings as part of the record on appeal to the court.
B. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may grant a variance, provided that the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located;
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare; and
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief, and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation or ordinance in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter and the Municipalities Planning Code.
C. Special exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide special exceptions
in accordance with the standards set forth below; and, in granting
special exceptions, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may

thereunder within six additional months, it shall be conclusively presumed
that the applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his/her application;
(1) Whenever the Board hears a special exception for uses specified in
this chapter, the standards of § 135-164A and B shall apply. Special
exceptions related to the Floodplain Conservation District shall be
evaluated in accordance with § 135-97.
(2) The applicant shall submit a report to evidence proof of compliance
with the standards and criteria of § 135-164A and B.
