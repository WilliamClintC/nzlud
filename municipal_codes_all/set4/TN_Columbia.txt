PREFACE
The Columbia Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of
the ordinances of the City of Columbia, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin
of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the
section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
iii
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Linda Dean, the Administrative Specialist who did
all the typing on this project is gratefully acknowledged.

certificate and the certificate shall be issued when a majority of the members of
the city council have signed it.
(2) Any person intending to apply for a state license for the sale of
wine at a retail food store shall first apply for a certificate of compliance from

of the date of the certificate, or if the retail food store for which a certificate was
granted is not in operation within twelve (12) months following the issuance of
the certificate; provided, however, that the mayor or a majority of the city
council may, upon written request of the applicant, extend the expiration date
of a certificate for up to three additional months in the event of circumstances
beyond the applicant's control. If a certificate becomes void, no new certificate
may be issued to the same applicant unless a new application is submitted and
all applicable requirements of this article are met at the time the new
application is received. (1968 Code, § 2-103, as deleted by Ord. #3988, June
2014, and added by Ord. #4096, Dec. 2016)

application, and any change of location of said business shall be cause for
immediate revocation of said certificate by the city manager, unless the new
location is approved in writing by the city manager. (1968 Code, § 2-104, as
deleted by Ord. #3988, June 2014, and added by Ord. #4096, Dec, 2016)

Change 7, June 14, 2018 8-5
(2) Misrepresentation of a material fact, or concealment of a material
fact required to be shown in the application for a certificate, shall be a violation
of this article. The city may refuse to issue a certificate if, upon investigation,
the city finds that the applicant for a certificate has concealed or misrepresented
in writing or otherwise any material fact or circumstance concerning the
operation of the business, or if the interest of any person in the operation of the
business is not truly stated in the application, or in case of any fraud or false
statements by the applicant pertaining to any matter relating to the operation
of the business. All data, written statements, affidavits, evidence or other
documents submitted in support of an application are a part of the application.
(3) If the provisions of this section are alleged to have been violated,
the city may revoke any certificate which has been issued, after first providing
an opportunity for the applicant or licensee to refute such allegations and/or to
show cause why the certificate should not be revoked. Revocation of a certificate
for a retail liquor store shall require a majority vote of the city council. The
mayor may revoke a certificate for the sale of wine at a retail food store,
provided that the applicant or licensee may appeal the revocation to the city
council, which may reverse the mayor's action by majority vote. (1968 Code,

(3) If, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-3-204(e)(7), a
manufacturer of high alcohol content beer, obtains a retail license to sell its
products which are manufactured on the manufacturer's premises, the
inspection fee shall be fifteen percent (15%) to inspect the retail store in which
such products are sold by the manufacturer. Such inspection fee shall be
imposed on the wholesale price of the high alcohol content beer supplied
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-3-204(e)(7)(B) by a wholesaler for
those products manufactured and sold by the manufacturer at its retail store as
authorized pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-3-204(e)(7).
(4) Each wholesaler and manufacturer shall collect and remit the
inspection fee to the city at such times and in such manner as the city manager

or pay over to the city recorder any inspection fee, the city manager shall report

8-109. City manager may examine books, papers, etc., of dealers.
The city manager is authorized to examine the books, papers, and records of any
dealer for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of this chapter are
being complied with. Any refusal to permit the examination of any of such
books, papers, and records, or the investigation and examination of such
premises, shall constitute sufficient reason for the revocation of a license or the
refusal to issue a license. (1968 Code, § 2-109, as replaced by Ord. #4096, Dec.
2106)
8-110. Chapter not applicable to beer. No provision of this chapter

calendar days would pose an imminent threat to the health, safety or welfare of
persons or property in the adjacent area.
(3) Upon the levy of a fine pursuant to subsection (1), the hearing
officer shall within seven (7) business days, provide via certified mail notice to
the alleged violator of:

within seven (7) business days of receipt of the notice required in subsection (3).
(5) If an alleged violator demonstrates to the issuing officer's
satisfaction that the allegations contained in the citation have been remedied
to the issuing officer's satisfaction, the fine levied pursuant to subsection (1)
shall not be imposed or if already imposed cease; and the hearing date, if the
hearing has not yet occurred, shall be cancelled. (as added by Ord. #3956, Oct.

party in default, the administrative hearing officer shall include in the final
order a written notice of default and a written statement of the grounds for the
default. (as added by Ord. #3956, Oct. 2013)

the hearing, at least seven (7) business days before the hearing;
(b) The petition states facts demonstrating that the petitioner's
legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other legal interest may be
determined in the proceeding or that the petitioner qualifies as an
intervenor under any provision of law; and
(c) The administrative hearing officer determines that the
interests of justice and the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings
shall not be impaired by allowing the intervention.
(2) If a petitioner qualifies for intervention, the administrative hearing
officer may impose conditions upon the intervenor's participation in the
proceedings, either at the time that intervention is granted or at any subsequent
time. Conditions may include:
(a) Limiting the intervenor's participation to designated issues
in which the intervenor has a particular interest demonstrated by the
petition;
(b) Limiting the intervenor's participation so as to promote the
orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings; and

issues, the administrative hearing officer shall afford to all parties the

cross-examination, and submit rebuttal evidence, except as restricted by a
limited grant of intervention or by the pre-hearing order.
(3) In the discretion of the administrative hearing officer and by
agreement of the parties, all or part of the hearing may be conducted by
telephone, television or other electronic means, if each participant in the hearing
has an opportunity to participate in, to hear, and, if technically feasible, to see
the entire proceedings while taking place.
Change 5, June 12, 2014 12-26
(4) The hearing shall be open to public observation pursuant to title
8, chapter 44 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, unless otherwise provided by
state or federal law. To the extent that a hearing is conducted by telephone,
television or other electronic means, the availability of public observation shall
be satisfied by giving members of the public an opportunity, at reasonable time,
to hear the tape recording and to inspect any transcript produced, if any. (as
added by Ord. #3956, Oct. 2013)
12-1013. Evidence and affidavits; notice. (1) In an administrative
hearing:
(a) The administrative hearing officer shall admit and give
probative effect to evidence admissible in a court, and when necessary to
ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible to proof under the rules of
court. Evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted if it is of a
type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of

opposing party, within seven (7) business days after delivery, delivers to
the proponent a request to cross-examine an affiant, the opposing party's
right to cross-examination of such affiant is waived and the affidavit, if
introduced in evidence, shall be given the same effect as if the affiant had
testified orally. If an opportunity to cross-examine an affiant is not
afforded after a proper request is made as provided in this subdivision (b),
the affidavit shall not be admitted into evidence. "Delivery,'' for purposes
of this section, means actual receipt;
(c) The administrative hearing officer may admit affidavits not
submitted in accordance with this section where necessary to prevent
injustice;
(d) Documentary evidence otherwise admissible may be received
in the form of copies or excerpts, or by incorporation by reference to

cross-examine such affiant. To be effective, your request must be
mailed or delivered to _______________________ (here insert name
of proponent or the proponent's attorney) on or before

after the date of mailing or delivering the affidavit to the opposing
party). (as added by Ord. #3956, Oct. 2013)
12-1014. Final orders. (1) An administrative hearing officer shall
render a final order in all cases brought before his or her body.
(2) A final order shall include conclusions of law, the policy reasons
therefor, and findings of fact for all aspects of the order, including the remedy
prescribed. Findings of fact, if set forth in language that is no more than mere
repetition or paraphrase of the relevant provision of law, shall be accompanied
by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts of record to support
the findings. The final order must also include a statement of the available
procedures and time limits for seeking reconsideration or other administrative
relief and the time limits for seeking judicial review of the final order.
(3) Findings of fact shall be based exclusively upon the evidence of
record in the adjudicative proceeding and on matters officially noticed in that
proceeding. The administrative hearing officer's experience, technical
competence and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of
evidence.
(4) If an individual serving or designated to serve as an administrative
hearing officer becomes unavailable, for any reason, before rendition of the final
order, a qualified substitute shall be appointed. The substitute shall use any
Change 5, June 12, 2014 12-28
existing record and may conduct any further proceedings as is appropriate in the
interest of justice.

designated amount of time after conclusion of the hearing for the submission of
proposed findings.
(6) A final order rendered pursuant to subsection (1) shall be rendered

12-1017. Judicial review of final order. (1) A person who is
aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, title 6, chapter 54, part 10, which shall
be the only available method of judicial review.
(2) Proceedings for judicial review of a final order are instituted by
filing a petition for review in the chancery court in the county where the
municipality lies. Such petition must be filed within sixty (60) calendar days
after the entry of the final order that is the subject of the review.
(3) The filing of the petition for review does not itself stay enforcement
of the final order. The reviewing court may order a stay on appropriate terms,
but if it is shown to the satisfaction of the reviewing court, in a hearing that
shall be held within ten (10) business days of a request for hearing by either
party, that any party or the public at large may suffer injury by reason of the
granting of a stay, then no stay shall be granted until a good and sufficient
bond, in an amount fixed and approved by the court, shall be given by the
petitioner conditioned to indemnify the other persons who might be so injured
and if no bond amount is sufficient, the stay shall be denied.
(4) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after service of the petition, or
within further time allowed by the court, the administrative hearing officer

shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire
record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all the parties of the
review proceedings, the record may be sho11ened. A party unreasonably
refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the
additional cost. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or
additions to the record.
(5) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court
for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the
court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons
for failure to present it in the administrative proceeding, the court may order
that the additional evidence be taken before the administrative hearing officer
upon conditions determined by the court. The administrative hearing officer
may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and
shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with the
reviewing court.
(6) The procedure ordinarily followed in the reviewing court will be
followed in the review of contested cases decided by the administrative hearing
officer, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The administrative hearing
officer that issued the decision to be reviewed is not required to file a responsive
pleading.
(7) The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall
be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before
the administrative hearing officer, not shown in the record, proof thereon may
be taken in the court.
(8) The court may affirm the decision of the administrative hearing
officer or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or
modify the decision if the rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because
the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:
(a) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
(b) In excess of the statutory authority of the administrative
hearing officer;
(c) Made upon unlawful procedure;
(d) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or
(e) Unsupported by evidence that is both substantial and
material in the light of the entire record. In determining the
substantiality of evidence, the court shall take into account whatever in
the record fairly detracts from its weight, but the court shall not
substitute its judgment for that of the administrative hearing officer as
to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.
(9) No administrative hearing decision pursuant to a hearing shall be
reversed, remanded or modified by the reviewing court unless for errors that
affect the merits of such decision.

obtain a review of any final judgment of the chancery court under this chapter
by appeal to the Court of Appeals of Tennessee.
(2) The record certified to the chancery court and the record in the
chancery court shall constitute the record in an appeal. Evidence taken in court
pursuant to title 24 shall become a part of the record.

against the owner through an action for debt filed in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The city may bring one action for debt against more than one or all
the owners of the properties against whom such costs and administrative fees
have been assessed, and the fact that multiple owners have been joined in one
action shall not be considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties. Upon the
filing of the notice with the office of the register of deeds of the county in which
the property lies, the costs and administrative fees shall be a lien on the
property in favor of the city, second only to liens of the state, county, and
municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality for special assessments and
any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded or duly perfected
by filing of such notice. These costs and administrative fees shall be collected
by the city at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are
collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs and administrative fees, they shall
be collected at the same time and in the same manner as delinquent property
taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as
delinquent property taxes. The city manager or the person designated by him
or her may make rules and regulations necessary for the administration and
enforcement of this section, and shall report such rules and regulations to city
council. The city shall provide for a hearing upon request of the person
aggrieved by the determination as herein above set forth. Failure to make the
request within the time provided shall without exception constitute a waiver of
the right to a hearing.
(3) Any person aggrieved by an order or an act as a result of the
hearing provided hereunder may seek judicial review of the order or act.
(4) The provisions of this section do not apply to any parcel of property
upon which an owner-occupied residence is located. The owner of record of the
owner occupied property shall be notified that if the noted condition is not
remedied within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice, the building official shall
have the authority to issue a citation against the owner of record. Each day in
violation shall constitute a separate offense.

its MS4 storm water design and Best Management Practices (BMP)
Change 7, June 14, 2018 14-7
manuals for stormwater management, the following publications, which
are incorporated by reference in this ordinance as if fully set out herein:
(i) For construction site stormwater runoff pollutant
control, "TDEC - Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control
Handbook"; most current edition,
(ii) For post construction stormwater runoff and,
"Tennessee Permanent Stormwater Management and Design
Guidance Manual"; most current edition,
(iii) A collection of approved BMPs developed or collected
by the City of Columbia that comply with the goals of the MS4
permit and/or the State of Tennessee Construction General Permit
(CGP).
(b) The city reserves the right to accept or reject BMPs and
engineering methods and calculations not explicitly detailed within the
adopted BMP manuals.
(c) The city manual(s) may be updated and expanded from time
to time, at the discretion of the governing body of the city, upon the
recommendation of the City of Columbia Department of Development
Services, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and
local maintenance experience, or changes in federal or state law or
regulation. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and
maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be presumed to
meet the minimum water quality performance standards. (1968 Code,
§ 4-601, as replaced by Ord. #3735, Dec. 2007, Ord. #3941, March 2013,
Ord. #4007, Feb. 2015, Ord. #4032, Sept. 2015, and Ord. #4059, May
2016)
14-402. Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply: Words used in the singular shall include the plural, and
the plural shall include the singular; words used in the present tense shall
include the future tense. The word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary.
The word "may" is permissive. Words not defined in this section shall be
construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in
the latest edition of Webster's Dictionary.
(1) "Administrative or civil penalties." Under the authority provided
in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-221-1106, the city declares that any person
violating the provisions of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the
city of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
(2) "As-built plans" means drawings depicting conditions as they were
actually constructed.
(3) "Best Management Practices" ("BMPs") means schedules of
activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other
Change 7, June 14, 2018 14-8
management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to waters
of the state. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures,
and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste
disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.
(4) "Borrow pit" is an excavation from which erodible material
(typically soil) is removed to be fill for another site. There is no processing or
separation of erodible material conducted at the site. Given the nature of
activity and pollutants present at such excavation, a borrow pit is considered a
construction activity for the purpose of this permit.
(5) "Buffer zone" means a setback from the top of water body's bank
of undisturbed vegetation, including trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation;
enhanced or restored vegetation; or the re-establishment of native vegetation
bordering streams, ponds, wetlands, springs, reservoirs or lakes, which exists
or is established to protect those water bodies. The goal of the water quality
buffer is to preserve undisturbed vegetation that is native to the streamside
habitat in the area of the project. Vegetated, preferably native, water quality
buffers protect water bodies by providing structural integrity and canopy cover,
as well as stormwater infiltration, filtration and evapotranspiration. For buffer
zone requirements see title 14, chapter 5, of the municipal code.
(6) "Channel" means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite
bed and banks that conducts flowing water continuously or periodically.
(7) "Common plan of development or sale" is broadly defined as any
announcement or documentation (including a sign, public notice or hearing,
sales pitch, advertisement, drawing, permit application, zoning request,
computer design, etc.) or physical demarcation (including boundary signs, lot
stakes, surveyor markings, etc.) indicating construction activities may occur on
a specific plot. A common plan of development or sale identifies a situation in
which multiple areas of disturbance are occurring on contiguous areas. This
applies because the activities may take place at different times, on different
schedules, by different operators.
(8) "Design storm event" means a hypothetical storm event, of a given
frequency interval and duration, used in the analysis and design of a
stormwater facility. The estimated design rainfall amounts, for any return
period interval in terms of either twenty-four (24) hour depths or intensities for
any duration, can be found by accessing the following NOAA National Weather
Service Atlas 14 data for the Columbia, Tennessee station ID: 40-1957.
(9) "Contaminant" means any physical, chemical, biological, or
radiological substance or matter in water.
(10) "Development." Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or permanent
storage of materials (as defined as materials oflike nature stored in whole or in
part for more than six (6) months).
Change 7, June 14, 2018 14-9
(11) "Discharge" means dispose, deposit, spill, pour, inject, seep, dump,
leak or place by any means, or that which is disposed, deposited, spilled, poured,
injected, seeped, dumped, leaked, or placed by any means including any direct
or indirect entry of any solid or liquid matter into the municipal separate storm
sewer system.

conjunction with or promoted by human activities or effects.
(14) "Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control (EPSC) plan" means a
written plan including drawings or other graphic representations) that is
designed to minimize the erosion and sediment runoff at a site during
construction activities.
(15) "Hotspot" means an area where land use or activities generate
highly contaminated runoff, with concentrations of pollutants in excess of those
typically found in stormwater. The following land uses and activities are deemed
stormwater hot spots, but that term is not limited to only these land uses.
(16) "Illicit connections" means illegal and/or unauthorized connections
to the municipal separate storm sewer system whether or not such connections
result in discharges into that system.
(17) "Illicit discharge" means any discharge to the municipal separate
storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater and not
specifically exempted under §14-407(2).
(18) "Improved sinkhole" is a natural surface depression that has been
altered in order to direct fluids into the hole opening. Improved sinkhole is a
type of injection well regulated under TDEC's Underground Injection Control
(UIC) program. Underground injection constitutes an intentional disposal of
waste waters in natural depressions, open fractures, and crevices (such as those
commonly associated with weathering of limestone).
(19) "Inspector." An inspector is a person that has successfully
completed (has a valid certification from) the "Fundamentals of Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control Level I" course or equivalent course. An
inspector performs and documents the required inspections, paying particular
attention to time-sensitive permit requirements such as stabilization and
maintenance activities. An inspector may also have the following
responsibilities:
(a) Oversee the requirements of other construction-related
permits, such as Aquatic Resources Alteration Permit (ARAP) or Corps
of Engineers permit for construction activities in or around waters of the
state;
(b) Update field SWPPPs;
Change 7, June 14, 2018 14-10
(c) Conduct pre-construction inspection to verify that
undisturbed areas have been properly marked and initial measures have
been installed; and
(d) Inform the permit holder of activities that may be necessary
to gain or remain in compliance with the Construction General Permit
(CGP) and other environmental permits.
(20) "Land disturbing activity" means any activity on property that
results in a change in the existing soil cover (both vegetative and
non-vegetative) and/or the existing soil topography. Land-disturbing activities
include, but are not limited to, development, re-development, demolition,
construction, reconstruction, clearing, grading, filling, and excavation.
(21) "Maintenance" means any activity that is necessary to keep a
stormwater facility in good working order so as to function as designed.
Maintenance shall include complete reconstruction of a stormwater facility if
reconstruction is needed in order to restore the facility to its original operational
design parameters. Maintenance shall also include the correction of any problem
on the site property that may directly impair the functions of the stormwater
facility.
(22) "Maintenance agreement" means a document recorded in the land
records that acts as a property deed restriction, and which provides for
long-term maintenance of storm water management practices.
(23) "Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)" means the
conveyances owned or operated by the city for the collection and transportation
of stormwater, including the roads and streets and their drainage systems, catch
basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, and storm drains, and

violation, including a reference to the provision within this chapter that has
been violated. In addition, the notice shall set a reasonable time for the
abatement and correction of the violation.
(3) If it is determined that the violation or violations continue after the
time fixed for abatement and correction has expired, the city engineer shall
issue a citation by certified mail to the person who is in violation. Each such
notice shall be in writing and shall describe the nature of the violation,
including a reference to the provision within this chapter that has been violated
and what penalty, if any, is proposed to be assessed. The person charged has
fifteen (15) days within which to contest the citation or proposed assessment of
penalty and to file a request for a hearing with the city engineer or his/her
designee. At the conclusion of this hearing, the city engineer or his/her designee
will issue a final order, subject to appeal to the appropriate authority. If, within
fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the citation issued by the city engineer, the
person fails to contest the citation or proposed assessment of penalty, the
citation or proposed assessment of penalty shall be deemed the final order of the
director.
Change 6, October 8, 2015 14-42
(4) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be
liable for any cost or expenses incurred as a result thereof by the City of
Columbia.
(5) Penalties that may be assessed for those deemed to be in violation
may include the following:
(a) A civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each violation. Every day that such violation(s) continue

conformance with previously issued requirements.
(3) Waivers for development may also be granted in two additional
forms, if deemed appropriate by the city engineer:
(a) The buffer width may be reduced at some points as long as
the average width of the buffer meets the minimum requirement. This
averaging of the buffer may be used to allow for the presence of an
existing structure or to recover a lost lot, as long as the streamside zone
(Zone I) is not disturbed by the reduction and no new structures are built
within the 100-year floodplain.
(b) The City of Columbia Department of Development Services
may offer credit for additional density elsewhere on the site in
compensation for the loss of developable land due to the requirements of
this chapter. This compensation may increase the total number of
dwelling units on the site up to the amount permitted under the base
zoning.
(4) The applicant shall submit a written request for a variance to the
director of the department of development services. The application shall include
specific reasons justifying the variance and any other information necessary to
evaluate the proposed variance request. The City of Columbia Department of
Development Services may require an alternative analysis that c1early
demonstrates that no other feasible alternatives exist and that minimal impact
will occur as a result of the project or development.
(5) In granting a request for a variance, the city engineer may require
site design, landscape planting, fencing, signs, and water quality best
management practices to reduce adverse impacts on water quality, streams,
wetlands, and floodplains. (as added by Ord. #3736 (amended), Dec. 2007, and
replaced by Ord. #3942, March 2013)
14-509. Conflict with other regulations. Where the standards and
management requirements of this buffer chapter are in conflict with other laws,
regulations, and policies regarding streams, steep slopes, erodible soils,
wetlands, floodplains, timber harvesting, land disturbance activities, or other
environmental protective measures, the more restrictive shall apply. (as added
by Ord. #3736 (amended), Dec. 2007, and replaced by Ord. #3942, March 2013)

(a) In the event the city does any installation work not covered
in the table of installation charges, the cost of such work shall be charged
to the customer according to a schedule of rates established by the
wastewater department. The installation charge is to be paid at the time
the sewer permit is issued.
(b) The wastewater department may allow or instruct the
applicant for a permit to install the required tap in lieu of tap installation
fees. This decision is entirely at the discretion of the wastewater
department. The charge for identifying the tap location will remain
applicable on all permits.
(c) Multiple structures located within one parcel of property
that will utilize existing service lines or construct new service lines as a
means to connect to public sewer, are subject to the applicable tap
installation charge. (examples: mobile home parks, guest houses,
apartment, etc.)
(3) A sewer infrastructure construction charge of three thousand six
hundred dollars ($3,600.00) per benefited property is hereby enacted for the
extension of new sewer services.
Change 6, October 8, 2015 18-3
(a) All infrastructure construction charges are due and payable
at the time of issuance of a sewer permit; however in the event the city
is extending its sanitary sewer infrastructure, to the property in question,
the property owner may notify the city in writing that he elects to pay
said sewer infrastructure construction charge in five (5) annual
installments as herein provided. If the property owner elects to pay said
charge in annual installments, said infrastructure construction charge
amount shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on
the unpaid balance. A property owner desiring to exercise the privilege
of payment by installment shall, before the issuance of the sewer permit,
enter into an agreement in writing with said city. Such agreement shall
provide that in consideration of such privilege the property owner will
pay the same as agreed with the specified interest and all costs of
collection, including a reasonable attorney's fee upon default as
hereinafter provided. Said agreement is to be filed in the office of the city
recorder, or person designated, and in all cases where such agreement
has not been signed and filed, the charges shall be paid in full before the
issuance of the sewer permit. Any property owner who elects in writing
to pay the sewer infrastructure construction charge in five (5)
installments shall have the right and privilege of paying the charge in full
at any installment period by paying the full amount of the installments,
together with all accrued interest. If any property owner defaults in the
payment of any installment and interest thereon, all of said installments,
with interest, shall become immediately due and payable.
(b) Whenever any installment payment of the sewer
infrastructure construction charge becomes past due for a period of sixty
(60) days, the city recorder shall certify said delinquent installments to
the city attorney, who shall proceed to enforce the collection of said
charge, plus accrued interest and costs of collection hereinabove set forth.
(4) If any person issued a permit to connect to the sanitary sewer
system of the city fails to make the sewer connection within ninety (90) days
after the date of issuance of such permit, and in the meantime, any charge
prescribed by this section is increased, then such permit is void and of no further
force and effect. To have the permit reinstated, the person must pay the
difference between the previously paid charge and the newly enacted charge.
(5) Written requests for refunds of sewer connection or tap installation
charges shall be made within ninety (90) days of the date of the sewer permit.
Tap installation charges are non-refundable if tap installation has commenced
or the location of the tap has been provided prior to the receipt of the request for
refund. All refunds associated with the connection and/or tap installation
charges are subject to a five percent (5%) processing charge. After such refund,
the sewer permit is void and of no further force and effect.
(6) The obligation to pay the sewer connection and/or tap installation
charge established in this section is in addition to, and does not replace, any
Change 6, October 8, 2015 18-4
responsibility to construct or extend collector lines as required under the
Columbia Municipal Code and/or the City of Columbia Subdivision Regulations.
The obligation to pay the sewer infrastructure construction charge is in addition
to, and does not replace, any responsibility for payment of sewer connection or
tap installation charges as required under the Columbia Municipal Code.

Seven dollars and forty-two cents ($7.42) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
of the water volume charge shall be designated for the pretreatment program.
A service unit shall be determined as the number of electrical meter boxes
installed on the property of any person, corporation, firm or others that are
users of the City of Columbia sewer system. One (1) user charge shall be paid
for each electrical meter installed on a user's property.
(3) Sewer charges for all customers other than residential shall be
based on the actual volume equal to the metered water consumption for said
period.
(4) Said rates shall be billed simultaneously with rates for water
service, shall be subject to the same penalties for delayed payment as are
imposed in the case of water bills, and shall be paid and collected in the same
manner as water bills. Users will not be permitted to pay the water bill without
simultaneous payment of the sewer bill, and in the event of nonpayment within
thirty (30) days from the date of such bills, water service shall be discontinued
in accordance with state and local regulations.
(5) When a water leak or significant event occurs such that metered
water does not enter the sewer and the volume exceeds two hundred percent
Change 6, October 8, 2015 18-5
(200%) of the maximum monthly volume during the past year or thirty thousand
(30,000) gallons, then the director of wastewater may make an estimate of the
appropriate adjustment at the director's discretion. No adjustment shall be
made for a charge over six (6) months old nor may the director adjust for more
than two (2) charges for any one (1) occurrence. Upon request, the customer
shall provide any necessary documentation supporting the request for an
adjustment.
(6) Special contracts may be negotiated with any user who discharges
into the system sewage of such characteristics as to require additional treatment
above that required for ordinary sewage. Said contracts shall contain such rates
and charges as shall compensate the city for the additional costs involved. (1968
Code, § 13-203, as amended by Ord. #1881, June 1992, and Ord. #1945, June

18-104. Sewers outside the corporate city limits. The City of
Columbia reserves the right to restrict any and all connections, extensions or
additions to the sanitary sewer lines which are within or without the corporate
city limits. Sewer lines within the corporate city limits shall be subjected to the
regulation of the planning and zoning commission, building inspection and other
regulatory review by the city. Where a property owner desires to connect to the
sewer lines outside the corporate city limits, it shall be done after approval of
the Council of the City of Columbia following a petition by the property owner
for annexation to the City of Columbia. The city council may institute
annexation proceedings or in the council's choice, may allow connection to the
sewer without annexation of the property. In any case, authorization to connect
to the sewer shall be allowed only in such circumstances that the council is
assured that the standard of construction, not only of sewer lines, but also of the
entire development, shall be of a standard and quality which will provide the
residents of the city with no obligations greater than similar developments as
constructed within the city limits. (1968 Code, § 13-204)

18-207. Sewer use requirements--general provisions. (1) Purpose
and policy. (a) The purpose of this chapter is to set uniform requirements
for users of the city's wastewater collection system and treatment works
to enable the city to comply with the provisions of the Clean Water Act
and other applicable federal and state law and regulations, and to provide
for the public health and welfare by regulating the quality of wastewater
discharged into the city's wastewater collection system and treatment
works.
(b) This article provides a means for determining wastewater
volumes, constituents and characteristics, the setting of charges and fees,
and the issuance of permits to certain users. This chapter establishes
effluent limitations and other discharge criteria and provides that certain
users shall pretreat waste to prevent the introduction of pollutants into
the publicly owned treatment works (hereinafter referred to as POTW)
which will interfere with the operation of the POTW, may cause
environmental damage, interfere with the use or disposal of sewage
sludge; and to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW
which may pass through the treatment works into the receiving waters
or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the treatment
works; to enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly
owned treatment works is subject; and to improve the opportunities to
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-9
recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludge resulting from wastewater
treatment. This chapter provides measures for the enforcement of its
provisions and abatement of violations thereof. This chapter establishes
a wastewater appeals board and establishes its duties and establishes the
duties of the director of the department of wastewater to ensure that the
provisions of this chapter are administered fairly and equitably to all
users. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
individual wastewater discharge permits, or in general permits, more
stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW
consistent with the purpose of this ordinance.

18-210. Applications for service--permits--penalties. (1) Domestic
use and commercial use. A formal application for either original or additional
service must be made at the office of the director and be duly approved before
connection is made. The receipt by the city of a prospective customer's
application for service shall not obligate the city to render the service. If the
service applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with this chapter and the
city's rules and regulations and general practice, the connection charge will be
refunded in full, and there shall be no liability of the city to the applicant for
such service, except that conditional waivers for additional services may be
granted by the director for interim periods if compliance may be assured within
a reasonable period of time.
(a) Domestic use. Domestic use shall be defined as residential
use and no use (discharge) permit shall be required.
(b) Commercial use. Commercial use shall be defined as any
nonresidential use. All potential commercial users shall obtain a
nonresidential survey upon application for building permit or sewer
connection permit and shall complete it prior to issuance of a certificate
of occupancy or final approval of connection to a sewer tap. The director
shall review the non-residential survey and determine whether a user or
discharge permit shall be required. Commercial users may be required to
install grease traps, grease interceptors, catch basins, screening devices,
oil/water separators or other facilities to prevent the entry of harmful
materials or substances into the public sewer. Such installation will be
at the user's expense and shall be installed upon notification from the
director. Cleanout and upkeep of such facilities will be at the user's
expense and shall be done in such a manner to prevent the undesirable
material or substance from entering the public sewer system. Records of
cleanout and maintenance of such interceptors shall be kept available for
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-25
inspection by the city for a period of three (3) years and shall be
submitted to the director or his designee upon written notification.
(2) Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) control program. Disposal of "oil" by
discharge to the sewer system is not permitted. Oils include automotive
lubricating oils, transmission and brake fluid, other Industrial oils and Fats,
Oils And Grease (FOG) used in or resulting from a Food Service Establishment
(FSE) or food processing facility. The purpose of a FOG control program is to
significantly limit fats, oils and greases from entering the Wastewater Collection
and Transmission System (WCTS), in order to reduce Sanitary Sewer Overflows
(SSOs) related to blockages caused by FOG.
(a) Discharge of FOG. No user shall contribute or cause to be
contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will
interfere with the operation and performance of the POTW (sanitary
sewer system of the City of Columbia, Tennessee). Prohibited discharges
include, any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or oil, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l or containing
substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperature between
thirty-two or one hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (32 or 150° F) or zero
to sixty five degrees Celsius (0 to 65° C).
(b) Interference with the sanitary sewer system operations. Any
user who discharges animal and vegetable fat, oil, and grease in the
volume or form which interferes with the operation of the sanitary sewer
system may be subject to enforcement actions as specified and may be
billed for cleanup charges incurred by the Columbia Wastewater System
when that user's discharge causes operation and maintenance problems
in the sanitary sewer system such as blockages, backups, overflows,
interruption of service, excessive FOG accumulation in lift stations and
pipes, and other FOG related problems that are tracked to that user's
discharge.
(c) Control of FOG.
(i) All existing and new FSEs shall effectively control the
discharge of FOG into the sanitary sewer system. A Class 1 FSE
may do this through the use of best management practices such as
those published on the City of Columbia, Tennessee website. See:
http://www.columbiatn.com/FOG. If best management practices
fail to prevent sanitary sewer system interferences Class 1 FSEs
shall install a Grease Removal Device (GRD) as specified by the
director or FOG control program coordinator.
(ii) All new Class 2-5 FSEs shall install grease removal
equipment in sizes specified in this section and properly maintain
that equipment in such a way to prevent interference with the
sanitary sewer system.
(iii) Existing FSEs changing ownership, undergoing
renovations or changes in plumbing, kitchen equipment, seating
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-26
capacity, or menu items shall install grease removal equipment in
sizes specified in this section and properly maintain that
equipment in such a way to prevent interference with the sanitary
sewer system.
(iv) All FSEs with a GRD shall maintain records of
cleaning and maintenance of that equipment. Records include at
a minimum the date of cleaning or maintenance, company or
person conducting the cleaning or maintenance, and the amount
of grease and water removed from the equipment. A grease waste
hauler completed manifest will meet this requirement. Records are
to be kept on site and shall be submitted for review in accordance
to the FOG control program.
(v) Yellow grease such as fryer oil, shall not be
discharged into the GRD or into stormwater conveyances. The use
of yellow grease recycling containers is encouraged.
(vi) Owners of commercial property will be held
responsible for wastewater discharges from FSE leaseholders on
their property.
(vii) All FSEs shall provide access to Columbia wastewater
personnel (after proper identification) for the purpose of inspection
of a GRD, kitchen equipment and practices, and any cleaning and
drain remediation products which relate to the wastewater and
FOG discharge.
(d) Grease Removal Device (GRD) to control grease. (i)
Minimum acceptable size of a GRD is as follows. Larger sizes may
be required by the director or his designee.
(A) Class 1: 20 gpm/40 lbs. grease trap.
(B) Class 2: 1,000 gallon grease interceptor.
(C) Class 3: 1,000 gallon grease interceptor.
(D) Class 4: 1,500 gallon grease interceptor.
(E) Class 5: 2,000 gallon grease interceptor.
(ii) Any FSE either new or existing that is found to be
interfering with the sanitary sewer system may be asked to install
a GRD that is larger than the minimum size and take other steps
to stop that interference.
(iii) Existing FSEs that do not meet these minimum sizes
may continue to use an existing GRD and/or best management
practices if the discharge from the FSE is not interfering with the
sanitary sewer system and the FSEs annual permit states the
current GRD and/or practices are preventing interference with the
sanitary sewer system. Upon written notice from the director or
designee stating the existing GRD or BMPs are inadequate to
protect the sanitary sewer system from interference, the FSE shall
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-27
have thirty (30) days to install a GRD to prevent FOG interference
with the sanitary sewer system.
(iv) High temperature waste shall not be discharged to
the GRD unless an FSEs annual permit obtains a written waiver.
Additionally, such FSEs shall be required to install larger GRD(s)
to allow for cooling of the discharge and thereby prevent discharge
of FOG into the sanitary sewer system. Waivers shall be revoked
for inadequate systems that cause interference. Written notice will
be provided and the FSE shall submit a revised grease control plan
that includes routing high temperature discharges away from the
GRD.
(v) Grease traps. These small, under-the-counter units
shall be installed according to manufacturer's specifications.
Dishwashing machines and other high temperature waters shall
not be discharged into these units. Failure to follow this
requirement will render the trap ineffective and the FSE shall be
instructed to install a large external grease interceptor.

larger PVC Schedule 40 or stronger.
(A) Influent and effluent pipes shall be equipped
with Tee fittings properly positioned as follows. Influent
flow shall be directed downward and the Tee shall
terminate twenty four inches (24") below the water surface.
Effluent Tee shall block all surface grease and terminate
eight to twelve inches (8" - 12") above the bottom of the unit.
(B) The tank shall be constructed to have two (2)
compartments. Two thirds (2/3) of the volume shall be in the
influent side and one third (1/3) on the effluent side. A solid
baffle wall shall extend from the bottom to within six inches
(6") of the top and shall be equipped with a six inch (6")
elbow installed in the baffle wall with drawing flow from the
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-28
influent side of the unit at a depth of twelve inches (12")
from the bottom.
(C) Manhole covers shall be of materials and
strength to withstand expected surface loads, and secured
to prevent accidental entry.
(D) Interceptors shall be located for effective
cleaning and not blocked by structures or landscaping.
(E) Interceptor sizes greater than two thousand
(2,000) gallons shall be served by two (2) or more tanks
installed in series.
(f) Maintenance of the GRD. (i) Owners/users are responsible

pretreatment facilities for existing sources are required under the
provisions of this chapter, the users shall submit written progress reports
to the director as required by the director under the schedule or
compliance order, based on the complexity of the pretreatment
requirement. The following conditions and reporting requirements shall
apply to the compliance schedule:
(i) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in
the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events (e.g., acquiring required authorities, developing funding
mechanisms, acquiring equipment);
(ii) No increment referred to in subparagraph (b)(i) shall
exceed nine (9) months;
(iii) No later than fourteen (14) days following each date
in the schedule and the final date for compliance, a progress report
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-35
shall be submitted to the director. At minimum, the progress
report shall include whether or not the user complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date
on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the
reason for delay, and the steps taken to return to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such progress reports to the director.
(c) Inspection of facilities. A permit for the operation of a new
or existing pretreatment or equalization system shall not become effective
until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the director and
written approval for operation is issued to the owner by the director. The
director or his representative shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
state of construction, and in any event, the applicant for the permit shall
notify the director when the work is ready for final inspection. In
addition, the director shall be allowed to make periodic inspections of the
facilities in operation as he deems necessary.
The director may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are
being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater
is created or discharged shall allow the director or his representatives
ready access at all reasonable times to parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection or sampling or in the performance of any of their
duties. The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering
operations.
(d) Maintenance of facilities. It shall be the responsibility of the
owner to maintain all wastewater treatment or equalization facilities in
good working order at all times. The director must be notified in writing
when pretreatment facilities will not be or are not operative by reason of
equipment malfunction, emergency or routine maintenance, or any
reason whatsoever. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to repair
and maintain all pretreatment facilities on a high priority basis.

18-212. Monitoring, reports, access, and safety. (1) Monitoring
facilities. All industrial users for whom a discharge permit is issued must
install a special sampling facility to be built in accordance with City of Columbia
specifications. Users in areas designated for industrial development (industrial
parks and any zoned industrial area) must also install such a sampling manhole
whether or not a discharge permit is issued.
When, in the judgment of the director, there is a significant difference in
wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-36
a single user the director may require that separate monitoring facilities be
installed for each separate source of discharge.
Permanent monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be
constructed and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is
to enable inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced
by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the director, it
shall be provided and installed at the user's expense. Wastewater samples will
be made available to the industry if requested. However, the industry is
responsible for providing its own adequate sample containers.
The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The director may, however, when such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with the approval of
the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be
accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for city personnel, and to
secure the city's monitoring equipment.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the director's requirements and
all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications. When, in
the judgment of the director, an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the
user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be completed as required
by the director following written notification unless an extension is granted by
the director.
Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of
categorical pretreatment standard-baseline report. Within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one
hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a
category determination submission under Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(1)(d),
whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical
pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to a WWF shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which
contains the information listed in subparagraphs (a)-(g) of this paragraph. At
least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and
sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control
authority a report which contains the information listed in subparagraphs (a)-(e)
of this paragraph. New sources shall also be required to include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the
information requested in subparagraphs (d) and (e) of this paragraph:
(a) Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and
address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-37
(b) Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.
(c) Description of operations. The User shall submit a brief
description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard
industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial
user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which
indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the regulated processes.
(d) Flow measurement. The user shall submit information
showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons
per day, to the WWF from each of the following:
(i) Regulated process streams; and
(ii) Other wastestreams as necessary to allow use of the
combined wastestream formula of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-.06(5)
(see part (e)(iv) of this paragraph). The control authority may allow
for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or
feasibility considerations.
(e) Measurement of pollutants. (i) The user shall identify the
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.
(ii) In addition, the user shall submit the results of
sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or
mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where
required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of
daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance
with a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by
the control authority or the applicable standards to determine
compliance with the standard.
(iii) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply
with the requirements of this paragraph.
(iv) Samples should be taken immediately downstream
from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists.
If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater
prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-.06(5) in order to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
Tennessee Rule 0400-40-.06(5) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-38
(v) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and
amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or
where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the WWF
or other parties, approved by the administrator.
(vi) The control authority may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for
industrial pretreatment measures.
(vii) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and
place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles
and expected pollutant discharges to the WWF.
(f) Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user (as defined in paragraph (12) of this
rule) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements; and
(g) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest
schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not
be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard.
(i) Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment
standard has been modified by a removal allowance (Tennessee
Rule 0400-40-14-.07), the combined wastestream formula
(paragraph (5) of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06), and/or a
fundamentally different factors variance (Tennessee Rule
0400-40-14-.13) at the time the user submits the report required
by paragraph (2) of this rule, the information required by
subparagraphs (f) and (g) of this paragraph shall pertain to the
modified limits.
(ii) If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified
by a removal allowance (Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.07), the
combined wastestream formula (paragraph (5) of Tennessee Rule
0400-40-14-.06), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-39
(Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.13) after the user submits the report
required by paragraph (2) of this rule, any necessary amendments
to the information requested by subparagraphs (f) and (g) of this
paragraph shall be submitted by the user to the city within sixty
(60) days after the modified limit is approved.
(2) Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in
subparagraphs (1)(d)-(f) of this rule. For industrial users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance
with the procedures in Tennessee Rule 0400-40-.06(3), this report shall contain
a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period.
The city shall require frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols,
oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty-four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city. The samples
must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and
grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for
other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate.
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize
a lower minimum. The city shall require the number of grab samples necessary
to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-40
(3) Reports. All Significant Industrial Users (SIU) and categorical
industrial users are required to submit periodic self-monitoring reports under
40 CFR 403-12(e) and other sections. These requirements include, but are not
limited to, the following:
(a) SIUs shall submit to the POTW, at least twice a year,
reports which, at a minimum, describe the nature, concentration, and
flow of pollutants which are limited by the POTW (403.12(e) and (h)). In
cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall
submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user;
(b) If sampling performed by an SIU indicates a violation, or
any measurement of any concentration or mass limit or flow or other
parameter specified in the permit is exceeded, the SIU shall notify the
POTW within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation
or excessive discharge. The SIU shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis then submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation
(403-12(g)(2)). Where the city has performed the sampling and analysis
in lieu of the industrial user, the city must perform the repeat sampling
and analysis.
(c) An SIU that monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the permit or other regulation shall include the results of the
extra monitoring in the report (403.12(g)(5)).
(d) The self-monitoring reports shall include the following
certification statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who managed the
system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware
that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of penalty and imprisonment
for knowing violations (403.12(1) and 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
(e) The self-monitoring reports shall be signed as follows:
(i) If the SIU is a corporation, the responsible corporate
officer is a president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president in
charge of the principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy- or decision-making functions or the
manager at one (1) or more manufacturing, production, or
operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-41
management decisions which govern the operation of the regulated
facility including having the explicit or implicit duty of making
major capital investment recommendations, and initiate and direct
other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental
compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure
that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to
gather complete and accurate information for control mechanism
requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been
assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate
procedures.
(ii) By a general partner or proprietor if the SIU is a
partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively.
(iii) By a duly authorized representative of the individual in
(i) or (ii) above if:
(A) The authorization is made in writing;
(B) The authorization specifies either an individual
or a position having responsibility for the overall operation
of the facility and
(C) The written authorization is submitted to the
POTW (403.12(1)).
(f) Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the
WWF, shall submit to the control authority during the months of June
and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment
standard or by the city or the approval authority, a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited
by such categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall
include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in subparagraph
(2)(d) of this rule except that the city may require more detailed reporting
of flows. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a best management practice (or pollution prevention alternative),
the user shall submit documentation required by the city or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the user. At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.
The director may impose mass limitations on industrial users
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations
is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by the above paragraph
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-42
shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards
in the effluent of the industrial user.
The reports required in this section shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration of production and mass limits where requested by the
director of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be
one twenty-four (24) hour monitoring period per one to three (1-3) million
gallons of discharge until under the director's discretion sufficient results
have shown consistent compliance with permit limitations. The frequency
for a particular industry shall be indicated on its industrial discharge
permit.
All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Environmental Protection Agency under the provision
of part 136 section 304 (h) of the Act [33 U.S.C. 1314 (h)] and contained
in 40 C.F.R. and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures
approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. The report shall have
the signature of an authorized representative that certifies the validity
of the report.
(4) Maintenance of records. Any industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section.
Such records shall include for all samples:
(a) The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the persons taking the samples;
(b) The dates analyses were performed;
(c) Who performed the analyses;
(d) The analytical techniques/methods used; and
(e) The results of such analyses.
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this
section (including documentation associated with best management practices)
shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years any records of
monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are
required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection
and copying by the director, approval authority, or the Environmental
Protection Agency. This period of retention shall be extended during the course
of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or WWF when
requested by the director, TDEC or EPA.
(5) Entry on private property. The director and other duly authorized
employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The director or his representatives shall have authority to inquire into
any processes including metallurgical, chemical, oil refining, ceramic, paper, or
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-43
other industries having a direct bearing on the kind and sources of discharge to
the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste treatment. Such information
should be requested to be confidential under §18-210 (3)(b).
(6) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private
properties, the director or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all
safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the
company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the
city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city
employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the
monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence
or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(7) Easement. The director and other duly authorized employees of the
city and personnel of the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted
to enter all private properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated
easement for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,
repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said
easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be
done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. #3352, March 2000, as
replaced by Ord. #3932, Dec. 2012, and Ord. #4153, Sept. 2017)
18-213. Discharge regulations. (1) Applicability. National
pretreatment standards specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or
pollutant properties which may be discharged to a WWF by existing or new
industrial users in specific industrial subcategories are established as separate
regulations under the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N.
These standards, unless specifically noted otherwise, shall be in addition to all
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in Tennessee
Rule 0400-40-14-.06. All users of the facilities of the POTW shall comply with
the following regulations and restrictions before discharging or causing to be
discharged any wastewater to the public sewer system. All measurements, tests,
and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is
made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR part 136
or equivalent methods approved by the EPA
(2) Wastewater pollutants - maximum concentrations. No person or
user shall discharge wastewater in excess of the pollutant concentrations
identified in the Operational Division Policy 2016-011 or subsequent revisions
thereto unless:
1The Operational Division Policy 2016-01, along with Tables A-D, and any
amendments thereto may be found in the recorder's office.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-44
(a) An exception has been granted the user under the provisions
of § 18-213; or
(b) The wastewater discharge permit of the user provides, as a
special permit condition, a higher interim concentration level in conjunction
with a requirement that the user construct a pretreatment facility or institute
changes in operation and maintenance procedures to reduce the concentration
of pollutants to levels not exceeding the standards set forth in the table within
a fixed period of time.
Local limits: The director is authorized to establish local limits pursuant
to Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.05 (3).
Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements shall be considered in violation of this chapter. The WWF may
develop best management practices (BMPs) by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits and general permits to implement local limits and
the requirements of §18-213.
(3) Prohibited pollutants and prohibited wastewater discharges. In
accordance with Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.05(2), the following pollutants shall
not be introduced into the WWF:
(a) Pollutants that create a fire or explosion hazard, including,
but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than
one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140EF) or sixty degrees
Centigrade (60Edegrees C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR
261.21;
(b) Pollutants which cause corrosive structural damage, but in
no case discharges with a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 9.0;
(c) Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which cause
obstruction to the flow of the sewers, or other interference with the
operation of or which cause injury to the WWF, including waxy or other
materials which tend to coat and clog a sewer line or other appurtenances
thereto;
(d) Any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants
(BOD, etc.), released in a discharge of such volume or strength as to cause
interference in the WWF;
(e) Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity
resulting in interference, but in no case heat such quantities that the
temperature of the influent at the treatment works exceeds forty degrees
Centigrade (40E C) (one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104E F).
Unless a higher temperature is allowed in the user's wastewater
discharge permit, no user shall discharge into any sewer line or other
appurtenance wastewater with a temperature exceeding sixty five and
one half degrees Centigrade (65.5E C) (one hundred fifty degrees
Fahrenheit (150E F);
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-45
(f) Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass
through;
(g) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems;
(h) Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed
by the treatment process;
(i) Any trucked or hauled pollutants except at designated
discharge points;
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not
be processed or stored in such a manner that could result in a discharge to the
WWF.
The foresaid pollutants represent a general description of harmful or
dangerous conditions and are in addition to such specific pollutants as may be
identified and added from time to time to the table(s) referenced in § 18-213,
the industrial user's permits and any discharge permit.
No person or user shall introduce or cause to be introduced any pollutant
or wastewater which causes obstruction to the flow of the sewers, pass through
or interference. Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, pool drainage, condensate, noncontact cooling
water, deionized water, or unpolluted wastewater are prohibited, unless
specifically authorized by the director. Prohibitions apply to all persons and
users whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or
any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(4) Protection of treatment plant influent. No person or user shall
discharge wastewater that will cause the influent concentration at the POTW
to exceed the pollutant levels identified in Operational Division Policy 2016-01
or subsequent revisions thereto. The director shall monitor the treatment works
influent for each pollutant identified in the Operational Division Policy 2016-01
or subsequent revisions thereto. In the event that the influent at the treatment
works reaches or exceeds the levels established by said table, the director shall
initiate technical studies to determine the cause of the influent violation and
shall initiate such remedial measures as are necessary, including but not limited
to the establishment of new or revised pretreatment levels for these parameters.
The director may also change any of these criteria in the event the POTW
effluent standards are changed or in the event changes are deemed advisable for
effective operation of the POTW.
(5) Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the director from
establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria more restrictive where
wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the POTW
or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge of the POTW to violate
effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with the use or handling of
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-46
sludge, or to pass through the POTW resulting in a violation of the NPDES
permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for discharge to
municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may be imposed by
the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and/or the United
States Environmental Protection Agency.
(6) Special agreements. Nothing in this section shall be construed so
as to prevent any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
user of the wastewater treatment system whereby wastewater of unusual
strength or character is accepted into the system and specially treated subject
to any payments· or user charges as may be applicable. The making of such
special agreements or arrangements between the city and the user shall be
strictly limited to the capability of the POTW to handle such wastes without
interfering with unit operations or sludge use and handling or allowing the pass
through of pollutants which would result in a violation of the NPDES permit or
violation of any federal or state pretreatment requirement.
(7) Limitations on wastewater strength. It is the intent of this chapter
to regulate all discharges of compatible wastes in excess of normal domestic
wastewater.
(8) Exceptions to discharge criteria. (a) Application for exception.
Non-residential users of the POTW may apply for a temporary exception
to the prohibited and restricted wastewater discharge criteria listed in
§ 18-213(2) of this chapter. Exceptions can be granted according to the
following guidelines.
The director shall allow applications for temporary exceptions at
any time. However, the director shall not accept an application if the
applicant has submitted the same or substantially similar application
within the preceding year and the same has been denied by the director.
All applications for an exception shall be in writing, and shall
contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of the factors to be
considered by the city in its review of the application.
(b) Conditions. All exceptions granted under this paragraph
shall be temporary and subject to revocation at any time by the director
upon reasonable notice.
The user requesting the exception must demonstrate to the
director that he is making a concentrated and serious effort to maintain
high standards of operation control and housekeeping levels, etc. so that
discharges to the POTW are being minimized. If negligence is found,
permits will be subject to termination. The user requesting the exception
must demonstrate that compliance with stated concentration and
quantity standards is technically or economically infeasible and
discharge, if exempted, will not:
(i) Interfere with the normal collection and operation of
the wastewater treatment system.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-47
(ii) Limit the sludge management alternatives available
and increase the cost of providing adequate sludge management.
(iii) Pass through the POTW in quantities and/or
concentrations that would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit.
The user must show that the exception, if granted, will not cause
the discharger to violate its in-force federal pretreatment standards
unless the exception is granted under the provisions of the applicable
pretreatment regulations.
A surcharge shall be applied to any exception granted under this
subsection. These surcharges shall be applied for that concentration of
the pollutant for which the variance has been granted in excess of the
concentration stipulated in this chapter based on the average daily flow
of the user.
At such time that the levels of pollutants must be reduced because
of violations of any of the provisions of this section, the following method
shall be used to reduce the discharge levels: All users shall be required
to reduce their discharge levels by a sufficient amount to meet the
standard being violated.
(c) Review of application by the director. All applications for an
exception shall be reviewed by the director. If the application does not
contain sufficient information for complete evaluation, the director shall
notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional
information. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days following
notification by the director to correct such deficiencies. This thirty (30)
day period may be extended by the director upon application and for just
cause shown. Upon receipt of a complete application the director shall
evaluate and act upon same within thirty (30) days.
(d) Criteria for review of application by director. The director
shall review and evaluate all applications for exceptions and shall take
into account the following factors:
(i) Whether or not the applicant is subject to a national
pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more
stringent than those in § 18-213 and grant an exception only if
such exception may be granted within limitations of applicable
federal regulations;
(ii) Whether or not the exception would apply to
discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substance under
regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency
under the provisions of section 307(a) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1317),
and then grant an exception only if such exception may be granted
with the limitations of applicable federal regulations;
(iii) Whether or not the granting of an exception would
create conditions that would reduce the effectiveness of the
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-48
treatment works taking into consideration the concentration of
said pollutant in the treatment works' influent and the design
capability of the treatment works;
(iv) The cost of pretreatment or other types of control
techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve
effluent reduction, but prohibitive cost alone shall not be the basis
for granting an exception;
(v) The age of equipment and industrial facilities
involved to the extent that such factors affect the quality or
quantity of wastewater discharge;
(vi) The process employed by the user and process
changes available which would affect the quality or quantity of
wastewater discharge;
(vii) The engineering aspects of various types of
pretreatment or other control techniques available to the user to
improve the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.
(9) Relaxation of discharge criteria. The director shall, to the
maximum extent feasible, recommend a relaxation of criteria established in this
chapter in the event the POTW effluent standards are changed or if the POTW
removals are such that a relaxation will not cause violation of the effluent
standards.
(10) Accidental discharge. (a) Protection from accidental discharge. All
industrial users shall provide such facilities and institute such
procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the
potential for accidental discharge into the POTW of waste regulated by
this chapter from liquid or raw material storage areas, from truck and
rail car loading and unloading areas, from in plant transfer or processing
and materials handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds for
any waste regulated by this chapter. The wastewater discharge permit of
any user who has a history of significant leaks, spills, or other accidental
discharge of waste regulated by this chapter shall be subject on a
case-by-case basis to a special permit condition or requirement for the
construction of facilities or establishment of procedures which will
prevent or minimize the potential for such accidental discharge. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided
and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for
review, and shall be approved by the director before construction of the
facility.
The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-49
(b) Reports of potential problems. In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a
nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the
POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of
the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user.
Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage
to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
ordinance.
(c) Notice to employees. In order that employees of users be
informed of the city's requirements, users shall make available to their
employees copies of this chapter together with such other wastewater
information and notices which may be furnished by the director from time
to time directed toward more effective water pollution control. A notice
shall be furnished and permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
advising employees whom to call in case of an accidental discharge in
violation of this chapter.
(d) Preventive measures. Any direct or indirect connection or
entry point for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or
drainage system shall be eliminated.
(e) Notification of changes affecting potential to slug discharge.
Significant industrial users are required to notify the POTW immediately
of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge.
(f) Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the control authority (and the WWF if the WWF is not
the control authority) in advance of any substantial change in the volume
or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has
submitted initial notification under Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.12(16).
(g) Notification of hazardous discharge. The industrial user
shall notify the WWF, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any
discharge into the WWF of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under Tennessee Rule 0400-12-01.

#4153, Sept. 2017)
18-214. Wastewater charges, fees, and billing. (1) Purpose of
charges and fees. A schedule of charges and fees shall be adopted by the city
which will enable it to comply with the revenue requirements of the Act and its
amendments. Charges and fees shall be determined in a manner consistent with
regulations of the Act and policies of the city to insure that sufficient revenues
are collected to defray the city's cost of operating and maintaining adequate
wastewater collection and treatment systems and to provide sufficient funds for
capital outlay, bond service costs, capital improvements, depreciation, and
equitable industrial cost recovery of EPA administered federal grants.
(2) Classification of users. All users are to be classified by the director
either by assigning each one to a "user classification" category according to the
principal activity conducted on the user's premises, by individual user
analyzation, or by a combination thereof. The purpose of such collective and/or
individual classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges
based on wastewater constituents and characteristics, to provide an effective
means of source control, and to establish a system of charges and fees which will
insure an equitable recovery of the city's cost.
(3) Types of charges and fees. The charges and fees as established in
the city's schedule of charges and fees, may include, but not be limited to:
(a) User classification charges;
(b) Fees for monitoring, maintenance, and analysis;
(c) Fees for permits;
(d) Surcharge fees;
(e) Industrial cost recovery charge;
(f) Discharge permit fees.
(4) Charges and billing. (a) Wastewater service charge. The
wastewater service charge for normal-domestic wastewater is based on
the water discharged to the POTW as measured by the public water
supply meter, or meters, and/or by any supplementary meter, or meters,
necessary to measure the amount of water discharged. The basic
wastewater service charge shall be determined upon the metered flow
and the schedule of charges and fees adopted by the city in title 18,
chapter 1 of the Columbia Municipal Code.
(b) Extra strength surcharge. Users who discharge or cause to
be discharged extra strength wastes to the sewer system in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter with an appropriate permit therefore
will be subject to a surcharge to compensate the POTW for above normal
operating and maintenance expense incurred in treating and disposing
of the discharge with credit for any reduced operating cost as a result of
the constituents or characteristics discharged by the user. The surcharge
for extra strength wastes will be assessed in accordance with the schedule
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-51
of charges and fee calculated by the director. Users who discharge extra
strength wastes without a permit shall be subject to the enforcement
provisions of this chapter.
(c) Industrial cost recovery charge. All nongovernmental users
identified in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, Office
of Management and Budget, as amended and supplemented under
Division A (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing), Division B (Mining),
Division D (Manufacturing), Division E (Transportation,
Communications, Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services), and Division I
(Services), which discharge to the sanitary sewers wastes other than
domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary conveniences shall be assessed
an industrial cost recovery charge as required in title 40, part 35 of the
U.S. EPA Regulations, based on a schedule of charges and fees adopted
by the city.
The ICR charge will not be assessed until required by applicable
federal regulations.
(d) Billing. The billing for normal domestic wastewater shall
consist of a minimum wastewater service charge with rates as specified
by the city, subject to net and gross rates. Wastewater discharges with
above normal strength characteristics will be subject to an extra strength
surcharge in addition to the wastewater service charge. This surcharge
shall be based on a surcharge schedule which will be formulated by the
director.
(i) Minimum charges. The minimum charge for sewer
service will be stated in the schedule of rates and charges as
established by the city, in title 18, chapter 1 of the Columbia
Municipal Code.
(ii) Estimated billing. If a meter fails to register properly,
or if a meter is removed to be tested or repaired, or if water is
received other than through a meter, the city reserves the right to
render an estimated bill based on the best information available.
The director also reserves the right to require metering of any
water discharged into the sewer system.
(iii) Supplemental water supply. In the event that any
customer uses water from a source other than the public water
supply and discharges the wastewater into the POTW, the
customer must install or have installed according to the city's
specifications and maintain a supplementary meter to measure the
amount of water so used and the amounts so used shall be
computed in determining the wastewater service charge.
(iv) Adjustments and correction of errors. Adjustments to
billing for over or under registration of meters, for leaks, for the
determination of water use by consumers when meters have been
inoperative, for an obviously incorrect meter reading, or for other
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-52
recognized and proper adjustments as are granted to water
consumers by the city will be accepted by the city and such
adjustments for water use shall be applied in obtaining the
indicated adjustment billing for sewer charges. All other requests
for adjustments of sewer charges made to the city shall be referred
to the director who will handle such complaints. Any adjustments
or decision thus authorized by the director shall be made to the
customer affected thereby.
(v) Exemptions. Claims for exemption from the sewer
service charge because of nonavailability of sewers may be made
to the director. Exemptions from the charge will be retroactive to
the commencement date of the sewer service charge, or one (1)
year, whichever is less.
(5) Computation and assessments. The computation of and assessment
of surcharges, monitoring charges, maintenance charges and testing or analysis
charges shall be subject to the appeals procedure provided in this chapter.
(Ord. #3352, March 2000, as replaced by Ord. #3932, Dec. 2012, and Ord. #4153,
Sept. 2017)
18-215. Administrative enforcement remedies. (1) Correction of
violation. In order to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the director shall
correct any violation thereof. Any person or user who violates any provision of
this chapter, requirements or conditions set forth in permits duly issued, or who
discharges wastewater which causes pollution or violates any cease and desist
order, prohibition, effluent limitation, national standard of performance,
pretreatment or toxicity standard, is strictly liable and shall be subject to any
and all enforcement provisions of this chapter. The director shall be guided by
the Industrial Pretreatment Enforcement Response Guide, but shall be able to
exercise all remedies and enforcement actions authorized by this chapter and
state and federal laws and regulations.
(2) Notification of violation. Whenever the director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, or a wastewater permit
or order issued hereunder, the director or his agent may serve upon said user
written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt date of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the use of liability of
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(3) Consent orders. The director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the
noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user
to correct the non-compliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-53
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders
issued pursuant to § 18-215(5) below.
(4) Show cause hearing. The director may order any industrial user
which causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days
prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive,
general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial
user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
(5) Compliance order. When the director finds that an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate the chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the
discharge directing that following a specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also
contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
(6) Cease and desist order. When the director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
(a) Comply forthwith.
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
(7) Administrative penalties. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, or
permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be penalized in an amount not to
exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer
service charge and the director shall have such other collection remedies as he
has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges and penalties shall
constitute a lien against the individual user's property.
(8) Emergency suspensions. (a) The director may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial
user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-54
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the
environment.
(b) Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The director shall allow the user
to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection (9)
below are initialed against the user.
(c) An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part,
for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken
to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of the
hearing described in paragraph (b) above.
(9) Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to
discharge into the POTW, must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from
the control authority. Any user who violates the following conditions of this
chapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state or
federal law, is subject to permit termination:
(a) Violation of permit conditions.
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. Non compliant industrial
users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater
permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under paragraph (4)
above why the proposed action should not be taken.
(10) Reconsiderations/appeals. (a) Any user, permit applicant, or permit
holder affected by any decision, action, or determination, including cease
and desist orders, made by the director interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this chapter or in the granting or refusing of any permit
issued hereunder, may file with the director a written request for
reconsideration within ten (10) days of such decision, action, or
determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's
request for reconsideration. The director's decision, action, or
determination shall remain in full force and effect during such period of
reconsideration and during the appeal therefrom.
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-55
(b) If the ruling made by the director is unsatisfactory to the
person requesting reconsideration, he may, within ten (10) days after
notification of the action, file a written appeal to the wastewater appeals
board. The written appeal shall be heard within thirty (30) days from the
date of filing. The board shall make a final decision on the appeal within
fifteen (15) days of the close of the meeting. The decision, action, or
determination of the wastewater appeals board shall remain in effect
during the pending of any appeal to the courts unless the same is
modified or suspended by a court of competent jurisdiction after notice
and an evidentiary hearing.
(c) The wastewater appeals board shall be appointed by the
Mayor of Columbia and approved by the city council. It shall consist of
three (3) members, one (1) to represent industries near or in Columbia
which do not discharge to the POTW, one (1) to represent water quality
regulators from governments near Columbia, and one (1) person to
represent those eligible to vote in Columbia, which person must have
sufficient technical qualifications to enable them to understand the
scientific basis of this chapter. The first member appointed shall serve a
one (1) year term. The second appointed shall serve a two (2) year term.
The third and subsequent years' appointments shall serve three (3) year
terms. The director shall serve as nonvoting executive secretary to the
wastewater appeals board. Each member of the wastewater appeals
board shall receive a per diem of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each
meeting called to consider appeals from wastewater department
customers. The wastewater appeals board shall not meet more often than
once per appeal. (Ord. #3352, March 2000, as replaced by Ord .3932, Dec.
2012, and Ord. #4153, Sept. 2017)
18-216. Judicial remedies. (1) Judicial remedies. If any person
discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater
disposal system contrary to the provisions of this ordinance or any order or
permit issued hereunder, the director, through the city attorney, may commence
an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the circuit court and/or
chancery court for Maury County, Tennessee.
(2) Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this ordinance or permit or order issued
hereunder, the director, through counsel may petition the court for the issuance
of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user. The director
shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer
service charges.
(3) Civil penalties. (a) Any industrial user who has violated or
continues to violate this ordinance or permit or order issued hereunder,
shall be liable to the director for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-56
plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as
long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty
and damages, the director may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses.
(b) The director shall petition the court to impose, assess, and
recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration,
any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation,
corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4) Criminal prosecution. (a) Violations - generally. (i) Any industrial
user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
ordinance or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a penalty not
to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per violation per day
or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year or both.
(ii) In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more
that three (3) years or both.
(b) Falsifying information. (i) Any industrial user who
knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
ordinance, or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished
by a penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one (1)
year or both.
(ii) In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more
than three (3) years or both. (Ord. #3352, March 2000, as replaced
by Ord. #3932, Dec. 2012, and Ord. #4153, Sept. 2017)
18-217. Supplemental enforcement remedies. (1) Annual
publication of significant violations. The director shall publish, at least
annually in the largest daily newspaper circulated in the service area, a
description of those industrial users which are found to be in significant
violation, as defined in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii), with any provisions of this
ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-57
previous publication. An industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its
violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the
measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits for the same pollutant parameter.
(b) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the
measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month
period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit,
instantaneous limit, or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH).
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by § 18-207(2) (daily maximum, longer term
average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the director
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public.
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has
resulted in the POTWs exercise of its emergency authority under
paragraph §18-215(8) to halt or prevent such a discharge.
(e) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule
date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance.
(f) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules.
(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(h) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include
a violation of BMPs, which the city determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(2) Performance bonds. The director may decline to reissue a permit
to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this
ordinance or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user
first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
(3) Liability insurance. The director may decline to reissue a permit
to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this
Change 7, June 14, 2018 18-58
ordinance or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the
industrial user first submits proof that is has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.
(4) Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues
to violate the provisions of this ordinance or an order or permit issued
hereunder, water service to the user may be severed and service will only
recommence at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its
ability to comply.
(5) Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this ordinance or permit or order issued hereunder is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
director or his designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of the Columbia Municipal Code governing such
nuisances, including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing,
abating, or remedying said nuisance.
(6) Informant rewards. The director is authorized to pay up to five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for information leading to the discovery of
noncompliance by an industrial user. In the event that the information provided
results in an administrative penalty or civil penalty levied against the user, the
director is authorized to disperse up to ten percent (10%) of the collected penalty
to the informant. However, a single reward payment may not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
(7) Contractor listings. (a) Industrial users which have not achieved
consistent compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale

director upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the
director may require the industrial user to submit a written report
explaining the causes, nature, and duration of the bypass, and the steps
being taken to prevent its recurrence.
(c) An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the
treatment system. Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit
notice to the director at least ten (10) days in advance. The director may
only approve the anticipated bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set
forth in § 18-218(2)(a). (Ord. #3352, March 2000, as replaced by Ord.

Change 6, October 8, 2017 18-67
(6) "Superintendent." The Superintendent of the Columbia Water
System or his authorized representative. (1968 Code, § 8-301)
18-402. Standards. The Columbia Water System is to comply with
Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-701 through 68-221-720 as well as the
Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems, legally adopted in accordance
with the State of Tennessee, which pertain to cross-connections and bypasses,
and establish an effective ongoing program to control same. (1968 Code,
§ 8-302)
18-403. Construction, operation, and supervision. No person shall
cause a cross-connection or by-pass, to be made, or allow one to exist for any
purpose whatsoever unless the construction and operation of same have been
approved by the Tennessee Department of Health and the operation of such
cross-connection or bypass, is at all times under the direct supervision of the
superintendent. (1968 Code, § 8-303)
18-404. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply, and who also has on the same
premises an auxiliary intake or stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water stored therein is circulated through a
piping system, shall file with the superintendent a statement of the
non-existence of unapproved or unauthorized cross-connections. Such statement
shall also contain an agreement that no cross-connection will be permitted upon
the premises. (1968 Code, § 8-304)
18-405. Inspections required. Columbia Water System will have the
authority to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the public
water supply where cross-connections with the public water system are deemed

have the right to enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by the
public water supply for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems
therein for cross-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. The
refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested, shall be deemed
grounds for the Columbia Water System to immediately terminate water
service. (1968 Code, § 8-306)
Change 6, October 8, 2017 18-68
18-407. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross-connections in violation of this policy shall be allowed a reasonable time,
not to exceed thirty (30) days (unless a special extension of said time is
requested in writing and granted by the Columbia Water System), within which
to comply with the provisions of this policy. After a thorough investigation of
existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the superintendent.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this policy and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
Columbia Water System shall be grounds for denial of access to the public water
supply. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the
utility shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be
discontinued and shall physically separate the public water supply from the
customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two systems cannot
again be connected by an unauthorized person.
Where cross connections are found that constitute an extreme hazard of
immediate concern of contaminating the public water system, the manager of
the utility shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate
the threat to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to
disconnect the public water supply from the on-site piping system unless the
imminent hazard is corrected immediately. (1968 Code, § 8-307)
18-408. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water department is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the system, or his designated
representative, that the water use and protective features of the plumbing are
such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water supply.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected.
Then in such event, the superintendent shall require the use of an
approved protective device on the service line serving the premises to assure
that any contamination that may originate in the customer's premises is
contained therein. The protective device shall be a reduced pressure zone type
backflow preventer approved by the Tennessee Department of Health as to
manufacturer, model, and size. The method of installation of backflow
protective devices shall be approved by the superintendent prior to installation
and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of
Health. The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or occupant of the
premises.
Change 6, October 8, 2017 18-69
The Columbia Water System shall have the right to inspect and test the
device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed necessary by the
superintendent. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the device without
the knowledge of the occupant of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and
the continuance of service may be critical, the superintendent shall notify the
occupant of the premises in writing, of plans to discontinue water service and
arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test and/or repair the device. The
water system shall require the occupant of the premises to make all repairs
indicated promptly, and the expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner
or occupant of the premises. These repairs shall be made by qualified personnel
acceptable to the superintendent.
If necessary, water service shall be discontinued (following legal
notification) for failure to maintain backflow prevention devices in proper
working order. Likewise, removing, bypassing, or altering of the protective
device(s), so as to render the device(s) ineffective shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises shall not be
restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or
defects to the satisfaction of the Columbia Water System. (1968 Code, § 8-308)
18-409. Application of chapter. The requirements contained herein
shall apply to all premises served by the Columbia Water System regardless of
political subdivision boundaries, and are hereby made a part of the conditions
required to be met for the Columbia Water System to provide water service to
any premises. This chapter being essential for the protection of water
distribution system against the entrance of contamination which may render the
water unsafe or otherwise undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard
to location of the premises or to boundaries of any political subdivision served
by the public water supply. (1968 Code, § 8-309)
18-410. Discontinuance of water service for noncompliance.
Whenever any person neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter, the superintendent shall discontinue the public water supply
service at any premises upon which there is found a cross-connection, and
service shall not be restored until such cross-connection has been discontinued.

hear the appeal as soon as practicable but not later than thirty (30) days
after the request for a hearing. During such hearing, evidence will be
considered to determine whether a public nuisance exists in violation of
this section. Following such hearing an order will be issued if a nuisance
is found to exist providing for the abatement of such nuisance by the city
or the owner or occupant of the premises. Any order requiring the
removal of a vehicle or part thereof shall include a description of the
vehicle and the correct identification number and license number of the
vehicle, if available at the site. The decision of the committee shall be
final except for whatever rights the owner and/or occupant may have for
judicial review.
(6) Removal with permission of owner or occupant. At any time ten
(10) days after receipt of notice from the city manager, or his/her designee to
abate the nuisance as herein provided, the owner or occupant of the premises
may give his/her written permission to the City of Columbia to remove an
inoperable or abandoned vehicle from the premises at the expense of the owner
and/or occupant. The giving of such permission shall be considered compliance
with the provisions of this section.
(7) Removal without permission of owner or occupant. (a) If such
public nuisance is not abated by any person owning or occupying the real
property where such vehicle is located, whether as owner, tenant,
occupant, lessee or otherwise, and an inoperable or abandoned vehicle
remains on said property following the ten (10) days' notice period
specified in subsection (5)(a), with no hearing requested by the owner or
20-9
occupant of said property where the vehicle is located, official action shall

specified in this section, the city manager or his/her designee shall apply

property to examine vehicles or parts thereof, obtain information as to the
identity of the owners of vehicles and to remove or cause the removal of
a vehicle or parts thereof declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this
section. The City of Columbia Municipal Court shall have the authority
to issue all orders and warrants necessary to enforce this section.
(c) The city manager or his/her designee, may enter upon
private property for the purposes specified in this section to examine
vehicles or parts thereof, obtain information as to the identity of vehicles,
and to remove or cause the removal of a vehicle or parts thereof declared
to be a nuisance pursuant to this section. Any such inoperable or
abandoned vehicle shall be impounded at the cost of the owner of the
vehicle or the person owning or occupying the real property for which the
vehicle was removed until lawfully claimed or disposed of in accordance
with this section.
(8) Immediate removal authorized. Nothing in this section shall affect
the power of the city to permit immediate removal of a vehicle left on public
property, which constitutes an obstruction to traffic.
(9) Collection of abatement expense; lien. When any nuisance has
been abated by the city as provided in this section, all expenses, including
administrative fees, incurred in abating same shall be billed to the owner of the
vehicle or the person owning or occupying the real property from which such
vehicle was removed and shall become a lien against said real property. If the
owner of the vehicle or the person owning or occupying the property from which
such vehicle was removed, fails to pay the costs and administrative fees, such
costs and fees shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
delinquent real property taxes. In the alternative, the city may collect the costs
and administrative fees assessed through an action for debt filed in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
(10) Violations, penalty. Any person violating any of the provisions of
this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for

playgrounds, city parks or any other appropriate city locations for not less than
forty (40) hours nor more than six (6) months.

subsection (1) the court may in its discretion require a person convicted under

department officer is dispatched to or otherwise learns of the activation of any
alarm system. If the user calls or the authorized agent calls the police
communications center back within five minutes of the original call, it will not
be considered a false alarm. No violation, fine, or recourse will take place in the
above time interval unless the responding Columbia police officer or fire officer

who owns, operates, leases or controls any premise, commercial or residential,
having an alarm system, shall be cited to Columbia Municipal Court for any
response to a false alarm. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of a conviction the
person shall show proof to the police department of the corrective action taken
to remedy the problem/situation. Failure to show corrective action will be
grounds for revocation of the permit; however, no disconnection shall be ordered
on any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation. (1968
Code, § 13-408)
20-209. Enforcement. Columbia police and fire department officers are
specifically authorized to enforce this chapter. Any Columbia police or fire

20-402. Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, unless a different
meaning clearly appears in the context, the following definitions of terms shall
be used in its interpretation:
(1) "Benefitted property; property to be benefitted and frontage." The
city council may assess the expense of improvements on the property benefitted
by the improvements, or upon the property adjoining and contiguous or abutting
upon such improvements, in proportion to the frontage, or according to benefits,
as determined by the council.
(2) "Costs." Cost of labor, materials, equipment necessary to complete
an improvement, land, easements, and other necessary expenses connected with
an improvement including preliminary and other surveys, inspections of the
work, engineers' fees and costs, attorney fees, fiscal agent fees, preparation of
plans and specifications, publication expenses, interest which may become due
on bonds before collection of the improvement assessments, a reasonable
allowance for unforeseen contingencies, and other costs of financing.
(3) "Improvement." Construction, installation or substantial
reconstruction of sanitary sewers; construction, substantial reconstruction, or
widening of streets, sidewalks and other public ways, including necessary storm
drainage facilities, curb and gutter, or any combination of the foregoing.
(4) "Sanitary sewer." An underground conduit for the passage of
sewerage, and pumping stations, pressure lines, and outlets where deemed
necessary. (1968 Code, § 6-702)
20-403. Improvements and issuance of bonds authorized. The City
of Columbia is hereby authorized to provide for, construct, and issue bonds, if
20-21
necessary, to finance the improvements heretofore defined as provided in
Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 7-33-101 to 7-33-318. (1968 Code, § 6-703)
20-404. Improvement procedure. When the City Council of the City
of Columbia shall determine to consider construction of an improvement
heretofore defined; or, when the City Council of the City of Columbia is
petitioned by a group of interested owners of property and the said city council
decides to study the project feasibility, the city council shall adopt a resolution
providing for preliminary plans and estimates of the costs to be prepared by the
wastewater department for all sanitary sewers and by the city engineering
department for all other improvements and to render a report to the city council.
Following receipt of the above described report and upon determination by the
city council that the project should be constructed, a subsequent resolution shall
be adopted describing the project and geographical limits of same and making
a declaration that the improvement will be designed and constructed and will
be supervised by the city. A statement shall also be made as to the proportion
of total costs to be assessed against benefitted properties, which shall not exceed
two thirds (2/3) of the total costs of the improvement; provided, however, that
the total costs may be assessed against benefitted properties if the property
owners who own seventy five percent (75%) of the front footage to be benefitted
petition the city council for an improvement and state in their petition that they
agree to pay the total cost of said project. In all succeeding proceedings, the city
shall be bound and limited by the resolution as it may be amended, except that
the total costs assessed against benefitted properties may exceed the
preliminary estimate of costs by not more than ten percent (10%). The
resolution shall provide for a public hearing before the city council at a time and
a place specified therein. The city shall publish a notice of the hearing at least
seven (7) days in advance of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
in the municipality and by posting same at the city hall. Said notice shall state
that any owner of property to be benefitted may appear to be heard as to:
(1) Whether the proposed improvement should be undertaken as
planned, or abandoned, and
(2) Whether the design, costs, cost allocation, or scope of the
improvement should be altered.
Said notice shall be sent by first class mail to the owners of properties to
be benefitted or their agents of record at the time of adoption of the resolution
at the address currently entered on the property assessment records. (1968
Code, § 6-704)
20-405. Public hearing, final action of city, and petition for
certiorari. At the public hearing required herein, or at the time and place to
which same may be adjourned from time to time, all persons whose property
may be affected by such improvement may appear in person, by attorney, or by
petition. After said public hearing and after considering any objections, the city
20-22
council shall confirm, amend or rescind the resolution authorizing the project as
its final action. Such final action shall be the final determination of the issues
presented unless the owner of property to be benefitted files, within ten (10)
days thereafter, a petition for certiorari in the circuit court having jurisdiction
to review the action of the governing body. Failure to take such steps within
said ten (10) days shall constitute a waiver of all objections. (1968 Code,
§ 6-705)
20-406. Construction bids, performance bond and construction
by city's own forces. If the project is to be constructed by contract, the city
council may authorize receipt of proposals for the construction of an
improvement which shall be solicited by sealed competitive bids after public
advertisement at least once in a newspaper having general circulation in the
municipality not less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for receipt of bids.
The governing body may accept a bid, or combination of bids, or, without bids,
it may direct that the improvement be accomplished by the municipality's own
forces. The city council may also authorize the inclusion of the project to
another contract for which bids have been or may be received. The city council
may authorize the work to be completed by a combination of contract, contracts,
and city forces. (1968 Code, § 6-706)
20-407. Assessments. After the completion of the work, it shall be the
duty of the city council in conformity with the requirements of the design and
construction resolution to apportion the applicable cost and expense of such
improvement or improvements upon the land abutting on or adjacent to said
street, highway, avenue, alley, or other public place improved, which
appointment shall be made against said land, and the several lots or parcels on
said street, highway, avenue, alley or other public place, provided, however, that
the aggregate or total amount of the levy or assessment made upon or against
any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed one-half (½) of the cash value of said
lot and improvements thereon. Cash value shall be identified in Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 7-32-116.
Where intersections of any street, avenue, highway, or other public place
are improved, the City of Columbia shall pay one-third of the cost thereof, and
the balance shall be assessed against the property of the streets improved. The
cost of any improvement contemplated shall be established by the city council
and may include the expense of the preliminary and other surveys, and the
inspection and superintendence of such work, the preparation of plans and
specifications, the printing and publishing of notices, resolutions, and
ordinances required, including notice of assessment, preparing bonds, interest
on bonds, and other expense necessary for the completion of such improvement
or improvements; provided, however, that the cost of any guaranty or
maintenance of any work constructed under these provisions shall not be
20-23
assessed against the property abutting on or adjacent to any street, avenue,
highways or other public place improved. (1968 Code, § 6-707)
20-408. Assessment resolution and hearing. When the costs have
been compiled for the improvements, the city recorder, or such person as may
be designated by the city council shall thereupon publish a notice of a public
hearing before the city council to consider the assessment resolution and said
notice shall contain a time and date for the public hearing and a statement to
the effect that an assessment list has been completed and that, on the day
named, which shall be not less than ten (10) days after the date of publication
of said notice, the city council will consider any and all objections to said costs
or assessments that have been filed in the office of said recorder or such person
designated.
Said notice shall further recite that said lists are in the office of said
recorder or person designated, and may be inspected within business hours of
the City of Columbia and during the ten (10) day period by anyone interested.
Said notice shall describe the general character and location of the
improvement. All persons whose property it is proposed to assess for the costs
of said improvement, or improvements, may at any time, on or before the date
named in such notice, and before said meeting of the city council, file in writing
with the recorder, or person designated, any objection or defenses to the
proposed assessment or to the amount thereof. On the date named in said notice
or to any day to which said meeting may be adjourned, or to which the
consideration of said assessment and the objections thereto may be postponed,
said city council shall hear and consider said assessment and objections thereto,
and after so doing, shall confirm, modify or set aside said assessment as shall
be deemed right and proper. If no objection to the pro rata or the amount
thereof is filed, or if the property owners fail to appear in person, or by attorney,
and insist upon the same, the assessment shall be confirmed and made final;
and the property owners who do not file objections in writing or protest against
said assessment shall be held to have consented to the same and forever barred
to attack the regularity, validity, or legality of said assessment. Such
confirmation and final action by said city council shall be done by resolution at
a single meeting of said body.
All such assessments shall be and constitute a lien on the respective lots
or parcels of land upon which they are levied, superior to all other liens except
those of the state and county and city, for taxes. The enforcement of the state,
county and city of its liens for taxes on any lot or parcel of land upon which has
been levied an assessment for any improvement authorized herein shall not
operate to discharge, or in any manner affect the City of Columbia's lien for such
assessment; but a purchaser at a tax sale by the state, county or city of any lot
or parcel of land upon which said assessment had been levied shall take the
same subject to the lien of such assessment, and if bought by the state, any
conveyance of the title thus acquired or any redemption shall be subject to the
20-24
lien of such assessment; provided, however, that any error, mistake of name,
number of lot, amount, or other irregularity may at any time be corrected; and
no such levy or assessment shall ever be declared void or invalid by reason
thereof, but the person aggrieved may have the same corrected by application
to the city council of said City of Columbia. If in any court of competent
jurisdiction any final assessment is set aside for irregularity, omissions or
defects in the proceedings, then the city council, may, after notice as required
in the making of the assessment resolution, make a new assessment in
accordance with the provisions herein.
All assessments levied by virtue of this chapter shall be due and payable
within thirty (30) days after the assessment has been made final as aforesaid;
however a property owner may notify the city in writing that he elects to pay
said assessment in five (5) annual installments as herein provided and said
assessment amount shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum
on the unpaid balance. A property owner desiring to exercise the privilege of
payment by installment shall, before the expiration of the thirty days, enter into
an agreement in writing with said city. Providing that in consideration of such
privilege he will make no objection to any illegality or irregularity with regard
to the assessment against his property, and will pay the same as agreed with
the specified interest and all costs of collection, including a reasonable attorney
fee, upon default as hereinafter provided. Said agreement shall be filed in the
office of the city recorder, or person designated, and in all cases where such
agreement has not been signed and filed within the time limited, the entire
assessment shall be payable in full without interest before the expiration of said
thirty days; provided, that any property owner who shall have elected in writing
to pay his assessment in five annual installments shall have the right and
privilege of paying the assessment in full at any installment period by paying
the full amount of the installments, together with all accrued interest. If any
property owner shall default in the payment of any installment and interest
thereon, all of said installments, with interest, shall become immediately due
and payable.
The City of Columbia may permit owners of benefitted property to pay
improvement assessments, plus interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per
annum on the unpaid balance and reasonable collection costs, in consecutive
equal monthly installments not to exceed a term of five (5) years. The first
installment shall be due and payable when the improvement assessment is due.
A monthly payment shall be delinquent thirty (30) days after it is due and
payable, and the unpaid balance of the improvement assessment, plus all
accrued interest and all costs of collection, including a reasonable attorney fee,
shall be due and payable immediately.
After the city council shall have levied said assessments against the
property abutting on or adjacent to such street, highway, avenue, alley, or other
public improvement, the said recorder or person designated, shall enter same
upon the accounts of the City of Columbia to conveniently show:
20-25
(1) Name of owner of such property.
(2) The number of lot or part of lot and the plat thereof, if there be a
plat.
(3) The frontage of said lot and the depth thereof.
(4) The amount that has been assessed against such lot.
(5) Method of payment.
Said accounts shall be indexed according to the name of the owners of the
property and according to the location of the improvements.
Whenever any installment of any assessments shall become past due for
a period of sixty days, it shall be the duty of the recorder to certify said
delinquent installments, and all other installments of the same assessment to
the city attorney, whose duty it shall be to immediately enforce the collection of
said assessment, plus accrued interest and costs of collection herein above set
forth.
In case of any such default the lien hereunder shall be enforced in the
Chancery Court of Maury County, Tennessee.
Any land attached may be sold in an attachment proceeding in bar of the
equity of redemption, and all other rights legal or equitable, belonging to the
owners of said land. (1968 Code, § 6-708)
20-409. Municipal, state and federal property subject to
assessments. Benefitted property owned by the municipality, county, the State
of Tennessee, the United States Government, or their agencies (if federal law
makes such property subject to assessment) shall be subject to improvement
assessments, the same as private properties, and the amount of each annual
improvement assessment shall be paid by the municipality, county, State of
Tennessee, United States Government, or their agencies, as the case may be.
In the case of the State of Tennessee, the amount of the improvement
assessment shall be certified by the municipality to the commissioner of finance
and administration, who shall direct the state treasurer to pay the same to the
municipality out of an appropriate appropriation or from any money in the state
treasury not otherwise appropriated. No benefitted property shall be exempt
from improvement assessments. Improvement assessments against such public
property shall be enforceable by writ of mandamus or other appropriate remedy.

i. "Governing body" means the city council or mayor, whichever may
be applicable to the local government, government agency, or
utility to which this plan applies.
j. "Imminent danger" means any conditions or practices in any place
of employment which are such that a hazard exists which could
reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm
immediately or before the imminence of such hazard can be
eliminated through normal compliance enforcement procedures.
k. "Inspector(s)" means the individual(s) appointed or designated by
the director of occupational safety and health to conduct
inspections provided for herein. If no such compliance inspector(s)

cause permanent or prolonged impairment of the body in that:
1. A part of the body would be permanently removed
(e.g., amputation of an arm, leg, finger(s); loss of an
eye) or rendered functionally useless or substantially
reduced in efficiency on or off the job (e.g., leg
shattered so severely that mobility would be
permanently reduced), or
2. A part of an internal body system would be inhibited
in its normal performance or function to such a
degree as to shorten life or cause reduction in
physical or mental efficiency (e.g., lung impairment

VI. Administration. a. The Fire Chief for the City of Columbia is
hereby designated as the director of occupational safety and health and is
designated to perform duties or to exercise powers assigned so as to administer
this occupational safety and health program.
1. The department director may designate person or persons
as he deems necessary to carry out his powers, duties, and
responsibilities under this program.
2. The department director may delegate the power to make
inspections, provided procedures employed are as effective
as those employed by the director.
3. The director shall employ measures to coordinate, to the
extent possible, activities of all departments to promote
efficiency and to minimize any inconveniences under this
program.
4. The director may request qualified technical personnel from

him. He shall report such accidents, injuries, or illnesses to
the director along with his findings and/or recommendations
in accordance with Appendix V of this plan. (Ord. #3482,
Nov. 2002)
VII. Standards authorized. The standards adopted under this
program are the applicable standards developed and promulgated under section
VI (6) of the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1972 or which
may, in the future, be developed and promulgated. Additional standards may
be promulgated by the governing body of this employer as that body may deem
necessary for the safety and health of employees. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
VIII. Variance procedure. The director of safety may apply for a
variance as a result of a complaint from an employee or of his knowledge of
certain hazards or exposures. The director of safety should definitely believe
that a variance is needed before the application for a variance is submitted to
the Commissioner of Labor.
The procedure for applying for a variance to the adopted safety and health
standards is as follows:
a. The application for a variance shall be prepared in writing and
shall contain:
1. A specification of the standard or portion thereof from which
the variance is sought.
2. A detailed statement of the reason(s) why the employer is
unable to comply with the standard supported by
A-10
representations by qualified personnel having first-hand
knowledge of the facts represented.
3. A statement of the steps the employer has taken and will
take (with specific date) to protect employees against the
hazard covered by the standard.
4. A statement of when the employer expects to comply and
what steps have or will be taken (with dates specified) to
come into compliance with the standard.
5. A certification that the employer has informed employees,
their authorized representative(s), and/or interested parties
by giving them a copy of the request, posting a statement
summarizing the application (to include the location of a
copy available for examination) at the places where
employee notices are normally posted and by other
appropriate means. The certification shall contain a
description of the means actually used to inform employees
and that employees have been informed of their right to
petition the Commissioner of Labor for a hearing.
b. The application for a variance should be sent to the Commissioner
of Labor by registered or certified mail.
c. The Commissioner of Labor will review the application for a
variance and may deny the request or issue an order granting the
variance. An order granting a variance shall be issued only if it
has been established that:
1. The employer:
i. Is unable to comply with the standard by the effective
date because of unavailability of professional or technical
personnel or materials and equipment required or necessary
construction or alteration of facilities or technology.
ii. Has taken all available steps to safeguard employees
against the hazard(s) covered by the standard.
iii. Has an effective program for coming into compliance
with the standard as quickly as possible.
2. The employee is engaged in an experimental program as
described in subsection (b), section 13 of the Act.
d. A variance may be granted for a period of no longer than is
required to achieve compliance or one (1) year, whichever is
shorter.
e. Upon receipt of an application for an order granting a variance, the
commissioner to whom such application is addressed may issue an
interim order granting such a variance for the purpose of
permitting time for an orderly consideration of such application.
No such interim order may be effective for longer than one
hundred eighty (180) days.
A-11
f. The order or interim order granting a variance shall be posted at
the worksite and employees notified of such order by the same
means used to inform them of the application for said variance (see
subsection (a)(5) of this section). (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
IX. Recordkeeping and reporting. a. Recording and reporting of all
occupational accident, injuries, and illnesses shall be in accordance with
instructions and on forms prescribed in the booklet, Recordkeeping
Requirements Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,
(revised 1978) or as may be prescribed by the Tennessee Department of
Labor.
b. The position responsible for recordkeeping is shown on the Safety
and Health Organizational Chart, Appendix V to this plan.
c. Details of how reports of occupational accidents, injuries, and
illnesses will reach the recordkeeper are specified by Accident
Reporting Procedures, Appendix V to this plan. (Ord. #3482, Nov.
2002)
X. Employee complaint procedure. If any employee feels that he is
assigned to work in conditions which might affect his health, safety, or general
welfare at the present time or at any time in the future, he should report the
condition to the department safety representative and then the department
director, and then the city manager.
a. The complaint should be in the form of a letter and give details on
the condition(s) and how the employee believes it affects or will
affect his health, safety, or general welfare. The employee should
sign the letter but need not do so if he wishes to remain
anonymous (see subsection (h) of section 1 of this plan).
b. Upon receipt of the complaint letter, the safety representative will
evaluate the condition(s) and institute any corrective action, if
warranted. Within ten (10) working days following the receipt of
the complaint, the safety representative will answer the complaint
in writing stating whether or not the complaint is deemed to be
valid and if no, why not, what action has been or will be taken to
correct or abate the condition(s), and giving a designated time
period for correction or abatement. Answers to anonymous
complaints will be posted upon bulletin boards or other places of
common passage where the anonymous complaint may be
reasonably expected to be seen by the complainant for a period of
three (3) working days.
c. The city manager will evaluate the complaint and will begin to
take action to correct or abate the condition(s) through arbitration
or administrative sanctions or may find the complaint to be
invalid. An answer will be sent to the complainant within ten (10)
A-12
working days following receipt of the complaint or the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body following
receipt of the complaint explaining decisions made and action
taken or to be taken.
d. If the complainant finds the reply not satisfactory because it was
held to be invalid, the corrective action is felt to be insufficient, or
the time period for correction is felt to be too long, he may forward
a letter to the department director explaining the condition(s) cited
in his original complaint and why he believes the answer to be
inappropriate or insufficient.
e. After the above steps have been followed and the complainant is
still not satisfied with the results, he may then file a complaint
with the Commissioner of Labor. Any complaint filed with the
Commissioner of Labor in such cases shall include copies of all
related correspondence with the director or the safety
representative of the governing body.
f. Copies of all complaint and answers thereto will be filed by the
director who shall make them available to the Commissioner of
Labor or his designated representative upon request. (Ord. #3482,
Nov. 2002)
XI. Education and training. a. Director and/or safety representative:
1. Arrangements will be made for the director and/or
compliance inspector(s) to attend training seminars,
workshops, etc., conducted by the State of Tennessee or
other agencies.
2. Reference materials, manuals, equipment, etc., deemed
necessary for use in conducting compliance inspections,
conducting local training, wiring technical reports, and
informing officials, supervisors, and employees of the
existence of safety and health hazards will be furnished.
b. All employees (including supervisory personnel).
A suitable safety and health training program for employees will
be established. This program will, at a minimum:
1. Instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of
hazards or unsafe conditions and of standards and
regulations applicable to the employees work environment
to control or eliminate any hazards, unsafe conditions, or
other exposures to occupational illness or injury.
2. Instruct employees who are required to handle poisons,
acids, caustics, explosives, and other harmful or dangerous
substances in the safe handling and use of such items and
make them aware of the potential hazards, proper handling
A-13
procedures, personal protective measures, personal hygiene,
etc., which may be required.
3. Instruct employees who may be exposed to environments
where harmful plants or animals are present of the hazards
of the environment, how to best avoid injury or exposure,
and the first aid procedures to be followed in the event of
injury or exposure.
4. Instruct employees required to handle or use flammable
liquids, gases, or toxic materials in their safe handling and
use and make employees aware of specific requirements
contained in subparts H and M and other applicable
subparts of TOSHA Act Standards (1910 and/or 1926).
5. Instruct employees on hazards and dangers of confined or
enclosed spaces.
i. Confined or enclosed space means space having a
limited means of egress and which is subject to the
accumulation of toxic or flammable contaminants or
has an oxygen deficient atmosphere. Confined or
enclosed spaces include, but are not limited to,
storage tanks, boilers, ventilation or exhaust ducts,
sewers, underground utility accesses, tunnels,
pipelines, and open top spaces more than four feet
(4') in depth such as pits, tubs, vaults, and vessels.
ii. Employees will be given general instruction on
hazards involved, precautions to be taken, and on use
of personal protective and emergency equipment
required. They shall also be instructed on all specific
standards or regulations that apply to work in
dangerous or potentially dangerous areas.
iii. The immediate supervisor of any employee who must
perform work in a confined or enclosed space shall be
responsible for instructing employees on danger of
hazards which may be present, precautions to be
taken, and use of personal protective and emergency
equipment, immediately prior to their entry into such
an area and shall require use of appropriate personal
protective equipment. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XII. General inspection procedures. It is the intention of the
governing body and the responsible officials to have an occupational safety and
health program that will insure the welfare of employees. In order to be aware
of hazards, periodic inspections must be performed. These inspections will
enable the finding of hazards or unsafe conditions or operations that will need
correction in order to maintain safe and healthful worksites. Inspections made
A-14
on a pre-designated basis may not yield the desire results. Inspections will be
conducted, therefore, on a random basis at intervals not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days.
a. In order to carry out the purposes of this program, the director or
safety representative is authorized:
1. To enter at any reasonable time, any establishment, facility,
or worksite where work is being performed by an employee
when such establishment, facility, or worksite is under the
jurisdiction of the employer and;
2. To inspect and investigate during regular working hours
and at other reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and
in a reasonable manner, any such place of employment and
all pertinent conditions, processes, structures, machines,
apparatus, devices, equipment, and materials therein, and
to question privately any supervisor, operator, agent, or
employee working therein.
b. If an imminent danger situation is found, alleged, or otherwise
brought to the attention of the safety representative during a
routine inspection, he shall immediately inspect the imminent
danger situation in accordance with section XII of this plan before
inspecting the remaining portions of the establishment, facility, or
worksite.
c. An administrative representative of the employer and a
representative authorized by the employees shall be given an
opportunity to consult with and/or to accompany the director or
inspector during the physical inspection of any worksite for the
purpose of aiding such inspection.
d. The right of accompaniment may be denied any person whose
conduct interferes with a full and orderly inspection.
e. The conduct of the inspection shall be such as to preclude
unreasonable disruptions of the operation(s) of the workplace.
f. Interviews of employees during the course of the inspection may be
made when such interviews are considered essential to
investigative techniques.
g. Advance notice of inspections.
1. Generally, advance notice of inspections will not be given
as this precludes the opportunity to make minor or
temporary adjustments in an attempt to create a misleading
impression of conditions in an establishment.
2. There may be occasions when advance notice of inspections
will be necessary in order to conduct an effective inspection
or investigation. When advance notice of inspection is
given, employees of their authorized representative(s) will
also be given notice of the inspection.
A-15
h. The safety representative need not personally make an inspection
of each and every worksite once every thirty (30) days. He may
delegate the responsibility for such inspections to supervisors of
other personnel provided:
1. Inspections conducted by the safety representative are at
least as effective as those made by the director.
2. Records are made of the inspections and of any
discrepancies found and are forwarded to the director.
i. The safety committee shall maintain records of inspections to
include identification of worksite inspected, date of inspection,
description of violations of standards or other unsafe conditions or
practices found, and corrective action taken toward abatement.
Said inspection records shall be subject to review by the
Commissioner of Labor or his authorized representative.
(Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XIII. Imminent danger procedures.
a. Any discovery, any allegation, or any report of imminent danger
shall be handled in accordance with the following procedures:
1. The immediate supervisor shall immediately be informed of
the alleged imminent danger situation and he shall
immediately ascertain whether there is a reasonable basis
for the allegation.
2. If the alleged imminent danger situation is determined to
have merit by the director, he shall make or cause to be
made an immediate inspection of the alleged imminent
danger location.
3. As soon as it is concluded from such inspection that
conditions or practices exist which constitute an imminent
danger, the director or safety representative shall attempt
to have the danger corrected. All employees at the location
shall be informed of the danger and the supervisor or person
in charge of the worksite shall be requested to remove
employees from the area, if deemed necessary.
4. The department director or operational head of the
workplace in which the imminent danger exists, or his
authorized representative, shall be responsible for
determining the manner in which the imminent danger
situation will be abated. This shall be done in cooperation
with the director or safety representative and to the mutual
satisfaction of all parties involved.
5. The imminent danger shall be deemed abated if:
i. The imminence of the danger has been eliminated by
removal of employees from the area of danger.
A-16
ii. Conditions or practices which resulted in the
imminent danger have been eliminated or corrected
to the point where an unsafe condition or practice no
longer exists.
6. A written report shall be made by or to the director
describing in detail the imminent danger and its abatement.
This report will be maintained by the director in accordance
with subsection (i) of section XI of this plan.
b. Refusal to abate.
1. Any refusal to abate an imminent danger situation shall be
reported to the department director and safety director
immediately.
2. The department director and safety director shall take
whatever action may be necessary to achieve abatement.
(Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XIV. Abatement orders and hearings.
a. Whenever, as a result of an inspection or investigation, the safety
representative finds that a worksite is not in compliance with the
standards, rules or regulations pursuant to this plan and is unable
to negotiate abatement with the administrative or operational
head of the worksite within a reasonable period of time, the safety
committee shall:
1. Issue an abatement order to the head of the worksite.
2. Post, or cause to be posted, a copy of the abatement order at
or near each location referred to in the abatement order.
b. Abatement orders shall contain the following information:
1. The standard, rule, or regulation which was found to be
violated.
2. A description of the nature and location of the violation.
3. A description of what is required to abate or correct the
violation.
4. A reasonable period of time during which the violation must
be abated or corrected.
c. At any time within ten (10) days after receipt of an abatement
order, anyone affected by the order may advise the safety
committee in writing of any objections to the terms and conditions
of the order. Upon receipt of such objections, the director shall act
promptly to hold a hearing with all interested and/or responsible
parties in an effort to resolve any objections. Following such
hearing, the safety committee shall, within three (3) working days,
issue an abatement order and such subsequent order shall be
binding on all parties and shall be final. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
A-17
XV. Penalties.
a. No civil or criminal penalties shall be issued against any official,
employee, or any other person for failure to comply with safety and
health standards or any rules or regulations issued pursuant to
this program.
b. Any employee, regardless of status, who willfully and/or repeatedly
violates, or causes to be violated, any safety and health standard,
rule, or regulation or any abatement order shall be subject to
disciplinary action by the appointing authority. It shall be the
duty of the appointing authority to administer discipline by taking
action as appropriate by the City of Columbia Progressive
Discipline Policy adopted August 6, 1998, located in Section 19 of
the Employee Policy Manual. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XVI. Confidentiality of privileged information. All information
obtained by or reported to the safety committee pursuant to this plan of
operation or the legislation (ordinance, or executive order) enabling this
occupational safety and health program which contains or might reveal
information which is otherwise privileged shall be considered confidential but
shall be subject to the open records law. Such information may be disclosed to
other officials or employees concerned with carrying out this program or when
relevant in any proceeding under this program. Such information may also be
disclosed to the Commissioner of Labor or their authorized representatives in
carrying out their duties under the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1972. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XVII. Compliance with other laws not excused.
a. Compliance with any other law, statute, ordinance, or executive
order, as applicable, which regulates safety and health in
employment and places of employment shall not excuse the
employer, the employee, or any other person from compliance with
the provisions of this program.
b. Compliance with any provisions of this program or any standard,
rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to this program shall not
excuse the employer, the employee, or any other person from
compliance with the law, statute, ordinance, or executive order, as
applicable, regulating and promoting safety and health unless such
law, statute, ordinance, or executive order, as applicable, is
specifically repealed. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)
XVIII. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
program is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed separate, distinct,
A-18
and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portions hereof. (Ord. #3482, Nov. 2002)

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM PLAN
APPENDIX III
NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY OF COLUMBIA
The Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1972 provides job safety
and health protection for Tennessee workers through the promotion of safe and
healthful working conditions. Under a plan reviewed by the Tennessee
Department of Labor, this government, as an employer, is responsible for
administering the Act to its employees. Safety and health standards are the
same as state standards and jobsite inspections will be conducted to insure
compliance with the Act.
Employees shall be furnished conditions of employment and a place of
employment free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious injury or harm to employees.
Each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and
all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this program which are
applicable to his or her own actions and conduct.
Each employee shall be notified by the placing upon bulletin boards or other
places of common passage, of any application for a temporary variance from any
standard or regulation.
Each employee shall be given the opportunity to participate in any hearing
which concerns an application for a variance from a standard.
Any employee who may be adversely affected by a standard or variance issued
pursuant to this program may file a petition with the director then the chief
executive officer.
Any employee who has been exposed or is being exposed to toxic materials or
harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels in excess of that provided

3.12.4 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW
In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Historic Zoning Commission shall be guided by the following criteria:
Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that A.requires a minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its B.environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature shall be avoided.
All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. C.Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and D.development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a E.building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever F.possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. G.Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources H.affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be I.discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment.

3.17.1 General
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
3-40 City of Columbia
SEC. 3.17 ZONING ORDINANCE AMENDMENT Commentary: A Zoning Ordinance Amendment is substantially different from a Rezoning. When amending the Zoning Ordinance, this document is being changed. For example, the setback requirements for a zoning district might be modified to allow a smaller side yard than previously required. A Rezoning is actually changing the zoning as applied to a particular piece of property (as shown on the Zoning Map). For example, if a property is changed from a single-family Residential district to a highway service commercial district, the uses permitted on the property are drastically different.
3.17.1 GENERAL
The City Council may, from time to time, amend this Ordinance by changing any provisions whenever it is alleged that there was an error in the original Zoning Ordinance or whenever the public necessity, convenience, and general welfare require such amendment.
3.17.2 COORDINATION WITH PLANS

A petition for Zoning Ordinance amendment shall not be approved by the City Council when there is a conflict with the General Plan or applicable local plans, as determined by the Planning Commission (see Sec. 3.4, Plan Amendment/Adoption).

3.17.3 INITIATION OF AMENDMENT
Zoning Ordinance amendments may be initiated by the City Council, the Planning Commission, Zoning Administrator or by an application by any other interested citizen of Columbia.

Preliminary Approval hearing before Planning Commission ? Preliminary Approval hearing before City Council ? Final Approval hearing before Planning Commission Specific procedures are detailed in this section.
3.20.2 CONSISTENCY WITH AREA DEVELOPMENT PLANS
No PUD shall be approved unless all plans for development are found to be consistent with the then current issue of the General Plan of Columbia and any adopted special development plan for the area in which the development is proposed. The Planning Commission shall make a formal, written finding regarding the consistency of any proposed PUD, said report to include findings that the development:
Will be consistent with the currently effective General Plan as well as A.any special development plan for the area;
Is likely to be compatible with development permitted under the general B.development provisions of the Zoning Ordinance; and
Will not significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of other land C.in the vicinity.
3.20.3 PROVISIONS SHALL BE MADE MANDATORY
In the event that the adopted development plan for an area in which any development is proposed so recommends, the City Council shall require that all petitions for reclassifications of land within the area shall be formulated and administered in accordance with this article, including any amendments thereto. As appropriate for their respective areas, adopted development plans shall also contain recommendations which may differ from or supplement the provisions of this article respecting new or modified PUD districts; design standards for signage, setbacks, parking, and other matters, to be made applicable either area  wide or within particular PUD districts, or both; density credit or bonus systems linked to setback and open space requirements; or any other matter affecting public health, safety, or welfare.

April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
3-50 City of Columbia
3.20.4 RELATION OF PUD REGULATIONS TO OTHER REGULATIONS
The PUD regulations in this ordinance shall apply generally to the initiation and A.regulation of all PUD districts. Where there are conflicts between the special PUD regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements, the PUD regulations shall apply in PUD Districts unless the City Council shall find, in the particular case that provisions herein do not serve public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements.
Where actions, designs, or solutions proposed by the applicant are not literally in accord B.with applicable PUD or general regulations, but the City Council makes a finding in the particular case that public purposes are satisfied to an equivalent or greater degree, the Council may make specific modification of the regulations in the particular case, provided that where floor area and similar ratios (other than off  street parking) have been established by these regulations, the Council shall not act in a particular case to modify such ratios.
Except as indicated above, notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in C.effect, procedures and requirements set forth herein and in guides and standards officially adopted as part of regulations for particular classes of PUD Districts shall apply in PUD Districts, to any amendments creating such districts, and to issuance of all required permits therein.
3.20.5 COMBINATION OF SEPARATE TYPES OF PUDS
The Planning Commission and the City Council may consider separate types of PUDs (such as residential and commercial PUD) within a consolidated master plan as a single administrative procedure provided the total tract is under the unified control of a landholder and the land area is sufficient to comply with separate area requirements combined. This provision in no way alters any requirements in this article.
3.20.6 STAGING OF DEVELOPMENT
The Planning Commission may elect to permit the staging of development, in which case, the following provisions shall apply:
In a residential PUD, the ratio of gross floor area of commercial activity to residential A.activity in the plan as initially approved or amended shall not be exceeded at any given stage of construction.
Each stage shall be so planned and so related to existing surroundings and available B.facilities and services that failure to proceed with subsequent stages will not have an adverse impact on the PUD or its surroundings.
The commencement of actual construction of any stage of the PUD shall be governed by C.the provisions of Sec. 3.20.13.
In the instance of a combined PUD involving residential as well as commercial or D.industrial uses, the Planning Commission may permit the commercial and industrial uses to be constructed first, but only if it findsand records its findings on the final development planthat the nonresidential uses are consistent with current development plans even if no residential construction takes place.
3.20.7 DEVELOPMENTAL CONTROLS AND DIVISION OF LAND
No tract of land may receive final approval as a PUD unless such tract is under the A.unified control of a landholder as defined by this ordinance. Unless otherwise provided as a condition of approval of a PUD, the landholder of an approved PUD may divide and

Arttiiclle 4.. NONCONFORMITIES
SEC. 4.1 GENERAL
4.1.1 PURPOSE
Zoning regulations established by the adoption of this ordinance or amendments to this ordinance may cause properties and uses which were lawful prior to the adoption of certain regulation to not meet requirements after adoption of the regulations. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures and regulations for the use of those properties or structures which are in conflict with the requirements of this ordinance. It is not the intent of this section to encourage the continuance of nonconformities that are out of character with the standards of the zoning district. It is the intent of this section, however, to allow certain nonconforming situations to continue as legal exceptions to this ordinance.
4.1.2 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all nonconformities as defined below.
4.1.3 NONCONFORMITIES DEFINED
A nonconformity shall be any lot, use, improvement, or structure that, as a result of amendments to this ordinance or a preexisting condition, does not meet the current standards of the ordinance.
Nonconforming Lot A.
A nonconforming lot shall be any legally established parcel that does not conform to the current area or dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
Nonconforming Use B.
A nonconforming use shall be any land use or type of residential use that was legally established but has become a prohibited use in the district in which it exists.
Nonconforming Improvement or Structure C.
A nonconforming improvement or structure shall be any legally established improvement, building or structure that fails to meet current ordinance standards for setback, height, or similar factors.
Structures or Uses Located Within the Floodplain D.
Buildings and other structures located within the floodplain are considered within the regulation of nonconforming uses.
4.1.4 BUILDING OR USE PERMIT APPROVED PRIOR TO ORDINANCE ADOPTION
Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans, A.construction, size or designated use of any development, building, structure, or part thereof where official approvals and required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this ordinance or any subsequent amendments, provided that all construction shall be:
In conformance with the approved plans; 1.
Started prior to the effective date of this ordinance and completed within the six-2.month period following the issuance of the certificate or permit; and
Not discontinued until completion except for reasons beyond the builders control. 3.

4.2.1 GENERAL STANDARDS
The creation of a lot with a width or area smaller than allowed by existing zoning A.requirements is prohibited, except by governmental action such as Right-of-Way acquisition or roadway widening.
Notwithstanding this prohibition, the creation of a lot that does not meet ordinance B.requirements is allowed where such lot is comprised of one or more legal nonconforming lots that are being enlarged to create a lot that more closely meets ordinance standards.
Where governmental action has reduced the size of a lot, construction, reconstruction, C.and additions to structures on the lot shall be considered under the standards for nonconforming lots set forth in this subsection.

continuous months, then the land or building or other structure shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use. Intent to resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing provision.
4.3.4 CONTINUATION OF CONDITIONAL USE, VARIANCE, OR EXCEPTION
Whenever any use has been permitted as a conditional use, variance, or exception under the provisions of Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance and has not been made conforming by the adoption of this Ordinance, such authorization may be continued subject to the time of approval of said variance, exception, or conditional use, including any time period established for the continuation of such use.

4.4.3 Special Provisions Governing Nonconforming Structures and Improvements Within
Floodplain Districts
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 4-5
Commentary (Taken from existing Ordinance): For example, a noncomplying building on a zone lot of 3,500 square feet which before conversion required a lot area of 5,000 square feet and was, therefore, deficient by 1,500 square feet, can be converted into any combination of dwelling units requiring a lot area of no more than 5,000 square feet.
4.4.3 SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
General Provisions A.
In all districts or portions thereof which extend into the floodplain districts as established by Sec. 5.1.2A, any building or other structure or use which is not permitted by the floodplain district provisions (Article 9) shall become nonconforming upon the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequent amendment as applicable.
Enlargement of Buildings within the Floodplain B.
A building or other structure which is nonconforming by reason of location within the floodplain shall not be enlarged or expanded but may be altered, or repaired as set forth in Sec. 4.4.1 or as may be expressly authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals in order to incorporate flood  proofing measures provided that such alteration will not increase the level of the 100  year flood or extend the normal life of such nonconforming building or structure.
Special Provisions Governing Reconstruction of Buildings or Structures C.Located Within Floodway Districts (Fwd)
Within any designated floodway district any building or structure in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance that is hereafter destroyed or substantially damaged by any means may be reconstructed and used as before only if the following requirements are met.
No reconstruction or alteration permitted in this Section shall result in any increase 1.in the level of the 100  year flood;
The reconstruction does not exceed the volume and external dimensions of the 2.original structure or does not offer any greater obstruction to the flow of floodwaters than did the original structure;
Non-residential structures may be reconstructed only if the lowest floor (including 3.basement) elevation is at least one foot above the level of the 100  year flood or the structure is flood  proofed (in accordance with the requirements of Article 9) to a height of at least one foot above the level of the 100  year flood; and

These districts are designed to provide suitable areas for manufactured home parks where sufficient urban facilities are available prior to development. Manufactured homes and buildings necessary to support the residential occupancy of these structures are permitted. These districts are intended also to permit community facilities and public utility installations which are necessary to service and to service specifically the residents of these districts, or which are benefited by and compatible with a residential environment. SEC. 5.6 COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
5.6.1 GENERAL
The commercial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and other aspects of the general welfare. These goals include, among others, the following:
To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations in proximity to established A.residential areas, for local retail and service trades catering specifically to the recurring shopping needs of the occupants of nearby residences.
To protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against fire, B.explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards, and against offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, and other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare, and other objectionable influences.
To protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against C.congestion, by regulating the intensity of retail and service developments consistent with their marketing functions, by restricting those types of establishments which generate heavy traffic, and by providing for off  street parking and loading facilities.
To provide sufficient and appropriate space, and in particular sufficient area, to meet the D.needs of the areas expected future need for modern, planned commercial floor space, including the need for off  street parking space in areas where a large proportion of customers come by automobile, and to encourage the tendency of commercial establishments to concentrate in integrated, PUDs, to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants.
To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for commercial districts to satisfy E.specific functional needs of the area, and in particular the need for medical services, and the needs of the general public traveling along major thoroughfares.
To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for the mixture of compatible high F.density residential and restricted commercial developments where standards for development will provide protection for the environmental essentials of either.
Article 5 ZONING DISTRICTS Sec. 5.6 Commercial DistrictS
5.6.2 Purpose of Districts
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
5-8 City of Columbia
To provide appropriate locations for transitional uses intervening between commercial G.developments and residential areas, and thereby alleviate the frictions inherent between dissimilar activities.
To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of commercial and H.miscellaneous service activities.
To provide freedom of architectural design, in order to encourage the development of I.more attractive, efficient, and economic building forms, within appropriate standards.
To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in J.accord with a well  considered plan, to promote stability of commercial development, to strengthen the economic base of the area, to protect the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings.
5.6.2 PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS
OCL  Office Commercial Service Limited Districts A.
These districts are designed to provide a transition between more intensive commercial activities occurring along major traffic arteries and residential areas. The office activities are ones which tend to produce relatively low volumes of traffic. The commercial activities are highly restricted so as to maintain compatibility with nearby residential activities. These districts may occur along arterial streets or adjacent to more intensive commercial activities. The bulk regulations are established to provide for maximum compatibility between the commercial uses and nearby residential activities.
CBD  Central Business Districts B.
This district is designed to provide for a wide range of retail, office, amusement and service uses. High intensity of use is permitted in this district, and increased building bulk is permitted as a means of encouraging such development. A setting conducive to, and safe for, a significant volume of pedestrian traffic is desired in order to promote a high level of contact with ultimate consumers of goods and services.
ISD  Interstate Service Districts C.
These districts are designed to provide adequate space along Interstate highways and other major traffic arteries to serve the needs of the motoring public. Automobile and other vehicular service establishments, transient sleeping accommodations, and eating and drinking establishments primarily characterize these districts. Appropriate locations for these districts are along Interstates and major traffic arteries in an environment of general commercial activity. Due to the high traffic volumes and general incompatibility between the uses permitted within these districts and residential activities they shall not be located in residential areas.
CSO  Commercial Service Office Districts D.
These districts are designed to provide for uses to serve the recurring household needs and personal service requirements of the occupants of nearby residential areas. The permitted commercial functions are those which provide for regular local shopping and which, therefore, are frequented by customers. In addition to the commercial activities, certain office activities are permitted. These districts are characteristically small and widely distributed throughout the community for convenient accessibility. The bulk regulations are established to provide for maximum compatibility between the activities permitted in these districts and adjacent residential activity. The establishment of a new district of this nature must be preceded by the development of residential areas capable of supporting the activities proposed.

5.6.2 Purpose of Districts
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 5-9
MCD  Mixed Use Commercial Service Districts E.
These districts are designed primarily to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for establishments and uses engaged in wholesale trade, warehousing of a wide variety of products or materials, manufacturing processes having the highest performance standards and the least objectionable characteristics, and services ancillary thereto. As these districts tend to generate relatively large volumes of heavy vehicular traffic and have other characteristics detrimental to residential environments, their locations are removed from the proximity of Residential districts insofar as possible. Where these districts must necessarily abut residential areas, requirements designed to lessen incompatible features of commercial development are stipulated. In addition, a selection of consumer retail trade establishments, consumer service uses, and community facilities and utilities, considered necessary to service the principal uses in these districts or necessary for the general community welfare, are permitted.
MRC  Mixed-Use Residential Commercial Service Districts F.
These districts are designed to provide adequate space in appropriate locations for high intensity office uses intermixed with high density residential and limited retail service functions. Characteristics of permitted residential developments are buildings designed for multiple dwelling units, or designed to be attached with party walls. Commercial development, having a minimum of characteristics objectionable in a high density residential environment, is permitted. In addition, use of buildings and land is permitted for community facilities and utilities necessary for serving these districts or for general community welfare. This class of district is appropriately located between districts characterized by lower density residential development and areas of more intensive commercial use, or as nodes along major traffic arteries.
GCS  General Commercial Service Districts G.
These districts are designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services; amusement and entertainment establishments; automotive and vehicular service establishments; eating and drinking places, financial institutions; and offices. The uses in this district service a wide market area and, therefore, ease of automotive access is a requirement. It is not intended that this district permit uses which generate large volumes of truck traffic. Appropriate open space between commercial and residential areas is required.

SEC. 5.7 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
5.7.1 GENERAL PURPOSES OF INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
The industrial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and other aspects of the general welfare. These goals include, among others, the following specific purposes:
To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the area for all A.types of distributive, industrial, and related activities, with due allowance for the need for choice of suitable sites.
To protect distributive, industrial, and related activities, as well as residential and related B.activities by providing for the separation of these uses, and as far as possible, assure that appropriate space needs for distributive and industrial activities are available by prohibiting the use of such space for residential purposes.
To encourage industrial development which is free from danger of fire, explosions, toxic C.or noxious matter, radiation, smoke, dust or other particulate matter, and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare, and other objectionable influences, by permitting such development areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances, without regard to the industrial products and processes involved.
To protect adjacent residential and commercial areas, and to protect the labor force in D.other establishments engaged in less offensive types of industrial and related activities, by restricting those industrial activities which involve danger of fire, explosions, toxic or noxious matter, radiation, smoke, dust, or other particulate matter, and other hazards or create offensive noise, vibration, heat, humidity, glare, and other objectionable influences, by permitting such development in areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances, without regard to the industrial products or processes involved.
To protect industrial activities and related developments against congestion, as far as is E.possible and appropriate in each area, by limiting the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another, and by requiring space off public ways for parking and loading facilities associated with such activities.
To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development, to F.promote stability of industrial and related development, to strengthen the economic base of the area, to protect the character of these districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings, and to protect the communitys tax revenues.
5.7.2 DISTRICT INTENT
IR, Restrictive Industrial Districts A.
This class of district is intended to provide space for a wide range of industrial and related uses which conform to a high level of performance criteria and have the least objectionable characteristics. It is required that all operations of such establishments be carried on within completely enclosed buildings thus providing a standard of development which removes most adverse characteristics that affect neighboring properties. These districts may provide a buffer between other districts and other industrial activities which have more objectionable influences. New residential activities are excluded, and community facilities and commercial establishments which provide needed services for industry and are complementary thereto are permitted.

IG, General Industrial Districts B.
This class of district is intended to provide space for the types of industrial activities which by reason of volume of raw materials or freight, scale of operation, type of structures required, or other similar characteristics require locations relatively well segregated from non  industrial uses. New residential establishments and community facilities which provide needed services for industry and are complementary thereto are permitted.
IS, Special Industrial Districts C.
This class of district is intended to provide suitable areas for intense or potentially noxious industrial operations, including open land operations. It is specifically intended that all newly created districts be so located as to prevent possible negative impact upon adjoining uses. To this end, these districts are to be protected from encroachment by other activities.

6.2.6 LOT TYPE, WIDTH, AND DEPTH
Lot Type A.
Within the City, the various types of lots shall be classified as shown in the graphic below:
Lot Line Equivalent B.
The following provisions shall apply in the determination of a lot line equivalent.
A front lot line equivalent is a straight 1.line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. In the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, the foremost point of a side lot line shall be assumed to be the point at which the side and the front lot line would have met without such rounding.
A rear lot line equivalent is a straight 2.line joining the rearmost points of the side lot lines.
A side lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the ends of the front yard line 3.and the rear yard line on the same side of the zone lot.

Lot Width C.
Lot width shall be measured by the distance between the side lot lines (generally 1.running perpendicular to a street), measured at the point of the street yard along a straight line parallel to the front of the property line or to the chord of the front property line.
Width between side lot lines at their foremost points (where they intersect with 2.street line) shall not be less than 80% of the minimum required width for the district except in the case of lots on the turning circle of cul  de  sacs, where lot widths may be 50% of district requirements. Commentary: In the graphic below, the measurement for lot width is indicated by the W
Lot Depth D.
Depth of a lot shall be considered to be the distance between the midpoints of straight lines connecting the foremost points of the side lot lines in the rear. Commentary: In the graphic above, the measurement for lot depth is indicated by the D
6.2.7 LOT AREA
Lot area refers to the entire horizontal land area of a zone lot, measured in gross square feet. The minimum development area requirements may require a lot larger than the minimum lot area required.

City of Columbia 6-11
6.2.8 DEVELOPMENT AREA PER DWELLING UNIT (DENSITY) Commentary: This includes residential development in nonresidential districts and mixed-use projects.
Density refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land area. For residential development, density is determined by dividing the total area (in acres) of the zone lot by the development area per dwelling or rooming unit. The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor, shall the inability of a development to achieve the stated maximum density be considered sufficient justification for varying or otherwise adjusting other density or dimensional requirements.
Adjustment for Lot Area Remainder A.
In all districts where residential uses are permitted, if an amount of lot area not allocated to a dwelling unit is less than that required for one such dwelling, the remaining lot area may be used to satisfy lot area requirements if it represents not less than 3/4 of the total area required for a dwelling unit. However, the project shall comply with all other applicable regulations including access, setbacks, and yards.
Density Transfer B.
In any instance where a particular development is located in more than one district the density shall be separately computed for each district and no density may be transferred between districts.
6.2.9 YARDS
General A.
Every part of every required yard shall be open and unobstructed from 30 inches 1.above the general ground level of the graded lot upward to the sky except as permitted in Sec. 6.2.9D.
Except as may be expressly permitted as part of a Planned Unit Development 2.(Article 7), no part of a required yard may be included as part of a yard for any other building.
Yards or lots in existence prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall not be 3.reduced below the minimum dimensions required by this Ordinance unless specifically exempted by 6.2.9E, Shallow Interior Lots or Article 4, Nonconformities.
Types of Yards B.
There are three types of yards  street, side, and rear. 1.Commentary: The term street yard replaces the front yard terminology used in many ordinances. Street yards are any yards between the lot line and a street. This works for both regular lots and corner lots.
Corner lots and through lots shall be considered to have two street yards. 2.Commentary: The images below address almost all potential situations. (1) In the image to the left, the house is located on a corner lot with a standard yard (left of the house) and a rear yard (behind the house). The house has 2 street yards (in front of the house and to the right of the house). (2) In the image to the right, the house is located on a through lot. This house is considered to have two street lots (in front and behind the house). The house has 2 standard side yards (to the left and right of the house).

Measurement of Yards C.
The depth of a required street yard shall be measured at right angles to a straight 1.line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The foremost point of the side lot lines, in the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, shall be assumed to be the point at which the side and front lot lines would have met without such rounding.
Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard 2.established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side lot line.
One side yard may equal the required Single Side Yard dimension. However, 3.both yards added together may not be less than the required Total Side Yard dimension. Commentary: In order to promote design flexibility to accommodate individual site characteristics, a split side yard measurement approach has been used. Rather than having two minimum side yards this approach has a total side yard dimension that must be met, but allows for one side yard to be smaller than the other. This allows a structures location to be shifted while still providing adequate protection to adjacent properties.
Permitted Obstruction in Required Yards D.
In all districts, the following shall not be considered obstructions when located within a required yard, except that these items shall not be permitted to violate the provisions of Sec. 6.1.3, Clear Site Triangle.
In any Required Yard: 1.
a. Plantings and vegetation.
b. Arbor and trellises.
c. Awnings or canopies projecting from a building wall up to six feet, provided that the awning has no supports other than provided by the wall or its integral part.
d. Chimneys projecting not more than three feet into and not exceeding two percent of the area, of the required yard.
e. Directional signs may be installed in conformance with the Sign Ordinance.
f. Driveways that meet the requirements of this ordinance.

g. Eaves, gutters, or downspouts, that project into the required yard no more than 24 inches or 20% of the required depth, whichever is less.
h. Fire escapes or staircases that project no more than three feet into the required yard. Risers shall be at least 50% open and the fire escape or staircase may not occupy more than 20% of the required yard.
i. Flagpoles having only one structural ground member.
j. Fountains.
k. Mailboxes.
l. Open terraces, including natural plant landscaping.
m. Project boundary buffers (See Sec. 11.2.7)
n. Sculpture or other similar objects of art.
o. Sidewalks
p. Street buffers (See Sec. 11.2.6)
q. Street furniture such as, but not limited to benches, drinking fountains, trash receptacles, ash trays, light standards.
r. Retaining walls no more than six feet in height.
s. Signage, subject to provisions of the Sign Ordinance of Columbia.
In any Required Side or Rear Yard: 2.
a. Clothes poles or clothes lines associated with residential uses.
b. Recreational equipment.
c. Air conditioning units extending into the required yard no more than three feet or 1/2 the required depth of the yard, whichever is less.
Rear Yard Exception for Shallow Interior Lots E.
Subject to the following, existing interior lots may be permitted a reduction in required rear yard depth.
Applicability 1.
In order to be considered for a reduction, the subject lot shall be:
a. Located on the interior of a zoning district (not abutting another zoning district).
b. Owned separately and individually from all other tracts of land, both on the effective date of this ordinance and on the date of application for a Zoning Permit.
Standards 2.
a. On any interior lots measuring between 80 and 100 feet in depth, the required rear yard shall be reduced by an amount equal to 100 feet minus the depth of the interior lot. However, in no case shall this reduction in the required rear yard depth exceed ten feet. Commentary: For example, if an interior lot is only 95 feet deep, the required rear yard can be reduced by five feet, or 100 ft.  95 ft. However, if an interior lot is only 80 feet deep, the required rear yard can only be reduced by ten feet.
b. Within all nonresidential districts, interior lots measuring less than 80 feet in depth may be permitted to reduce the required rear yard depth to zero. However, if any rear yard is provided, the minimum required depth shall be ten feet.

d. No more than three consecutive, adjacent homes may be permitted to have a front-loaded garage.
6.3.6 NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL
These standards are intended to accommodate limited neighborhood-scale commercial (nonresidential) development that is designed to serve the surrounding community. Larger-scaled commercial development that serves a broader region should be located within zoning districts appropriate to that nature of use.
Applicability A.
Unless specifically exempted in this ordinance, these standards shall apply to all permitted nonresidential uses and development in a Residential district. At a minimum, the following shall be exempt from these requirements:
All agricultural and extractive uses; 1.
All public and civic uses; 2.
Bed and breakfast inns and residences; 3.

A minimum separation of 600 feet shall be required from any street with a 1.classification of arterial or higher.
Where permitted, new nonresidential development shall be located on a street with 2.a classification of major collector.
Unless adjacent to an existing nonresidential use that meets the requirements of 3.paragraph 2 above, no new nonresidential development may be located on an interior lot.
Article 6 DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS Sec. 6.3 Residential District Standards
6.3.6 Neighborhood Commercial
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
6-16 City of Columbia
In order to encourage pedestrian activity and discourage continuous strips of 4.commercial development, location at an intersection with existing nonresidential development shall be preferred.
To further encourage pedestrian activity and interest, buildings shall be positioned 5.so that the street facades are drawn up to the edge of the sidewalk.
Unless a location adjacent to or at the same intersection as an existing property 6.using the Neighborhood Commercial standards is proposed, a minimum separation of 2,500 feet shall exist between existing and proposed uses.
The applicant may propose an alternative location for consideration during the 7.Conditional Use Permit process.

a. No more than two separate buildings or structures shall be permitted within one consolidated development.
b. No single consolidated development shall have more than 12,500 square feet of total enclosed floor area.
c. The largest single tenant in the consolidated development may occupy up to 7,500 square feet of total enclosed floor area.
d. No remaining tenant may exceed 2,000 square feet of total enclosed floor area. Commentary: This standard places a limit on the maximum size of a nonresidential development. For example, a development might have a variety of uses: a modest neighborhood food shop, a coffee shop, and a dry cleaner.
Individual Development 2.
For purposes of this Section, an individual development shall be a project that is limited to one tenant located on one lot. An individual development may not have more than 1,500 square feet of total enclosed floor area or less than 500 square feet of total enclosed floor area.

Sec. 6.3 Residential District Standards Article 6 DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
6.3.7 Types of Residential Development
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 6-17
This requirement may be increased or decreased during the Conditional Use Permit 2.process.
Access H.
When located in or near a residential neighborhood, pedestrian access should be 1.located on the front of a structure and should be given priority over vehicular access. Sidewalks should have a minimum width of six feet and bicycle parking facilities should be located near entrances.
Dual entrances to establishments are encouraged, allowing pedestrian access to the 2.front of an establishment and access to a parking area through another entrance.
On new developments, only secondary vehicle access may be on a minor 3.residential street. Primary vehicle access shall be from the collector street. This requirement may be waived with a finding by the City Engineer that traffic generated shall not have a significant impact on local residential traffic.
Conduct of Operations I.
No outdoor display, service, or storage shall be permitted. All sales, service, or 1.display in connection with commercial establishments shall be within completely enclosed buildings, and there shall be outside such buildings.

Gates or doors to the waste facility storage area shall be completely opaque and self-closing.
6.3.7 TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Development within the Residential districts allows a variety of building types. Two types of subdivisions are permitted, as follows:
Conventional Development A.
Conventional development is a pattern of residential development that provides the majority of property owners with substantial yards on their own property.
Alternative Development (Clustering) B.
Alternative development is a pattern of residential development that allows for smaller yards on individual properties in exchange for the preservation of larger amounts of open space. See 6.3.9, Alternative Development, for these standards.
6.3.8 CONVENTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Conventional development in any Residential district shall meet the development standards as set forth below.

(2) See Sec. 6.3.8A.2, Height Controls Within RM-2 Districts
(3) Increased street yard depth may be required. See 6.3.8B.6, Minimum Street Yard.
(4) Within the R/RS-40 District open space on individual lots may be counted towards the total required provided the open space is protected under a permanent conservation easement.
(5) Projects under 25 acres or 100 units may not be required to dedicate open space. See 6.3.8C.
(6) Open space shall be provided at the rate of 250 s.f. per site or 7% of the gross area, whichever is greater.
Height A.
General 1.
In addition to the dimensional standards found in the table above, the general height standards found in Sec. 6.2.3 shall apply.
Height Controls within RM-2 Districts 2.
Development within the RM-2 districts shall comply with the additional height standards listed below:
Sec. 6.3 Residential District Standards Article 6 DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
6.3.8 Conventional Development
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 6-19
a. Any portion of a building or structure exceeding 30 feet in height shall require a horizontal setback from the edge of the street yard of two feet for every three feet of additional building height.
b. Any portion of a building or structure exceeding 30 feet in height shall require a horizontal setback from the edge of the side and rear yards of one foot for every two feet of additional building height.
c. Portions of buildings set back more than 40 feet from the edge of all required yards may extend to the maximum height indicated in the table above, provided total lot coverage does not exceed 40%.
X = Horizontal Setback Required
Y = Additional Building Height
REQUIRED YARD = Required Street, Side, or Rear Yard, as applicable
Yards B.
In addition to the dimensional standards found in the table above and other requirements of this section, the general yard standards found in Sec. 6.2.9 shall apply.
Permitted Obstructions 1.

Parking in Required Yards 2.
In Residential districts where parking in the street yard is permitted, only one street yard of a corner lot may have parking.
Blocks with Mixed Housing Types 3.
Where housing types are mixed on the same block face and adjacent to one another, the larger of the two adjoining required side yards shall be required for both units.
Commentary: This ensures that single-family detached homes abutting other housing types, such as townhouses or zero lot line units, are adequately protected.
Fronting on a Side Lot Line 4.
Any building with a primary entrance or building facade not fronting on a street shall require side yard at least 1/2 the minimum required street yard depth for the district between the entrance and the side lot line.
Zone Lots of Unusual Shape 5.
In all Residential districts, wherever a zone lot is of such unusual shape that the yard provisions of these regulations cannot be specifically applied, the Zoning Administrator may substitute special yard requirements for such lot only to the extent that these regulations are inapplicable and not to exceed the average of the yard requirements on adjacent lots in the district.
Minimum Street Yard 6.
Within the RM-1 and RM-2 districts:
a. Any improvement on a zone lot shall extend no closer to the street which abuts the designated street yard than the average of the distances of the buildings located within 100 feet on each side of the subject lot; provided that no building shall be required to provide a street yard of greater than twice the minimum required street yard for the district.
b. The minimum street yard requirement shall not prohibit alterations or additions to an existing structure which has nonconforming front walls provided said alteration or addition does not increase the amount of nonconformity.
c. The Board of Appeals may modify this requirement to the minimum extent necessary where strict application would create an undue hardship.

Open Space C.Commentary: In order to prevent the possibility of ending up with random leftover slivers of land and the inefficient provision of open space, projects not meeting the threshold requirements below are not required to dedicate open space.
The standards of Sec. 12.7, Open Space shall apply to all required open space. 1.
All manufactured home park subdivisions, regardless of size, shall provide open 2.space in accordance with the percentages listed in the table above.
All other residential projects less than 25 acres in size and/or 100 dwelling units 3.(whichever is less) shall be exempt from the open space requirements of this ordinance.
Cumulative Impacts 4.Commentary: This subsection is to capture phased or separate developments that may, when taken in part fall under the thresholds, but taken in whole will meet the threshold.
a. For purposes of this section, the thresholds will be the cumulative size and/or number of units for projects that:
(1) Share features such as site access or other roadways, design elements, or other infrastructure with nearby unbuilt, but reasonably foreseeable developments; and
(2) When complete, will function in conjunction with such nearby developments as a single project, the impact of which would exceed the thresholds for the provision of open space.
Standard Minimum Separation between Buildings D.
In general, the minimum required separation between a building which has 1.windows facing another building shall be as follows:
Faces are the two longest planes of a building, or any exterior plane of a building that is 40 feet in length or greater
End is any exterior plane of a building that is not a face, as defined above.

6.3.9 Alternative Development (Clustering)
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
6-22 City of Columbia
6.3.9 ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT (CLUSTERING)
These provisions are intended to provide for variations in lot size and open space requirements within the Residential districts.
Planning Commission Approval Required A.
Alternative developments shall require Site Development Plan (Sec. 3.5) approval by the Planning Commission. In its review, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:
The preservation and protection of existing trees, ground cover, top soil, streams, 1.rock outcroppings and scenic or historic sites from dangers and damage caused by excessive and poorly planned grading of streets and building sites;
The provisions for surface drainage control, sewage disposal, water supply, 2.recreation and traffic control;
The protection of the character, property values, privacy and other characteristics 3.of the surrounding neighborhood;
Generally all public utilities, specifically including water and a central sewage 4.collection and treatment system shall be available. Where public sewer is not available, no lot or housing site may be created which is less than 20,000 square feet in area and all septic fields for each dwelling unit shall be located within the area of fee simple ownership of said dwelling unit; and
The standards found in this Section. 5.
Permitted Uses B.
Generally, only one-family and two-family residential uses may be permitted in an 1.alternative development. Multifamily and manufactured homes may not be permitted in an alternative development.
Up to 10% of the total site may be townhouse units, however all townhouses shall 2.be located on the interior of a site.
Minimum Development Size C.
Alternative development standards may only be used for projects of 10 or more dwelling units.
Permitted Net Density D.
The aggregate density permitted is intended to be within the range of that allowable within a Conventional Development offering no common open space. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be computed as follows:
From the gross acreage available within the development site shall be subtracted: 1.
a. Any portion of the site which is within the right  of  way and/or easement for major utilities such as gas or electric transmission lines; and
b. Any portion of the site which lies within a floodway district.
The area remaining after the above adjustments shall be divided by the minimum 2.development area per dwelling unit for the base district. For developments located in more than one zoning district the density shall be computed separately for portion of the development lying within each district. No developmental density may be transferred across zoning district boundaries.

Yard and Buffer Requirements F.
Within any development approved under the provisions of this section the following yard requirements shall apply:
Units located entirely within the interior of a site shall have no minimum yard 1.depth requirements. However, each dwelling unit shall on its own lot have one yard containing not less than 400 square feet with a minimum horizontal dimension of 15 feet. This yard shall be reasonably secluded from view from streets and from neighboring property and shall not be used for off  street parking or for any accessory building. This yard shall not count towards required open space.
All lots located along the perimeter of a site shall comply with the Conventional 2.Development yard and buffer provisions for the base district.
Building Spacing G.
All detached structures within an alternative development shall be separated by a minimum of ten feet.

6.3.11 CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION OVERLAY AND STANDARD
Intent A.
These standards are intended to conserve significant Conservation Lands (see Sections 6.3.11.Q and 6.3.11.S) and maintain the rural character of the City of Columbia and surrounding areas, consistent with the goals and policies contained in the Maury County General Plan, and in a manner that respects the equity of landowners and the ability of developers to subdivide land at the density normally permitted in the underlying zoning district. It accomplishes this objective through the application of conservation design principles in new subdivisions.
In conformance with the Maury County General Plan and with State of Tennessee enabling legislation, the purposes of this section also includes:
1. To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains and wetlands, by setting them aside from development;
2. To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, site grading, and the amount of paving required for residential development;
3. To reduce erosion and sedimentation by retention of existing vegetation, and minimization of development on steep slopes;
4. To provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups;
5. To implement adopted City policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands;

April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
6-28 City of Columbia
D. Bulk Standards
Within this defined area, the overlay district establishes standards for all residential development. These standards are drawn from the Development Strategies found in the Maury County General Plan.
1. Planned Unit Developments (PUD), or RS-40 zoning, or conservation subdivision design standards are to be used for new residential community developments.
2. Clustered residential development will occur in accordance with conservation design principals to preserve significant amounts of open space.
3. New development will be encouraged to connect to public sewer, and where sewer connection is possible allow the greatest possible lot size reductions within density neutral conservation subdivision development.
4. Roadway alterations will be designed to improve safety conditions and minimize negative impacts on scenic and environmental resources.
5. Impervious surfaces will be minimized by using environmental best practices and sustainable technologies wherever possible.
6. Impacts of new development on the environment, specifically the negative impacts of clear cutting and mass grading, will be limited to the smallest extent possible.
7. New and existing neighborhoods will be connected to greenways and/or trails wherever possible.
8. Water quality with appropriate soil erosion controls and groundwater recharge protection area measures, including Best Management Practices (BMP), will be implemented where available and will be in compliance with the requirements of the Stormwater Ordinance, #3735, and the Aquatic Buffer Ordinance, #3736.
9. Buffers will be established between new housing developments and existing neighborhoods. Buffers can be considered towards meeting the open space requirements for a conservation subdivision and can serve as passive recreation corridors for trails/greenways.
10. When the maximum density is two units per acre, property owners and/or developers will be encouraged to consider design standards that would result in the property being developed for RS-40, PUD or conservation subdivision.
11. In addition to the required review and approval of plans by the Grants and Planning Department, all construction plans will require review and approval of the City Engineering Department.
The remainder of this section of the Zoning Ordinance is written to give further standards for conservation subdivision development.
E. Planning Commission Approval Required

Conditional Use Permit Required (C) 3.
AC indicates that a use is only allowed where approved as a special exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 3.14.

Not Permitted (Blank Cell) 4.
A blank cell in the use table indicates that a use is not allowed in the respective district.
Notes 5.
The Notes column on the use table is a cross-reference to the applicable limited use standards in Sec. 8.3.
Principally Permitted Uses B.
Characteristics, principal uses, and associated accessory uses of the various Use 1.Classifications are found in Sec. 8.2.
Accessory Uses and Activities C.
Standards for select accessory structures and uses are established in Sec. 8.4. 1.
No accessory use may be established on a site without a principal use. The 2.Zoning Administrator may be permitted to grant an exception to this rule subject to the requirements of Sec. 3.7, Administrative Adjustment.
Temporary Uses and Activities D.
Standards for select temporary uses are established in Sec. 8.5. 1.
All temporary uses shall require a Temporary Use Permit pursuant to the 2.procedure established in Sec. 3.8.
Article 8 USE REGULATIONS April 16, 2018 Administrative Draft 8-2 Uses Not Specifically Listed E.
Any use not specifically set forth in this Article is expressly prohibited, unless 1.the Zoning Administrator determines in accordance with Sec. 3.7 Administrative Adjustment, that the use is similar to a permitted use as set forth in this Article. Where such similar permitted use is subject to any limited use standard contained in Sec. 8.3, or conditional use review, the proposed use shall also be subject to such regulation or approval. The Zoning Administrator shall not amend these regulations by adding to or eliminating any use regulation for the proposed use.
Determination of the appropriate group for a proposed principal use not currently 2.listed shall be made by the Zoning Administrator by applying the following criteria.
a. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each group of uses.
b. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity.
c. Relative amounts of sales from each activity.
d. The customer type for each activity.
e. The relative number of employees in each activity.
f. Hours of operation.
g. Building and site arrangement.
h. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.
i. The relative number of vehicle trips generated.
j. Signs.
k. How the use is advertised.
l. The likely impact on surrounding properties.
m. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.
Where a use is not expressly listed as permitted in one district, and that use is 3.specifically listed as permitted in another district in this Article, such use shall be prohibited in the district under consideration and the Zoning Administrator shall have no authority to consider it to be a similar use.
Where a use not listed in this Article is found by the Zoning Administrator not to 4.be similar to any other use in a district use table, the use shall be permitted only following a zoning ordinance amendment in accordance with Sec. 3.17, and such a decision shall not be appealed to the Board of Appeals.
Classification of Combination of Principal Activities F.
The following rules shall apply where a single zone lot contains activities which resemble two or more different principle uses and which are not classified as accessory activities.
Sec. 8.1 Use Table Article 8.1.1 Use Table Key
Zoning Ordinance Administrative Draft City of Columbia When all principal uses of a development fall within one group of uses, the 1.entire development shall be assigned to that group.
When the principal uses of a development fall within different groupings of use, 2.each principal use shall be classified in the applicable group and each use shall be subject to all applicable regulations for that group of uses.
A development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the use table 3.shall be reviewed using the most restrictive process from among the proposed uses. Commentary: If a proposed development includes a convenience store, fuel sales and a restaurant, including outparcels, and one of those uses is only permitted has a conditional use in the district, then the entire development requires conditional use approval.
Where a use requiring approval as a conditional use lies on a separate legal 4.parcel, only the building containing the use and its separate parcel shall be subject to review, not the entire project. However, where the separate legal parcel is an outparcel, the conditional use request shall describe the relationship of the outparcel to the remaining site. Commentary: For example, where a vehicle repair shop is an outparcel within a larger retail development, the conditional use shall review the outparcel only  not the entire development. However, where a conditional use is proposed in a building that contains a variety of other uses, the entire building and its associated parcel(s) of land shall require conditional use review.

The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in Sections 13-7-201 through 13-7-210; Tennessee Code Annotated delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Columbia, Tennessee Mayor and City Council, does ordain as follows:
9.1.2 FINDINGS OF FACT
1. The Columbia Mayor and its Legislative Body wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the requirements of 60.3 of the Federal Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-04 Edition).
2. Areas of Columbia are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
9.1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Ordinance is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

9.1.11 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD WITH ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND WITH FLOODWAYS DESIGNATED
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 9.1.6 B, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction, substantial improvements or other developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not result in ANY increase the water surface elevation of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.

(2) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with Section 9.1.10 B.
9.1.13 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS OR FLOODWAYS (A ZONES)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 9.1.6 B, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A Zones), OR where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 9.1.6, then the Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Section 9.1.10. ONLY if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2 & 3) shall apply:
(2) No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(3) In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Section 9.1.10 B, and Elevated Buildings".
9.1.14 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO AND AH ZONES)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 9.1.6 B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (l'-3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM),

The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be flood proofed and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at least one (1) foot above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be flood proofed to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in Section 9.1.7 B, 9.1.7C and 9.1.8.
(3) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(4) The Administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest adjacent grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
9.1.15 STANDARDS FOR AREAS PROTECTED BY FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM (A-99 ZONES)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 9.1.6B. Are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Sections 9.1.7 and 9.1.10A shall apply.
9.1.16 STANDARDS FOR UNMAPPED STREAMS
Located within Columbia, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the following provisions shall apply:
(1) In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality.

(5) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
B. Conditions for Variances
(1) Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief
necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Ordinances.
(3) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
(4) The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be provided to the Zoning Administrator and made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
Agreement for Shared Parking E.
A shared parking plan shall be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. The owner of the shared parking area shall enter into a written agreement with the City with enforcement running to the City providing that the land comprising the parking area shall never be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building which the parking area serves so long as the facilities are required; and that the owner agrees to bear the expense of recording the agreement and such agreement shall bind his or her heirs, successors, and assigns. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for recordation in a form established by the Office of the City Attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided on-site in accordance with the off-street parking schedules in this Section. The written agreement shall be voided by the City if other off-street facilities are provided in accord with these zoning regulations.
Change in Use F.
Where the uses subject to a shared parking agreement change, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to require a revised shared parking study and a new shared parking agreement when the revised shared parking study indicates additional parking is required.
10.2.11 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS Commentary: Parking areas shall be designed with careful regard given to orderly arrangement, topography, amenity of view, ease of access, and as an integral part of the overall site design. For reasons of use and appearance, it is desirable that parking areas be level or on terraces formed with the slope of the land. Changes in level between such terraces should be formed by retaining wall or landscaped banks. Efforts shall be made to assure
Sec. 10.2 Parking Article 10 PARKING AND LOADING
10.2.12 Parking Facility Design Standards

that a parking area does not dominate a site or building. Such efforts may include depressing the level of the parking area, construction of earth berms, dividing large lots into smaller sub  lots, and other similar techniques.
Use of Compact Spaces A.
Up to 10% of the off-street parking spaces may be sized and designated for compact vehicles, by right; and up to 20% may be allowed by the Board of Appeals. Compact parking spaces shall be accommodated throughout the parking area and appropriately marked. No more than ten compact spaces shall be located in any given row of parking.
Location of Parking B.Commentary: Where possible, parking should be located to the rear or side of the principle structures. A reduction of the amount of parking between the street and the buildings will improve the appearance of the site and road corridor and enhance pedestrian mobility.
No off-street parking may be located in required street buffers or project boundary buffers. 1.
No off-street parking facility or other vehicular use area shall be located over a drainage 2.field or septic system.
In Residential districts where parking in the street yard is permitted, only one street yard of 3.a corner lot may have parking.
Marking of Spaces C.
Nonresidential parking spaces and multifamily parking spaces shall be striped on pavement or designated with some other form of permanent marking.
Storage Area D.

The storage area cannot be located any closer to a right of way than the front of the 3.principle structure and in the case of a corner lot. Any closer to the right of way than the side of the principal structure.
Landscaping material shall be required along any storage area boundary that is visible from 4.a public right of way. Landscaping material shall be a minimum of five (5) feeet tall and be maintained at the height of at least five (5) feet in order to block visibility of the storage area. Landscaping shall be permanently maintained by the owner of the preoperty and replaced if damaged by weather, meglect or any other occurrence. Example: 4,000 sqft. of parking area would allow 1,000 sqft. of storage area to be unpaved.
10.2.12 PARKING FACILITY DESIGN STANDARDS
Each required off-street parking space shall open directly onto an aisle or driveway which is designed to provide safe and efficient access to each parking space. Parking shall not be allowed to impede traffic movement on alleys or streets or to impede pedestrian or bicycle activities.
Dimensions A.
A required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and 19 feet in length 1.exclusive of any access drives, aisles, or columns; however, for nonresidential uses, parking spaces of a reduced size may be permanently designated, by signs, for compact vehicles.

Arttiiclle 11.. LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND TREE
PROTECTION
SEC. 11.1 GENERAL COMMENTARY: There are three basic types of landscaping that may be required for any project. They include (1) project boundary buffers, (2) street buffers (which may include project boundary buffers or vehicular use area landscaping) and (3) vehicular use area landscaping. Each is further described below.
11.1.1 PURPOSE
In order to minimize negative effects between adjacent uses and zoning districts, this Section requires that landscaped buffers be provided for certain uses. The separation of land uses and the provision of landscaping along public and private rights-of-way through a required buffer is designed to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances, and to enhance community image and roadway beautification. Such nuisances may include dirt, litter, noise, lights, signs, unsightly buildings and structures, off-street loading and refuse areas, or parking areas. In addition, buffers provide spacing and landscaping to reduce potentially adverse impacts of noise, odor or lighting. Landscaping shall be coordinated with all site design elements including building layout, parking, access and signs.
11.1.2 APPLICABILITY
Landscaping and buffers shall be provided as set out in these zoning regulations. Buildings and A.structures lawfully existing as of October 5, 2006 may be modernized, altered, or repaired without providing or modifying landscaping and buffers in conformance with this Section, provided there is no increase in floor area in such building or structure or impervious area on the site. This shall not be construed as prohibiting the provision of landscaping or buffers in full conformance with these zoning regulations.
Where a building or structure existed as of October 5, 2006 and such building is enlarged in floor area B.or impervious area on the site by ten percent or 2,000 square feet, whichever is less, landscaping and buffers as specified in this Section shall be provided.
The regulations herein set out for landscaping and buffers shall not apply to one- or two-family C.dwellings on a single lot or parcel, temporary uses, or to development or site alterations on relatively undeveloped sites which do not involve significant ground disturbance.
The required buffers, as specified in these regulations, are minimum standards. The amount of land D.and type and amount of planting or other screening specified for each buffer requirement are designed to mitigate nuisances or incompatibility between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road, and have been calculated to ensure that they do, in fact, function as "buffers." In those instances where these regulations specify different buffering requirements (e.g., a different type of buffer), then the more restrictive specific provisions shall govern.
None of the provisions of these regulations shall be construed as prohibiting additional plant material, E.screening and/or buffer area above that required by these regulations; or prohibiting the modification of existing landscaped buffers to perform to an equivalent degree as the buffer required by these regulations.

11.1.3 Design of Landscaping and Buffers
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
11-2 City of Columbia
11.1.3 DESIGN OF LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERS
Existing Vegetation A.
General 1.
The retention of existing vegetation shall be maximized within the proposed landscaping, parking and buffer areas. When retaining existing vegetation within the buffer area, only clearing methods that do not disturb the root structure shall be allowed within the dripline of tree canopies. Existing native habitat or plant material located within the proposed landscaping or buffer area that meets the requirements of these regulations may be counted toward the total buffer required between adjacent land uses, or toward total landscaping requirements. If the existing vegetation has been counted toward the total required buffer or landscaping and is subsequently removed or dies, it shall be replaced with the appropriate buffer or landscaping material.
Heritage Trees 2.
a. For purposes of this ordinance, a heritage tree shall be any tree species included in the Canopy Trees planting table (see Sec. 11.1.3F.1) with a trunk caliper measurement of 24 or greater.
b. With the exception of clearing required for required driveways, the retention of heritage trees within a proposed landscaping or buffer area shall be required. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to permit the selective removal of heritage trees on a case by case basis.
c. The preservation of heritage trees located on the interior of the lot is encouraged, but shall not be required.
Credit for Existing Vegetation 3.
In order to encourage the preservation of established vegetation, credit shall be given for preservation within the proposed buffer or other required landscaping areas (see Sec. 11.2.8, Credit for Existing Buffer). In limited cases, the applicant may be permitted to count established vegetation located outside of the required planting area towards the landscaping requirement.
Design, Installation and Establishment Standards B.
Location of plants and design of landscaping, including maintenance, shall be according to sound landscape and horticultural principles. The use of native vegetation and other lower maintenance landscape materials is desired to promote environmental protection, energy efficiency, and water conservation.
Landscape plans submitted for approval for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of 1.this Section shall clearly indicate the name, location, and size of vegetation to be installed as well as trees to be preserved.
Plant material should be chosen from the lists of recommended plant species contained 2.within this Section, and shall adhere to the minimum specifications therein. Plant materials shall be reviewed for suitability with regard to the eventual size and spread, susceptibility to diseases and pests, and appropriateness to existing soil, climate and site conditions.
Plant Material and Minimum Plant Size C.
The following lists of plant materials shall be used as a guideline to define the required plant unit. Although the lists may be expanded, they are intended to provide guidance in selecting predominately hardy natural species. All materials shall be of high-quality nursery grade.
Cold Hardy and Drought Tolerant Plants D.
Required trees and shrubs shall be cold hardy for the specific location where they are to be planted. Trees and shrubs shall be drought tolerant and able to survive on natural rainfall once established with no loss of health.

Soils E.
All landscaped areas shall have uncompacted coarse loam that is a minimum of 12 inches deep. Soils shall be appreciably free of gravel, stones, rubble or trash. All compacted soil, contaminated soil or roadbase fill shall be removed. Under no circumstances shall soils with greater than 5% or less than 0.5% organic matter be accepted.
Required Plant Species F.
The following list shall be used as a guide in identifying and categorizing the different acceptable types and minimum sizes for any required plant. Plants identified in the guide, Native Plants of the Tennessee Valley, published by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) shall be acceptable as well.

Minimum Planting Areas G.
Canopy trees shall have a planting area no less than 10 feet wide in all dimensions. Accent and substitution trees shall have a planting area no less than eight feet wide in all dimensions. This requirement may be modified administratively by the Zoning Administrator.
Mulch H.
Plants shall be mulched a minimum of three inches deep. Where selected plant material is not tolerant of deep mulch, a specific note regarding shallower mulch shall be set forth on the final landscape plan and approved by the City as part of the landscape plan. Mulch shall be kept away from tree trunks.
Foundation Planting I.Commentary: Foundation planting should enhance and highlight building architecture. The use of foundation plantings is particularly important on blank walls (i.e. to window or door openings).
Foundation plantings are intended to soften building edges and screen foundations. Where specified, building foundation planting shall meet the following requirements:
Required foundation planting shall be in addition 1.to other required site landscaping.
Foundation plantings shall be placed within five 2.feet of the building perimeter. If the Zoning Administrator determines that, due to site design considerations such as the location of sidewalks, plazas or service areas, this is not feasible, such plant materials may be located in planter boxes or

11.2.1 Buffer Defined
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 11-5
in the areas of the site in a manner that enhances the overall landscape plan for the development.
Ten shrubs shall be required for every one hundred linear feet of building perimeter for 3.nonresidential uses. SEC. 11.2 REQUIRED BUFFERS
11.2.1 BUFFER DEFINED
A buffer is a specified land area, located parallel to and within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line, together with the planting and landscaping required on the land. A buffer may also contain, or be required to contain, a barrier such as a berm, fence or wall, or combination thereof, where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various land use activities. A buffer is not intended to be commensurate with the term "yard" or the term "stormwater management area."
11.2.2 TYPES OF REQUIRED BUFFERS
There are two types of required buffers that may occur on any given development site, as follows.
Street buffers; and A.Commentary: Generally, a street buffer is located along the street(s) that border a development. The buffer requires a modest amount of landscaping, enhancing the public environment.
Project boundary buffers. B.Commentary: Generally, a project boundary buffer is located around the sides and rear of a development. This buffer ensures an appropriate transition between uses.
11.2.3 LOCATION
Buffers shall be located within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, parallel to and extending to the A.lot or parcel boundary line. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street or right-of-way.
Buffers may be constructed in any required yard. B.
11.2.4 PLANTING IN EASEMENTS
No trees shall be planted in wet retention ponds or drainage maintenance easements. A.
Trees and shrubs shall be installed at least five feet away from the flow line of a drainage facility B.unless specifically designed as water quality measures adhering to best management practices.
Existing trees may remain in dry retention ponds provided that the natural grade is undisturbed to the C.tree line, they are a species adapted to seasonal flooding and the pond is adequately maintained.
Accent trees and shrubs listed above shall be allowed in access easements, provided a minimum 20-D.foot wide travelway is maintained clear of vegetation, and all clear sight triangles are met.
Trees may be planted in easements for underground utilities with City approval, provided the root E.structure of the proposed tree is not anticipated to extend more than three feet below the ground. Shrubs may be planted, provided they are only within the outer three feet of the easement. Where such trees and shrubs are planted, the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of such required vegetation if maintenance or other utility requirements require their temporary removal.
A minimum buffer width of five feet, or at least half the minimum required buffer width, shall be F.provided outside of any required easements. The majority of buffer plantings and all structures shall be located outside the easements.
11.2.5 DETERMINATION OF BUFFER REQUIREMENTS
To determine the type of buffer required between two adjacent lots or parcels, or between a lot or parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:
Article 11 LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND TREE PROTECTION Sec. 11.2 Required Buffers
11.2.6 Street Buffers
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
11-6 City of Columbia
Street Buffers A.
Determine the appropriate street buffer based on Section 11.2.6.
Project Boundary Buffers B.
Identify the zoning districts of the subject parcel and all adjacent properties. Determine the buffer opacity class required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel. Refer to the minimum project boundary buffer table in Section 11.2.7.
Design Variations (Buffer Width Averaging) C.
While the buffer depth is normally calculated as parallel to the property line, design variations are allowed and are calculated on the average depth of the buffer per 100 feet or portion thereof. Minimum depth of buffer in any case shall not be less than one-half the required depth of the buffer chosen, or less than five feet, whichever is greater. Maximum depth for the purposes of installing required landscaping, or receiving credit for existing vegetation, shall not be more than one and one-half times the required depth of the buffer chosen.
Multi-Tenant Expansion and Redevelopment D.
Any expansion or redevelopment of a multi-tenant development shall be required to provide a percentage of the required project boundary buffer, and a percentage of the required street buffer, including any required parking buffer, when improvements are made that trigger the provisions of this Section. This percentage shall equal the total gross leasable area of the proposed expansion or redevelopment, divided by the total gross leasable area of the entire existing multi-tenant development (including the proposed expansion or redevelopment).
11.2.6 STREET BUFFERS
The following types of street buffers shall be required. No vegetation or fence shall interfere with a required clear sight triangle at a driveway or intersection (See Sec. 6.1.3). Berms constructed in accordance with Section 11.2.9B are encouraged as a component of any street buffer.
Arterial or Collector Street Buffers A.
All development located along either an arterial or a collector street shall be required to provide one of the following buffers along the entire street frontage.
Three canopy trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a ten-foot 1.landscape buffer; OR
Two canopy trees and two accent trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located 2.within a ten-foot landscape buffer; OR
Under utility lines only, four accent trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located 3.within a ten-foot landscape buffer. No trees under utility lines shall have a natural height over 25 feet.
Arterial or collector street buffers may average ten feet in width provided that no portion of 4.the street buffer shall be less than five feet in width.
Local Street Buffers B.
With the exception of one- or two-family dwellings on a single lot or parcel, all development across a local street from a Residential district or use shall require a buffer with a minimum opacity of .1 (see 11.2.7A) and a minimum width of six feet.
Measurements C.
Required driveways may penetrate required street buffers. 1.
Driveway widths (measured at the inside edge of the buffer) shall not be counted in the 2.calculation of the plant material required.
All buffers shall be measured from the future right-of-way line determined during site and 3.development plan review.
Sec. 11.2 Required Buffers Article 11 LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, AND TREE PROTECTION
11.2.7 Project Boundary Buffers
Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 11-7
Vehicular access easements shall not be treated as a street, but shall be buffered as a project 4.boundary buffer outside the easement area. The buffer may be provided on either side of the easement.
Additional measurement methodologies related to buffer depth and height are found in 5.Section 11.2.5C, Buffer Width Averaging.
11.2.7 PROJECT BOUNDARY BUFFERS Commentary: Project Boundary Buffers ensure a landscaped transition between different types of uses and/or zoning districts. At first glance, the following method may seem complicated. In reality, this is a fairly easy approach to implement. A few simple steps will provide the total amount of plants that are required to be in a buffer as well as the buffer width. This approach also addresses the following criticisms that are raised when a city requires buffers and landscaping. 1. What about unusual site circumstances? The table provides a number of alternative approaches to achieving the requirements. 2. Why do I have to put all the plants in- the lot next to me is vacant? This approach anticipates this type of situation. The initial developer will have a reduced buffer requirement. 3. What if I want to put in a narrower buffer? The developer may select Alternative 3, Canopy and Wall. This will allow the developer to reduce the buffer width while still providing appropriate screening. 4. There are already plants there- why do I have to put in new plants? Credit is given for existing plants (that meet a minimum size requirement) on a one-for-one basis.
Required Project Boundary Buffer Table A.COMMENTARY: The requirements for project boundary buffers may create a tree canopy that is too thick to support the accent trees and shrubs below it over time. This crowding out of understory is anticipated to occur, and has been taken into account in the requirements for these buffers. The intent is to achieve an immediate buffering effect based on the smaller species, and a long-term effect based on growth of the canopy trees.
The buffer standards in the table below address the opacity of the buffer that is required on 1.the property boundary between zoning districts, and in some instances within a zoning district.
An opacity of 0.1 screens ten percent of an object, and an opacity of 1.0 would fully screen 2.the adjacent development during summer months after five years of growth.
How to Read the Buffer Table 3.
a. The required opacity of project boundary buffers is represented in the Table below by two numbers (for example, .3/.5).
b. The second number represents the total required buffer opacity between any two properties.
c. Where the proposed project is located adjacent to vacant property, the first number represents the projects required buffer opacity.
d. Where the adjacent property is already developed with no buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the total required opacity (the second number).
e. Where the adjacent property is already developed with a partial buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the remaining opacity required.
f. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.

COMMENTARY: A .1/.3 requires a 10 percent opaque buffer for property adjacent to vacant land or a 30 percent opaque buffer when adjacent to existing development. . A .3/.3 requires a 30 percent opaque buffer property adjacent to either vacant or developed land. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required. EXAMPLE: A new development in the GCS District abutting a developed RM-1 District would be required to provide a buffer with an opacity of .8 (80% opaque) If the adjacent RM-1 property were vacant, the requirement would be .6 since the adjacent property is vacant.

The placement of required plants and landscape structures shall be the decision of each user, except that the following requirements shall be satisfied:
Although this Section does not generally specify the location or spacing of required plant material, all A.plant materials shall be installed to achieve the purposes for which that planting is required. This means that plant materials shall be located so as to achieve the maximum level of protection to the less intense zoning district or use. Unless otherwise required by these regulations, such as in the case of a hedge, the required planting should generally be in an irregular line and spaced (or grouped) at random. Plant material shall meet the buffer requirements every 100 feet.
Canopy trees shall be located no closer than five feet from any structure. Other trees and shrubs shall B.be planted no closer than three feet from any structure. Where vines are planted, the minimum distance shall be two feet. Trees, shrubs and vines planted in constrained buffers shall be exempt from this requirement.
All trees adjacent to utility lines shall conform to any City requirements for tree setbacks. For further C.information, consult the publication Trees to Plant Under Powerlines produced by the University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension.
Where a separate legal parcel is permitted for stormwater management, it shall be included as part of a D.common development plan. The following buffer shall be required:

SEC. 12.1 LARGE SCALE COMMERCIAL
12.1.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this Section is to supplement development standards elsewhere in these zoning A.regulations with specific criteria that apply to the design of certain commercial buildings and projects,
The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design B.of certain commercial buildings and sites determines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the community. Massive, duplicative or generic projects that do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.
The Citys goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by C.providing for architectural and site design treatments that will enhance the visual appearance of certain commercial development and the quality of life.
This Section incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, D.landscaping, lighting and sign treatments located elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this Section is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.
This Section is also intended to: E.
Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, 1.aesthetically pleasing structures;
Encourage landowners, designers and developers to look closely at local conditions and the 2.development site, and produce new development that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment;
Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with 3.the existing and proposed character of the area, including residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract from the positive elements existing neighborhood characteristics.

Zoning Ordinance August 2005 April 16, 2018
City of Columbia 15-1
Arttiiclle 15.. SIGN REGULATIONS
WHEREAS, the specifications set forth in these sign regulations are designed to address aesthetic and traffic safety concerns for the benefit of the public health, safety and welfare, while allowing the use of signs as a medium for conveying messages; and
WHEREAS, left unregulated, the height, sign face area, number and location of signs can result in visual clutter, confusion for drivers, and interference with efforts to establish a desirable community identity; and
WHEREAS, Context-Sensitive Signage Design, a publication of the American Planning Association (2001), encourages the development of good sign regulations for both aesthetic and economic purposes, providing as follows:
Successful urban design involves the encouragement of projects that can enhance the physical setting. Streetscape enhancements, including landscaping, street furnishings, public art, and signage, can be powerful in establishing a sense of place. . . . Taking a holistic approach to all aspects of the built environment results in a place that many people can benefit from in tangible ways. When a place feels like it has been cared for, people enjoy spending time there, and purchasing goods and services. By the same token, businesses feel comfortable investing in such a location. In this sense, the issues of urban design in general and sign design in particular are not just aesthetic, but economic as well.
The enhancement of pedestrian environments, the creation of attractive gateways, and the strengthening of the overall economic vitality and image of the community are all helped by adopting a good set of sign regulations.
WHEREAS, the City of Columbia has recently experienced a great deal of development and growth and seeks to manage continued development and growth in an attractive manner; and
WHEREAS, in establishing parameters for height, area, number, location and other physical attributes of signs, the City of Columbia has examined the regulations of other cities which have been looked upon as examples of aesthetic quality and has sought input and assistance from area business persons, the Maury Alliance, and the sign industry; and conducted public hearings; and
WHEREAS, visual comparisons of areas where signs have been uncontrolled to those in areas where signs have been controlled show the obvious advantages and aesthetic benefits of good sign regulations.
April 16, 2018 August 2005 Zoning Ordinance
15-2 City of Columbia
WHEREAS, the City has created a new Interstate Zoning District, and finds it desirable to regulate signage at the newly created zone in a manner separate from the remaining zoning districts in the City so as to provide for larger signs in that zone while still protecting the aesthetics of the City;
WHEREAS, for the reasons stated heretofore, it is desirable to revise the Citys sign regulations and reduce the allowable height, size and number of signs within the City, and to allow for larger signs only in the newly created Interstate Zoning District, in the interest of pursuing aesthetic quality and relative uniformity of signs within the City.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF COLUMBIA ,AS FOLLOWS:
SIGN REGULATIONS
Sec. 15.1 Findings, purpose and effect.
15.1.1 Findings. The Columbia City Council hereby finds as follows:
(a) Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment.
(b) Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages.
(c) Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare. Shorter, smaller signs are less likely to create aesthetic concerns, traffic hazards, and detriments to property values.
(d) The city's regulations regulate signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within cities have had positive impacts on traffic safety and the appearance of the communities.

(c) Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees.
(d) Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set forth herein under the regulatory authority of the city.
15.1.3 Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations, applicable building and electrical codes, and other provisions of the municipal code.

(c) Provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances.

Subdivision Regulations
ARTICLE 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS
1-1 Title
These regulations shall hereinafter be known and cited as the Subdivision Regulations of
Columbia, Tennessee.
1-2 Authority and Legal Status
These Subdivision Regulations are adopted, and shall be amended, by the Columbia
Regional Planning Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Planning Commission), in
pursuance of the authority and powers granted by Section 13-3-101 through 13-3-413,
and Section 13-4-101 through 13-4-310, Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA). Having
adopted a major street or road plan for the jurisdictional area, and filed a certified copy
with the Maury County Register of Deeds (hereinafter referred to as "County Register")
as required by TCA 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, and having held a public hearing as required
by TCA 13-3-403 and 13-4-303, the Planning Commission has fulfilled the requirements
set forth in state law as prerequisites to the adoption of these regulations.
The following standards guiding the Planning Commission are designed to provide for the
harmonious development of the City; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate
provision for traffic; and to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation,
transportation, water drainage, sewerage and other facilities.
Compliance Officer. It shall be the duty of the Columbia City Engineer (hereinafter
referred to as the Compliance Officer) or his/her designee to enforce these regulations
and to bring to the attention of legal counsel any violations or lack of compliance
herewith.
Discrepancy With Other Regulations. No subdivision of land within the force and effect of
these regulations shall be approved unless it conforms to the Zoning Ordinance.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted
herein and those contained in the Zoning Ordinance, building codes, or other regulations,
the highest standard shall apply.
Validity. If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these Subdivision
Regulations shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, paragraph, provision
or portion of these regulations.
1-3 Jurisdiction
These Subdivision Regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the jurisdiction
of the City of Columbia as defined by the Columbia Planning Commission. No land shall
be subdivided within the jurisdictional area until the subdivider submits a plat as required
by these regulations, obtains Planning Commission approval of the plat, and files the
approved plat with the County Register.
1-4 Policy and Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land
has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of
defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public
responsibility, in that streets must be maintained and various public services must be
provided. The public health, safety and welfare is thereby affected in many important
respects; therefore it is in the interest of the public, the developer, and the future owners
that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with the
ordinances and regulations governing the subdivision of land within the City of Columbia
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 1-2
Subdivision Regulations
(hereinafter referred to as the City), and the Comprehensive Plan.
1-5 Interpretation, Conflict and Severability
1-5.1 Public Provisions
These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of
these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher standards shall govern.
1-5.2 Private Provisions
These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction; provided, that where these regulations are more restrictive or
impose higher standards than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement or
restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where any private provision exceeds the standards set forth herein, such shall be
considered a private contract between the parties of interest, and, as such, is beyond the
jurisdiction of the Planning Commission.
1-5.3 Severability
If any part or provision of these regulations or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment
shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in
the controversy where such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or
impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application thereof to other
persons or circumstances. The Planning Commission hereby declares that it would have
enacted the remainder of these regulations without any such part, provision, or
application.
1-6 Saving Provision
These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under or by
virtue of previous Subdivision Regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or
altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person,
or as waiving any right of the governing body under any section or provision existing at
the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained
by any person by lawful action of the governing body, except as expressly shall be
provided otherwise in these regulations.
1-7 Previously Approved Preliminary Plats
1-7.1 Unexpired Preliminary Plats
The approval granted on any preliminary plat prior to the effective date of these
regulations shall remain in force and effect for the time period of one year.
1-7.2 Expired Preliminary Plats
If the applicant does not file and record a final plat application within one year, the
preliminary plat approval is considered expired and the process must be repeated unless
the applicant, through written request, is granted an extension from the Planning
Commission. Expired plats are considered null and void; new plans shall be subject to all
laws and provisions of these regulations that are in effect at the time such action is
considered. In making the determination for extension, the Planning Commission shall
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 1-3
Subdivision Regulations
consult the City Engineer on determining if the development is in continual pursuit of
construction completion.
1-8 Amendments
1-8.1 Enactment
For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general welfare the Planning
Commission may from time to time amend these regulations. Before adoption of any amendment
to these regulations, a public hearing thereon shall be held by the Planning Commission, as
required by Title 13, Chapters 3 and 4, Tennessee Code Annotated.
1-8.2 Codification and Distribution
Subsequent to adoption of any amendment to these regulations, such amendment shall
be incorporated into the text of these regulations in the following manner:
1) Replacement pages shall be prepared incorporating the new or changed language.
Each such new or replacement page shall have the amendment number and shall be
dated so as to indicate the date of last revision of the page.
2) Each adopted amendment shall be numbered consecutively and printed on pages
separate from any other amendment and in a manner that fully states any language
deleted from these regulations and any language added and the place in the text of
each such change.
1-9 Resubdivision of Land
1-9.1 Procedures for Resubdivision
If any change in an approved or recorded subdivision plat would affect the layout of any
public street, alley, or road (hereinafter referred to as public way) shown on such plat, or
area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it would affect any map, plan, or
plat legally recorded before adoption of any subdivision regulations, such amendment
shall be approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
1-9.2 Subdivision Procedures Where Future Resubdivision Is Foreseen
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one (1) or more
lots containing more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district
wherein the lot is located, and the City Engineer has reason to believe that any such
lot(s) will be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the City Engineer may require that
the subdivision and development of such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
public ways and the ultimate extension of adjacent public ways or that such lots be
restricted from further subdivision. The City Engineer may also require that dedications
providing for future opening and extension of such public ways be indicated on the plan.
1-10 Conditions
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land
subdivision are exercises of valid police power delegated by the State to the Planning
Commission. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions
imposed by the Planning Commission for design, dedication, improvement, and
restrictive use of the land so as to provide for physical and economical development of
the jurisdictional area and for the safety and general welfare of future plot owners in the
subdivision and of the community at large.
1-11 Vacation of Streets, Easements, or Other Public Facilities
Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time
before sale of any lot described therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 1-4
Subdivision Regulations
plat shall be attached, declaring the plat or part of the plat to be vacated. In approving the
vacation of plats the Planning Commission shall follow the same procedure for approval
of plats. The governing body may reject any such instrument that abridges or destroys
any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, or public ways. Such an
instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or approved, and duly recorded or filed; the
instrument shall operate to void the recorded plat and divest all public rights in the public
ways and public grounds and all dedications described in such plat. When any lot or lots
have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided all of the owners
of all lots in such platted area join in the execution of such writing.
Any dedicated right-of-way shown on a recorded subdivision plat can be abandoned only
through the resubdivision of such plat, or through the resubdivision of the affected section
of such plat, according to the procedures of these regulations. Thereby, the Planning
Commission must approve the resubdivision of the initially recorded plat that depicts the
dedicated right-of-way or future public way access area, in such a manner wherein such
dedicated right-of-way is deleted from said plat. Once this revised plat is officially
recorded, it acts to supersede the originally recorded plat, and accordingly preserve any
existing utility easements, if present. No official action shall be made by the Planning
Commission in relation to the abandonment of any dedicated right of-way, pending public
notification of adjacent property owners by registered mail as to the time and place of the
Planning Commission meeting, at which time such action is to be officially entertained.
Any public way access area or dedicated right-of-way that is abandoned as per the
procedures cited herein shall be deeded solely to the abutters of such public way access
area or dedicated right-of-way.
1-12 Variances
1-12.1 General
If the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may
result from strict compliance with these regulations, a variance from these regulations
may be granted; provided, such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the general
intent and purpose of these regulations and provided, further, that the Planning
Commission shall not recommend variations unless it shall make findings based upon
written evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
1) Granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare,
or be injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood where the
property is located;
2) Conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property
for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other properties
and is not based on financial returns;
3) Because of the particular physical surroundings, natural features, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved, a particular hardship (not self-imposed) to
the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter
of these regulations were carried out; and
4) The variance will not in any manner alter provisions of the General Plan, Land Use
Plan, Transportation Master Plan, or the Zoning Ordinance.
Where the Planning Commission concludes that the purpose of these regulations may be
specifically served to an equal or greater extent by an alternative proposal, condition, or
circumstance, it may approve other variations to these regulations.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 1-5
Subdivision Regulations
1-12.2 Procedures
In approving any variances from these Regulations, the Planning Commission shall state
fully, in the meeting minutes, the grounds for the variance and all of the facts upon which
the decision is made.
1-12.3 Conditions
In approving variances, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions as, in its
judgment, will secure substantially the objectives, standards, and requirements of the
Regulations.
1-13 Enforcement, Violation, and Penalties
1-13.1 General
1-13.101 Recording of Plats
The enforcement of these regulations and the penalties for violations are
provided pursuant to Title 13, Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA).
1-13.102 Recording of Plats
Pursuant to Section 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, TCA, no Final Plat of subdivision
within the jurisdictional area shall be received or recorded by the county register
until such plan has received approval of the Planning Commission in accordance
with these regulations, and such approval has been endorsed in writing on the
plan by the Planning Commission secretary in the manner prescribed by these
regulations.
1-13.103 Use of Unapproved Plats
Pursuant to Section 13-3-410 and 13-4-306, TCA no owner or agent of the owner
of any land shall convey such land contrary to the provisions stated herein.
1-13.104 Public Ways and Utilities
Pursuant to Section 13-3-406 and 13-4-307, TCA, the governing body shall not
nor shall any public authority accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light
any public way, lay or authorize the laying of water mains or sewers, or construct
or authorize the construction of other facilities or utilities in any public way
located within the jurisdictional area unless such way shall have been accepted,
opened, or otherwise received the legal status of a public way prior to the
attachment of the Planning Commission's jurisdiction, or unless such way
corresponds in its location and lines to a way shown on a subdivision plan
approved by the Planning Commission or on a public way plan made by the
Planning Commission.
The governing body may, however, accept or lay out any other street or adopt
any other street location, provided the resolution, ordinance, or other measure for
such acceptance, laying out or adoption first shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for its approval and, if disapproved by the Planning Commission,
shall receive the favorable vote of a majority of the entire membership of the
governing body. A street approved by the Planning Commission upon such
submission or accepted, laid out, or adopted by the Planning Commission shall
have the status of an approved street location as fully as though it originally had
been shown on a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Commission or on a
plat made and adopted by the Planning Commission.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 1-6
Subdivision Regulations
In case, however, of any state highway constructed or to be constructed in the
jurisdictional area by the State of Tennessee with state funds as a part of the
state highway system, the submission to the Planning Commission shall be by
the Tennessee Commissioner of Transportation, who shall have the power to
overrule the disapproval of the Planning Commission.
1-13.105 Building Permits
No building permit shall be issued for construction of any building or structure
located on a lot or plat that is subdivided or sold in violation of any provision of
these regulations. Any individual requesting a building permit for a lot located
within an established subdivision shall provide evidence that the plat of
subdivision wherein such lot is located has been approved and appropriately
recorded.
1-13.106 Access to Lots by Public Way or Private Easement
Pursuant to Section 13-3-411 and 13-4-308, TCA, no building permit shall be
issued and no building or structure shall be erected on any lot within the
jurisdictional area, unless the public way giving access to the lot where on the
building or structure is proposed to be placed shall have been accepted or
opened or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public way prior to
that time or unless such way corresponds in its location and lines with a way
shown on a subdivision plan approved by the Planning Commission, or on a
street plan made and adopted by the commission, or unless such lot fronts upon
a permanent easement that conforms to all rules, regulations and specifications
set forth, herein.
In any instance where a permanent easement is used to provide access to a lot
or tract of land having been or being separated by deed or plan from other
property, such easement shall be at least 50 feet in width and shall not be used
to provide access to more than one lot or tract of land with the exception of flag
lots as stated in Section 4-3.2.
Where a permanent easement is proposed to provide access to more than one
(1) lot or tract of land, an access way shall be constructed within the easement
which will meet or exceed the standards for design and construction of public
ways set forth in these regulations, and the Planning Commission shall act to
insure that the responsibility for future maintenance of any such access way lying
within a permanent easement remains solely with the benefited parties and that
in no event shall the maintenance of such access way become a public
responsibility.
1-13.2 Penalties for Violations
1-13.201 Recording of Unapproved Plats
No County Register shall receive, file, or record a plat of subdivision within the
planning region without approval of the Planning Commission as required in
Section 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, TCA, and any county register so doing shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as provided by law. Any County
Register, receiving, filing or recording a plan of a subdivision in violation of
Section 2-10 (Signing and Recording of Subdivision Plats), of these regulations,
shall be deemed guilty of a violation of the above cited provision of the
Tennessee Code Annotated.
1-13.202 Use of Unapproved Plats
Section 13-3-410 and 13-4-306, TCA, provides that whoever being the owner or
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 1-7
Subdivision Regulations
agent of the owner of any land transfers, or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to
sell such land by reference to, exhibition of or by other use of a plat of
subdivision of such land without having submitted a plat of such subdivision to
the Planning Commission and obtained its approval as required before such plat
be recorded in the office of the appropriate County Register, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided by law.
1-13.203 Unlawful Structures
Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of these subdivision
regulations shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure; and the building
official or other official designated by the local government may bring action or
enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed as provided in Section
13-3-411 and 13-4-308, TCA.
1-13.3 Civil Enforcement
Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken in equity to prevent any violation of
these regulations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages; to restrain,
correct, or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure, or
premise; these remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described in Section 1-13.2,
Penalties for Violations, of these regulations.
1-14 Repeal of Previous Regulations
Upon the adoption and effective date of these regulations, the Subdivision Regulations,
of Columbia, Tennessee, adopted June 1, 1989, as amended, are, hereby, repealed.
1-15 Fees for Plan Review
Any individual who is seeking to subdivide property within the jurisdictional area where
these regulations are applicable shall pay such filing and review fees as are required.
These fees shall be paid prior to the item being placed on an agenda for consideration by
the Planning Commission.

ARTICLE 2: PLAT PREPARATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE
2-1 General Procedure
2-1.1 Plat Approval Requirements
Before any contract is executed for the sale of any parcel of land that is proposed to be

facilitate traffic movement, water distribution, sewer collection, stormwater drainage,
detention, bioretention, conveyance and any other infrastructure within future sections of
a development the Commission may require that such systems be constructed as part of
any section of a subdivision. Each phase of a development needs to be "stand alone" in
regard to utilities, fire protection, streets and stormwater management. Phase lines must
follow reasonable and logical boundaries, such as terminating at intersections or
following topographical breaks and shown clearly on plans. Phases shall be constructed
in the approved manner to ensure orderly and planned development. Phases shall be

ARTICLE 3: ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF
IMPROVEMENTS
3-1 Improvements and Performance Bond
3-1.1 Completion of Improvements
Before a final subdivision plat is signed by the Planning Commission Secretary as
specified in Article 2-10 of these regulations, all applicants shall complete, in accordance
with the Planning Commissions decision and to the satisfaction of the appropriate
governmental representative: all public ways, water, sewer, drainage control and other
improvements as required in these regulations and approved by the Planning
Commission, and shall dedicate such improvements to the governing body free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances on the property. The Planning Commission, at its
discretion, may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public
improvements prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat by providing that the
applicant post a bond at the time of submission for final subdivision approval in an
amount estimated by the Compliance Officer as sufficient to guarantee to the governing
body the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incomplete portion of
required improvements . (See Section 2-7.7)
Performance Bonds shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory
to legal counsel as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution, as set forth in these
regulations. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be
specified by the Planning Commission in the motion approving the final subdivision plat
and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not exceed two (2) years from date of
final approval.
Such bond shall be approved by the Planning Commission as to amount and conditions.
Sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of a bond, if improvements are not complete, the
City Engineer may notify the developer and recommend to the Planning Commision to
extend the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional
year with minimum of ten (10) percent increase or greater if determined by the City
Engineer. Performance Bonds shall provide an automatic renewal, referred to as an
evergreen clause, in the event the developer is not contacted by the Engineering
Department prior to the expiration of the bond.
3-1.2 Performance Bond
For the purpose of these regulations, Performance Bond shall mean two documents: a
Performance Agreement and an accompanying Security Document.
The Performance Agreement shall stipulate a completion date for all of the work to be
performed and that the applicant agrees to have a registered professional landscape
architect, architect and/or engineer, depending on the type of improvements, involved in
the construction phase of the project for the purpose of monitoring construction in order
to determine conformity with approved plans and specifications of the City of Columbia.
The Performance Agreement shall only be entered into by the owner of the property. The
bond shall be in the amount of 125 percent of the actual estimated cost as determined by
the Compliance Officer and based on the recommendations of city departments. The
performance bond shall also secure all lot improvements and private access
improvements required pursuant to these regulations, including necessary off-site
improvements. Bond information for sanitary sewer installation is contained within the
Standard Sewer Specifications for Subdivisions and General System Additions. Please
contact the Director of the city of Columbia Wastewater Department.
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 3-2

Types of Bonds. The security document may be in a form as follows and shall express
the value in a total amount equaling the sum of all work categories. The beneficiary of the
surety shall be the Planning Commission and/or the City.
1) Surety Bond or Performance Bond. Issued by an insurance company licensed in the
State of Tennessee and located within 75 mile radius of Columbia, Tennessee.
2) Irrevocable Letter of Credit. Issued by or confirmed by a financial institution located
within a 75 mile radius of Columbia, Tennessee. Any such credit shall bear an
expiration date that exceeds the expiration date of the Performance Agreement and
contains an automatic renewal referred to as an evergreen clause.
3) Cashiers or Certified Check. Issued by a financial institution located within a 75 mile
radius of Columbia, Tennessee.
The Surety Bond and Letter of Credit options shall not be available to an applicant whose
past performance has resulted in breached or expired bonds. An insurance company
whose past performance has resulted in non-payment of a bond may be excluded from
providing a surety bond for an applicant for a period of one year from the date of breach.
The financial institution shall not issue a surety for more than 10 percent of its total capital
to an applicant.
3-1.3 Temporary Improvements
The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the
Planning Commission, and shall maintain them for the period specified by the Planning
Commission. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, a separate
suitable bond shall be posted which shall ensure that the temporary facilities shall be
properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
3-1.4 Costs of Improvements
All required improvements shall be made by the applicant at the applicant's expense. Any
provisions for reimbursement by the governing body or any utility agency shall be
stipulated in a separate agreement with the applicable City Department or other
governmental entity.
3-1.5 Governmental Units
Governmental agencies to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file, in
lieu of said contract or bond, a certified resolution, or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Article.
3-1.6 Failure to Complete Improvements
In subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are
not completed within the period specified by the Planning Commission in the motion
approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases in
which a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the City Engineer with approval of
the City Attorney may then: 1) declare the agreement to be in default and require that all
the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the development at the time the
bond is declared to be in default; 2) obtain funds under the security and complete
improvements itself or through a third party; 3) exercise any other rights available under
the law.
3-1.7 Acceptance of Dedication Offers

space, and parks shall be by formal action of the governing body. Such action shall be in
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 3-3
Subdivision Regulations
the form of a resolution recommended by the appropriate City Staff or Department to the
City Council. The approval by the Planning Commission, whether sketch, preliminary or
final plat, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply an acceptance by the governing
body of any public way, easement, or other ground shown on the plat. The Planning
Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect.
Wastewater improvements are accepted by the City Council upon recommendation of
Wastewater Director.
3-2 Inspection of Improvements
3-2.1 General Procedures
If the appropriate governmental representative finds upon inspection that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the applicable City
Department's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be
responsible for completing such improvements to the required standards. Whenever the
cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding
company or financial institution shall be liable severally and jointly for completing said
improvements according to specifications.
3-2.2 Inspection Fees
The costs incurred in connection with a request for extension or reduction of the surety or
release of the performance bond and surety (that is, consulting engineering inspection
fees, legal fees, and so forth) shall be borne by the subdivider, regardless of whether the
request is ultimately granted. No bond shall be released until the City Recorder certifies
that all fees have been paid. Inspection fees shall be charged.
3-3 Release, Reduction or Extension of Performance Bond
3-3.1 Certificate of Satisfactory Completion
The Compliance Officer shall not release nor reduce a performance bond until all
applicable Departments or Agencies provide written confirmation that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and all associated and/or surplus
construction materials are removed from the site. There shall be no reduction or release
of a bond if there are any outstanding administrative penalties or violations related to the
bonded site.
3-3.2 Reduction of Performance Bond
A performance bond may be reduced upon demonstration of satisfactory completion of
public improvements, that includes installation of the asphalt surface binder course, and
then only to the ratio that the installed improvement bears to the total public
improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced
below 25 percent or $5,000, whichever is greater of the original principal amount of the
infrastructure within the right-of-ways excluding utility services. No more than two
reductions for any one agency shall be considered by the Compliance Officer. The initial
bond reduction shall be considered only after the asphalt surface binder is applied to the
entire subdivision phase as platted.
3-3.3 Extension of Performance Bonds
The Compliance Officer, upon proof of extenuating circumstances by the applicant and
acknowledged and agreed to by the Planning Commission, may extend the completion
date set forth in such bond and may require an increase in the bonded amount to cover
increases in costs per Section 3-1.1

The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements including all lot
improvements, until acceptance of such public improvements by the appropriate
department.
The applicant may be required to file a maintenance bond with the governing body prior
to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the appropriate governmental
representative and in a form satisfactory to legal counsel in order to assure the
satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all lot improvements, for a
period of one year after the date of acceptances of the public improvements by the
appropriate department.

detention and retention ponds, landscaping, entry features, pavilions, structures, private
streets and facilities to be conveyed to an association of the owners of the lots within the
subdivision shall stipulate maintenance and repair of said land and facilities in the Master
Deed(s), or declaration of covenants. The conveyance shall provide mandatory
membership of all present and future owners and residents within the subdivision, and
shall also provide for a levy against all property within the development for said
maintenance and repair. All such conveyance and covenants shall be stipulated. All such
conveyance and covenants shall be made a part of the subdivision review process and
the content shall be approved by the City Attorney. The Master Deed(s), or declaration of
covenants, shall also provide for a sufficient level of funding to offset the reasonable and
foreseeable costs of maintenance.
3-5 Escrow Deposit for Lot Improvements
3-5.1 Acceptance of Escrow Funds
Whenever, due to season of the year, any lot improvements required by these
regulations cannot be performed, the Compliance Officer nevertheless may issue a
Certificate of Occupancy upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be
determined by the appropriate governmental representative for the cost of such
improvements; provided that there otherwise is no danger to the health, safety, or general
welfare. The performance bond covering such lot requirements shall remain in full force
and effect. Acceptable escrow funds shall be maintained in accounts that are beyond the
reach of the developer.
3-5.2 Procedures on Escrow Funds
All escrows shall be held by the City, kept in its bank accounts, and totally under control
of the City. A detailed Escrow Agreement shall be prepared and appropriately endorsed
by all parties to such agreement at the time of creation of any escrow account. The
developers tax identification shall be used for the escrow and the developer shall be
responsible for paying tax on any interest credited to the escrow account.
All required improvements for which escrow moneys have been accepted by the
Compliance Office at the time of issuance of a certificate of Occupancy shall be installed
by the developer within a period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit and issuance
of the Certificate of Occupancy. In the event that the improvements have not been
installed properly at the end of the time period, the Compliance Officer shall provide
written notice of two (2) weeks to the developer requiring installation. In the event they
are not installed properly, the developer may request the City to proceed to install or to
contract for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the
amount of the escrow deposit.

City of Columbia Page 3-5
Subdivision Regulations
3-6 Issuance of Building Permits and Certifications of Occupancy
1) Where a Performance Bond has been required for a subdivision, or any section of a
subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision or section
therefore shall be issued prior to the completion and dedication of the improvements to
the appropriate governmental unit, as required in the planning commissions final
approval of the subdivision plat.
2) The extent of public way improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access including
emergency vehicles. The developer shall at the time of the dedication submit monies in
escrow to the governing body in a sum to be determined by the appropriate governmental
representative.

Subdivision Regulations
methods to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions are formulated
by the developer and approved by the Planning Commission, upon recommendation of
the City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such
land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve any danger to public health, safety,
and welfare.
4-2.2 Critical Lots
A lot shall be designated critical when the lot is created on a slope of 20 percent or
greater, when it contains floodplain area or on the basis of any other lot feature that
affects the feasibility of construction as listed in Subsection 4-2.
As part of the review process, a star symbol shall be used to clearly identify critical lots
on the face of the Sketch Plan, Preliminary Plan, and Final Plat. Example star symbol:
4-2.3 Prior to Sketch Plan Approval
Prior to approval of a Sketch Plan for a subdivision that includes lots designated as
critical, the applicant shall provide the Engineering Department with a preliminary grading
study and a description of the measures to be taken:
1) To protect the natural features of the critical lots;
2) To minimize changes in grade, cleared area, and volume of cut or fill, and to control
adverse impacts on the critical lots during and following the period of site
disturbance;
3) To align streets to minimize disturbance of slopes; and
4) To identify easements along property lines to meet future drainage needs;
4-2.4 Critical Lot Plan Required
Prior to application for a building permit on a lot designated as critical, a plan shall be
submitted to the Engineering Department for approval.
4-3 Lot Requirements
4-3.1 Lot Arrangement
The lot arrangement shall be such that there shall be no foreseeable difficulties, for
reasons of topography, flood hazards, or other conditions in providing a building site, yard
area and access. Lots proposed for creation on steep slopes, or with limited acceptable
soil for private sewage disposal system (if applicable), shall be designated on the face of
the plat as critical lots in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-2.2.
Where feasible, lot arrangement shall be such that building sites will afford maximum
utilization of energy conservation measures, such as providing for solar access purposes.
4-3.2 Lot Dimensions
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning Ordinance.
Lot Lines. Residential side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or
radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better
street or lot plan.
Frontage. Each lot shall have frontage onto a street or onto a common open
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-4
Subdivision Regulations
space. Lots that front onto a common open space shall have vehicular access
from an abutting public or private alley, a shared driveway easement, or a
frontage street and shall meet all of the following conditions:
a) Vehicular access for dwelling units set back no more than 150 feet from a
public way.
b) Alleys shall be approved by the Engineering Department, Public Works and
Fire Department.
c) Alley shall extend from street to street.
Flag Lots. A residential flag lot that abuts a public street with a narrow street
frontage (flag lot), may be approved by the Planning Director if the following
conditions are met:
a) No more than one lot in a subdivision of less than eight lots shall be a flag
lot. No more than two lots or 10 percent of the total lots in the subdivision,
whichever is greater, shall be flag lots in a subdivision of eight or more lots.
b) A flag lot shall serve only one single-family dwelling and its accessory
buildings and the private drive and/or access easement shall connect to a
street.
c) Minimum width for the flagpole portion of the lot shall be 50 feet with a
private drive of at least 10 feet wide for its entire length.
d) Any occupied building on the flag lot must be within 250 feet of a fire
hydrant. This distance shall be measured along the street, then along the
flagpole portion of the lot, and then in a straight line to the building location.
Alternatively, the City Engineer and Fire Marshal may allow a greater
distance if the structure has an Approved Automatic Sprinkler System.
e) The flag lot shared access easement shall be part of one non-frontage lot
and under the same ownership as that lot.
f) Maximum length for the flagpole portion of the lot shall be 250 feet.
Corner Lots. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for street
intersection radii and for erection of buildings, as stipulated by the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance.
Additional Yard Area. Residential lots, including double frontage and corner lots,
shall be platted so that the depth of any yard abutting an arterial or collector
street, limited access highway or railroad can conform to any additional yard
requirements established by the zone district requirements.
a) In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth adjacent to a
railroad right-of-way or limited access highway may be required for minor
subdivisions and shall be required for major subdivisions. This strip shall be
designated as common open space and shall meet the requirements of
Landscape Buffering and Tree Protection in the Columbia Zoning
Ordinance.
b) In commercial or industrial areas, the nearest street extending parallel or
approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way shall be at a sufficient
distance there from to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial
sites.
4-3.3 Building Setback Lines at Electric Power Lines
Subdivider shall meet the local power distributor, Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) Standard Right-of-Way Widths for transmission lines and National Electric
Safety Code clearances. Right-of-ways shall not be blocked in any manner that
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-5
Subdivision Regulations
would impede ingress and egress In the case of overhead electric power lines
where easement widths are not definitely established, a minimum building
setback line from the center of the electric power line shall be established as
follows:
Voltage of Distribution Line Building Setback
15 kV and under 20 Feet
46 kV 37 1/2 Feet
69 kV 50 Feet
161 kV 75 Feet
4-3.4 Access from Arterial or Collector Streets
When property is divided along an existing street, the Engineering Department may
require that lots not derive access from arterial or collector streets. Where driveway
access from arterial or collector streets is necessary, the City Engineer may require that
lots be served by combined driveways (usually one driveway entrance shared by two
lots), or by a private access drive serving more than two lots (if necessary shared
maintenance arrangements shall be incorporated into the subdivision deeds) in order to
limit driveway entrances and potential traffic hazards.
4-3.5 Grading and Seeding
No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until final grading has been completed and
soil stabilization installed in accordance with the approved construction plan. Grading
should be the minimum necessary to allow for the efficient construction in accordance
with Columbia Zoning Ordinance.
Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be
redistributed so as to provide cover on the lots, cover between any sidewalks and curbs,
and be stabilized by seeding or planting.
4-3.6 Debris and Waste
No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste
materials of any kind shall be buried in any land or left or deposited on any lot or street at
the time of the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any lot. Nor shall any such
waste be left nor deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the
performance bond and/or at the time of dedication of public improvements.
4-3.7 Fencing
Each subdivider or developer shall be required to furnish and install all fences wherever
the Engineering Department determines that a hazardous condition exists. Such fences
shall be constructed according to standards established by the Engineering Department,
as appropriate, and shall be noted on the final plat as to height and required materials.
No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any affected lot until such fence
improvements have been installed.
4-3.8 Lot Drainage
Lots shall be arranged in a manner to permit coordination of lot drainage with the general
storm drainage system for the area, including subsurface drainage.
1) Drainage systems shall be designed to avoid concentration of flow from each lot onto
adjacent lots.
2) The applicant shall insure that all artesian ground waters of a permanent or
temporary nature discovered during the subdivision planning, development and
construction process shall be intercepted and carried away to primary drainage
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-6
Subdivision Regulations
conduits by swale ditches or in underground pipes on property line easements.
Regardless of the location of property lines, intercept shall be allowed at the point of
artesian surfacing. The applicant shall be obligated to perform this work upon
evidence of any artesian water discovered during the planning, development, and
construction phase of the subdivision.
3) Any sinkhole or any natural channel serving as a means of moving ground water into
the subterranean system shall be identified on the final plat and shall be protected as
approved by the Engineering Department and the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation (TDEC). All sinkholes in residential subdivisions shall
be platted as open space.
4-3.9 Relationship to Watercourses
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines may be so
drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the adjacent lots.
1) The Engineering Department may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed
that it shall not become a public responsibility.
2) No more than 10 percent of the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning
Ordinance may be satisfied by land that is under water.
3) Where a watercourse separates a buildable area of a lot from the street by which it
has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other drainage
device of a design approved by the Engineering Department and no building permit
shall be issued for a structure on such lot until the installation is completed and
approved by the Engineering Department.
4-4 Lot Subdivision Connectivity
Each subdivision shall provide at least two different ingress-egress routes for adequate
traffic flow and for safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies. If the
subdivision is unable to have two ingress-egress connections due to limited road frontage
or topography, then the City Engineer along with the Planning Commission may approve
the subdivision with a single ingress-egress route.
The Planning Director may require a subdivision to achieve a connectivity index of 1.2 or
greater. A connectivity index is a ratio of the number of street links (road sections
between intersections and cul-de-sacs) divided by the number of street nodes
(intersections and cul-de-sac heads). Street links on existing adjacent streets that are not
part of the proposed subdivision are not included in the connectivity index calculation.
The measure of connectivity is the number of street links divided by the number of nodes.
Nodes exist at street intersections as well as cul-de-sac heads. Links are the stretches of
road that connect nodes. Stub outs shall also be considered as links.
If a subdivision fails to meet the connectivity index, the Planning Director may determine
that this requirement is impractical due to topography, an existing development, and/or
natural features. In the event road connections are impractical, a minimum six (6) foot
wide pedestrian trail shall be provided to link cul-de-sacs.
4-5 Blocks
4-5.1 Block Widths
Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths.
Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major
streets, railroads, waterways, or for commercial double frontage lots along collector or
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 4-7
Subdivision Regulations
arterial streets.
4-5.2 Block Lengths
Block Lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 200 feet
or 4 lot widths whichever is greater, except as the Planning Director deems necessary to
secure efficient use of land or desired features of the street pattern. Wherever
practicable, blocks along arterial and collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in
length.
4-5.3 Considerations for Block Length, Width, and Shape
The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
Zoning requirements as to lot sizes; Needs for convenient access, circulation, control,
and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and Limitations and opportunities of
topography.
4-5.4 Easements through Blocks
The Planning Director may require the dedication of an easement through blocks to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. To accomplish this
purpose, the Planning Director may require perpetual unobstructed easements at least
twenty (20) feet in width.
4-6 Improvements
4-6.1 Authorization to Construct Improvements
The approval of the Sketch Plat by the Planner Director, and the Preliminary Plat plan by
the Planning Commission, and the approval by the applicable departments or agencies of
construction plans shall be authorization to proceed with construction of improvements
within a subdivision.
4-6.2 Construction of Improvements
Construction shall be completed to the approved construction plans, construction
specifications, and construction inspection requirements of the applicable department
and agencies. Inspections during the construction process shall meet the requirements of
Section 2-8. If construction has not started within 180 calendar days of the approval date
of the construction plans, the City Engineer may require construction plans to be
resubmitted (fees repaid) to the applicable departments or agencies for re-approval. The
State approves sewer plans on a 1 year basis. The developer has to request an
extension from the State if construction has not started within that year.
4-6.3 Completion of Improvements
After all required inspections are completed, the final paving course may be applied when
75 percent, of the structures are completed within a subdivision. Under no circumstances
shall final paving occur until all utility installations, including service lines to lots are
complete. However, when an undue hardship is created by disallowing the final paving of
a street prior to construction of 75 percent build-out, the Columbia Engineering
Department may permit final paving to occur and the Planning Commission may allow the
subsequent reduction of the Performance Bond as described in Article 3: Assurance for
Completion and Maintenance of Improvements. Once 90 percent of all structures within a
subdivision are completed, no further building permits shall be issued until all
infrastructure has been completed and accepted by the applicable departments and
agencies.
4-7 Public Ways
4-7.1 General Requirements
All plans for street improvements require the approval of the Columbia Engineering
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 4-8
Subdivision Regulations
Department.
4-7.2 Street Design Standards
Sight Distance. Sight distance along streets and at intersections shall be not less than the
minimum horizontal and vertical distances as specified in the AASHTO Design Guide
Manual, current edition, for the class of street under consideration.
Grades and Cross-slopes. Maximum grades shall be approved by the Columbia
Engineering Department and current standards.
Vertical Design. Vertical design shall be in accordance with the current edition of the
AASHTO Manual. The vertical design speed of a street shall be equal to or greater than
the horizontal design speed of that street. The applicant shall show on the plans the
parabolic curve (K value) and the design speed of each vertical curve, and the design
speed of each horizontal curve.
Right-of-Way and Pavement Width. Minimum right-of-way width and pavement width
shall meet the Engineering Departments standard details or as approved by the City
Engineer. Whenever possible, four moving lanes should be avoided in residential areas
except for required arterial or collector streets. Four lanes may be warranted for short
distances at entrances to larger developments. One-way streets may be permitted and, in
some cases, may be desirable for loop streets or where there is a need to separate the
directional lanes to preserve natural features or to avoid excessive grading for street
construction on slopes.
Non-Curb Street Design Permitted. A non-curb street design cross section in accordance
with Engineering Department's standard details and specification may be permitted along
low volume roads in a Conservation Subdivision or Low Impact Development.
Horizontal Radius of Curved Streets. The minimum centerline radius of curved segments
shall be in accordance with the AASHTO Manual, current edition. Generally, subdivision
streets shall not be superelevated.
Pavement Standard. Public and private streets shall be designed in accordance with the
standards as set forth by the Columbia Engineering Department
Exposed Utility Casting. Prior to final paving, a manhole, valve box frame and cover, or
other utility casting that is exposed to traffic and requires adjustment to an elevation one
inch or more above the existing pavement shall have a temporary asphalt ramp
constructed uniformly around the casting. A taper slope of not less than two feet per one
inch shall be used. During the final paving operation, the temporary ramp shall be
removed from the casting to allow for the permanent paving installation.
Tangents between Reverse Curves. The minimum length of tangents between reverse
curves for non-superelevated streets shall be in accordance with the Engineering
Department's Standard details and specification.
Turnarounds. The type of turnaround required shall be determined by the Engineering
Department. Turnarounds shall be designed to accommodate emergency and service
vehicles as well as passenger cars. Exceptions to the turnaround requirements may be
made for short streets, up to 150 feet long, where emergency and service vehicles are
able to back out with relative ease. The maximum lengths of streets with turnarounds
shall be 650 feet. All circular turnarounds of 150 feet or greater radius on permanent
dead-end streets shall have a central planting island. The design of turnarounds shall be
approved by the Engineering Department.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-9
Subdivision Regulations
Intersection Design Standards for Minor Local, Local, and Collector Streets.
Intersecting streets shall meet at a 90-degree angle wherever possible. Where natural or
manmade obstacles prevent a standard intersection, intersecting streets may have a
centerline angle of not less than seventy-five (75) degrees. The centerline-to-centerline
distance between offset T-type intersections shall be at least 200 feet along local streets
and 300 feet when such T-type intersections occur along a collector street. The minimum
radius of corner lines (returns) connecting lines of intersecting streets shall be approved
by the Engineering Department. Where a street approach to an intersection is curved,
there shall be a 100-foot minimum curve tangent as measured from the ultimate edge of
pavement. For the purposes of this requirement, the ultimate edge of pavement is that
point to which the pavement will extend when the street is built to its full dimension
conforming to the standards for its assigned classification on the Transportation Master
Plan and Collector Plan. At street intersections, a vertical slope not greater than 3
percent for 50 feet or greater shall be provided on all stopped streets except on minor
local streets an approach slope of 35 feet or greater at a maximum 4 percent grade may
be permitted as measured from the ultimate edge of pavement as defined by the
Transportation Master Plan.
Number of Intersecting Streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect in any one
location unless otherwise specifically approved by the City Engineer.
Design Speeds. For safety purposes, on low volume residential streets, the designer
shall use design features that tend to reduce speed, including narrower widths, shorter
streets, curves and on street parking.
Gated Subdivisions. Guardhouses and gate structures shall be approved by the City
Engineer and shall include a typical system, acceptable to the City Fire Department, for
immediate emergency access to the subdivision. At a minimum, gated subdivisions shall
meet the following requirements:
1) All gates shall be located a minimum of 30 feet from the public right-of-way and shall
not open outward but shall open with the flow of traffic;
2) At least 13 feet 6 inches vertical clearance shall be provided and maintained over
the full width of all means of access; and
3) The clear opening provided through gates shall be 2 feet wider than the traveled
way.
The Columbia Fire Marshal and the City Engineer may impose additional requirements
for gated subdivisions as may be necessary to carry out the intent of these subdivision
regulations. Under no circumstances shall the City or emergency service providers be
responsible for the repair of any damage to the gates or structures associated with an
emergency response into the subdivision.
4-7.3 Reserve Strips
The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed public way in such a manner as to
deny access from adjacent property to such public way may be required by the Planning
Director to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or public ways. A notation to this
effect shall be entered on the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached
thereto.
4-7.4 Additional Regulations for Private Street
Private streets may be included in any subdivision in conformity to these standards so
long as the subdivision is included within a Conservation Subdivision or Traditional
Neighborhood Design as defined in Article 6 of these subdivision regulations. The private
street (or road) shall be identified on the face of the plat as an easement for lot access
and as a public utility easement.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-10
Subdivision Regulations
Private streets shall conform to the provisions of Section 4-7 of these regulations and in
addition the following:
1) All vehicular access to the private street shall be shown on the development plan and
final subdivision plat.
2) The Master Deed(s), or declaration of covenants shall contain, in its description of the
common element(s), a specific designation of the private street as the responsibility
of an Owner's Association and not of the City of Columbia. The Master Deed(s), or
declaration of covenants, shall also provide for a sufficient level of funding to offset
the reasonable and foreseeable costs of maintaining the private street(s).
4-7.5 Street Construction and Related Requirements
Grading and Improvement Plan. Street plans shall conform to the standards required by
this Section and shall be approved as to design and specification by the Engineering
Department.
Improvements in Floodable Areas. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be a
minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood elevation. Location of such streets shall
conform to the requirements of the Stormwater Management Regulations as
administered by the Engineering Department.
Arrangement of Streets:
1) All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of
streets and dedicated rights-of-way as established in the Comprehensive Plan and
Transportation Master Plan.
2) All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators, such as industries,
business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities;
and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
3) Minor local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the
topography, to provide for the efficient dispersal of internal traffic while discouraging
high volumes of through traffic, and to permit efficient drainage and accommodate
utility systems.
4) The use of an interconnected street system shall be used to broadly disperse internal
traffic and provide maximum alternatives for access to property for both public and
private movement.
5) The use of curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where conformance with existing
topography shall minimize the volume of cut and fill.
6) Street designs such as loop streets shown in Figure 1, are preferred to the use of a
cul-de-sac design. Cul-de-sacs shall be permitted where topographic features or
configuration of property boundaries prevent street connections. These alternatives
shall support the turning movements of emergency and service vehicles.
Figure 1
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-11
Subdivision Regulations
7) Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided,
unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, then the
extension is not desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
layout, either in existence or proposed, of adjacent tracts. Where streets are
extended to property lines, temporary turnarounds shall be installed, unless the street
segment is less than 150 feet in length. In all cases, drainage and utility easements
shall be extended to property boundaries.
8) In business and industrial developments, the streets and other access routes shall be
planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the
provision of alleys, truck loading, and maneuvering areas, and location of walks and
parking areas to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic,
including pedestrian traffic.
Dead-end Streets.
1) Dead-end Streets (Temporary). The arrangement of streets shall provide for the
continuation of streets between adjacent properties for convenient movement of
traffic, effective fire protection, and/or efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent
property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the
right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary turnaround, approved
by the Engineering Department, shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets
exceeding 150 feet in length, with a notation on the subdivision plat that land outside
the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the
street is continued. The reconstruction of the temporary turnaround into the normal
right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the attaching developer. Temporary turnarounds
shall have a minimum slope of one percent as measured from the center.
Additionally, a sign shall be placed, in accordance with the requirements of Section 4-
9, at the terminus of the temporary cul-de-sac that reads as follows: "Temporary
Dead-End Street, to be extended by the authority of the City of Columbia,
Tennessee.
2) Dead-end Streets (Permanent). Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary
of the subdivision and continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for
access to adjoining property, the terminus shall normally not be nearer to such
boundary than 20 feet. However, the City Engineer may require the dedication of an
easement extending to the property line to accommodate drainage facilities,
pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A turn-around shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with these regulations. For greater
convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent deadend
streets shall be limited in length in accordance with these regulations.
Alleys. Alleys may be required where appropriate in all commercial and industrial
districts. Alleys are appropriate in residential districts to improve lot access, reduce the
number and frequency of driveways entering public or private streets, or reduce the need
for topographic disturbance.
Bridges. Bridges must meet the latest version of the TDOT Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction. All bridges, including bridges required as part of a
driveway serving a single residential home, shall meet necessary construction standards
to provide access for emergency vehicles. Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider,
as determined by the Planning Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of
the subdivider without reimbursement from the governing body. The sharing of expenses
for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia Page 4-12
Subdivision Regulations
the Planning Commission, shall be fixed by special agreement between the governing
body and the subdivider
Construction Standards. The construction plans of all streets shall be approved by the
Engineering Department.
4-8 Preservation of Natural Features, Amenities or Improvements
4-8.1 Application
Where a proposed subdivision adjoins or encompasses either a Greenway Corridor
shown on any Countywide Greenways Plan and/or Countywide Parks Master Plan, a
substandard street, or a route depicted upon the Transportation Master Plan to be
opened, widened, or realigned, or generates a need for increased recreational
opportunities, then requirements of Section 4-8 shall apply.
4-8.2 Undeveloped Property
Infill Development on Non-Standard Street(s). Infill development, located on streets within
the urban district that is predominantly developed, provide access to primarily residential
uses, and are established with a non-standard right-of-way and/or pavement width,
generally shall not be required to provide right-of-way or pavement width in excess of the
existing street dimensions.
Planned Routing. The layout of a street(s) within a subdivision shall conform to the
routing depicted upon the Transportation Master Plan. The amount of right-of-way for the
type of street required shall be dedicated up to a maximum of 60 feet in width. Where any
street so depicted requires a right-of-way greater than 60 feet then the developer shall
show on the face of the plat an additional area "reserved for future right-of-way" and any
required yard area shall be measured from the reservation line.
4-8.3 Developed Property
When property containing existing structures is being divided simply to place each
structure on a separate lot and the future right-of-way will fall within the existing structure
footprint, then the applicant shall be required to note on the face of the plat any additional
area necessary for compliance with the Transportation Master Plan" reserved for future
right-of-way." The plat shall also contain a note stating, "When any existing structure is
demolished, the setback requirements for any new structure shall be measured from the
reservation line."
4-8.4 Required Improvements or Dedications
In addition to the above requirements, a traffic impact study shall be required in
accordance with Article 2-5 Traffic Impact Study. Any required on- or off-site street
improvements shall be made by the developer upon property that the developer controls
and/or upon public property.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the area as a
whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable
assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision, as required by the Planning
Commission. No change of grade of the land shall be effected nor shall any natural
features be removed or relocated until a preliminary subdivision plat has been approved
by the Planning Commission.
4-8.5 Relationship to Scenic Routes
A subdivision fronting or encompassing a street designated on the Transportation Master
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 4-13
Subdivision Regulations
Plan as a scenic road shall be platted in accordance these Subdivision Regulations and
with the following:
1) Right-of-way shall be platted as noted in Article 4 except for the lot area located
within 75 feet of the centerline of the existing right-of-way shall be designated on the
face of the plat as a "Scenic Easement."
2) A building setback line shall be located on the face of the plat. The line shall be
established by measuring the applicable zone district required yard from the scenic
landscape easement line.
3) A note shall be placed on the face of the plat that states, "except as authorized by the
approved construction plans, no grading, cutting of trees, or disturbance of natural
features shall be performed within this easement except driveway crossings which
shall be located to provide minimal disturbance." The note shall be referenced by
arrow or number to the scenic easement location.
4-8.6 Conservation Easements
Publicly accessible conservation easements may be required in subdivisions along blue
line streams that are contiguous to greenways or natural open space as indicated in the
Comprehensive Plan, City Greenway Plan or other community parks and recreation
plans. In areas where the primary function of the greenway is as an urban or
neighborhood transportation connector and the waterway is not a regulated floodway, the
greenway conservation easement shall include the streambed plus a corridor at least 35
feet in width, measured from top of bank, outward. In areas where the greenway is
intended to protect the natural environment of and public access to the major waterways
in Maury County, and serve the multifunctional roles of recreation, transportation, and
habitat protection, the greenway conservation easement shall include the floodway plus a
corridor at least 75 feet in width, measured from the outer edge of the floodway. In cases
where the maximum cross-slope of the land included in the easement is greater than 15

ARTICLE 5: SUBDIVISION (S) ACCEPTANCE
5-1 Requirements and Procedures for Subdivision Acceptance
At the conclusion of site construction, the following procedures must be followed and all
items outlined herein must be completed and the subdivision must pass a final site
inspection. The City of Columbia departments that have been involved in the
construction oversight process will conduct these inspections.
Construction Inspections. Engineering, Waste Water, CPWS, and Planning office shall
inspect and sign off on all new site improvements and infrastructure during construction.
Applicable state inspections from TDEC (WPC or Division of Water) must be
documented as approved before final City acceptance.
5-2 Final Inspection
Before a subdivision will be accepted or a building Certificate of Occupancy will be
issued, an as-built site plan must be submitted by a fully qualified registrant, licensed in
the State of Tennessee, to certify the site is in substantial compliance with the original
plans issued for construction.
All applicable departments must give final approval on completed construction and
signoff that said improvements meet City Standards as outlined in these Subdivision
Regulations and other applicable adopted codes and specifications in effect at the time of
the subdivision plat approval. The Engineering Department will be responsible for the
final inspection of the streets and drainage improvements which will include, but not be
limited to, storm water drainage, street paving, curbing, sidewalks, street lighting, signage
and other items included on the approved site plans.
The City Engineering Department will inspect the improvements and issue a punch list of
any deficiencies.
1) The inspection shall document the existing condition of all roads, streets, bridges,
driveway structures, sidewalks and pedestrian access structures, related roadside
drainage facilities, signage and traffic control devices, and all other appurtenances
related to a complete system of public roads or streets. The complete system of
public roads, streets along with all related appurtenances must be in strict
compliance with all Federal, State and applicable regulations, codes, statutes and
policies in effect at the time of the request for acceptance. Conditions that will be
noted on this inspection report will consist of, but not be limited to:
a) Curb and Gutter roads: pavement cracks, pavement settlement, birdbaths, lack
of joint sealing, spalling joints, other pavement irregularities, cracked curbing,
missing curbs, dirt, trash or other debris in right-of-way, broken, cracked,
sunken or debris filled storm sewer inlets, broken driveways or sidewalks.
b) Low impact design/open ditch roads: depth, width and type of base material and
of any black top material; shape of road cross section, ditches holding water,
undersized driveway entrance culverts and other adverse drainage conditions.
c) Bridges, drainage structures, utilities and all construction located within the road
or street right-of-way or directly affecting the proper function of the system of
public streets.
d) A complete system of signage and traffic control devices in compliance with the
Tennessee Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
e) Any and all other items related to the safe operation and maintenance of a
complete system of public streets and drainage.
After notification that all deficiencies have been corrected and a final inspection has been
completed, the Engineering Department will issue preliminary acceptance of construction
Amendment 1, August 13, 2014
City of Columbia Page 5-2
Subdivision Regulations
and establish the date of Construction Completion.
a) Final inspection should be scheduled within 60 days of the initial inspection. A
complete re-inspection and a new punch list may be required after the sixty day
period.
b) Upon approval of preliminary acceptance by the Engineering Department, the bond
for the roads and street may be reduced per Section 3 of these regulations and the
bonds for the drainage facilities may be reduced per Section 3
c) Preliminary acceptance does not convey the responsibility of maintenance to the
City, but does allow for the reduction of the performance bond for a maintenance
period.
5-3 One Year Maintenance Required
A one year maintenance bond will be required in an amount of 10 percent or $5,000,
whichever is greater of the original principal amount of the infrastructure within the rightof-
way, excluding utility services. It is intended that once a project is complete and the
performance bond converted to a maintenance bond, then a follow up inspection will
occur before the end of one year period. If no deficiencies are noted, Engineering will
recommend final acceptance of the street and drainage improvements; Waste water will
separately accept the sewer improvements.
5-4 Acceptance Procedure
A request in writing must be presented to the City of Columbia (Engineering Department)
from the developer or his designee for the City to consider preliminary or final acceptance
(separate letter at each stage) of a subdivision, or any approved sections therein.
At such time that a final inspection of all improvements has been made and deemed by
the appropriate departments to be in compliance with City Subdivision Regulation
standards preliminary acceptance will be issued by the Engineering Department. After
the one year maintenance period a follow up inspection will be performed and upon
approval the Engineering Department will prepare a City Council Resolution for final
acceptance.
5-5 City Council Resolution
The Resolutions to accept either sewer and/or drainage and street improvements will be

February 6, 2012
City of Columbia
Subdivision Regulations Page A-4
I. GENERAL CONDITIONS
A. Construction Costs
The DEVELOPER shall pay for all material and labor necessary to install and complete the
roads, sidewalks, sewers, utilities and other facilities in accordance with this agreement.
B. Bonding
At the time of execution of this agreement, the DEVELOPER agrees that prior to recording a
final plat, said DEVELOPER shall give the CITY an Irrevocable Letter-of-Credit, on a bank
licensed to do business in Tennessee and insured by the FDIC, irrevocable without
conditions, and callable upon a bank doing business in Columbia, Tennessee, in an amount
determined by the Engineering Department for utilities and improvements, including roads,
sidewalks, drainage, and other improvements specified by the plans and plats of the
development approved by the CITY and the Planning Commission. This Letter-of-Credit shall
secure performance of all obligations of the DEVELOPER under this agreement pursuant to
Planning Commission approved plans and filings. The Letter-of-Credit shall meet all
requirements established in Article 3 (ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND
MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS) of the Subdivision Regulations and secure full
compliance with all terms and conditions of this agreement, including payment of all amounts
payable by the DEVELOPER or DEVELOPER'S obligations hereunder, and its obligations
under the warranty and indemnification provisions hereof. The Letter-of-Credit may be called
for failure to comply with the provisions of this agreement in whole or in part according to the
terms of the Letter-of-Credit. The Letter-of-Credit will not be released, except and until there
has been full compliance with this agreement and upon certification of a licensed engineer
that the development has been completed in full compliance with the approved plat and
construction plans.
C. Inspection
The CITY shall have a continuous right to inspect the work and facilities to assure that the
facilities are constructed in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations and approved
construction plans.
D. Right of Entry
The CITY shall have the right, in case a Letter-of Credit is called for noncompliance, to enter
upon any property of the DEVELOPER and take all necessary actions to complete the work
and obligations not completed.
E. Acceptance of Facilities
Upon notice by the CITY of acceptance of all or part of the facilities, then those facilities
specified in the acceptance shall become the property of the CITY free from all claims from
any person or entity without the necessity of any further writing, agreement, or deed. The
parties intend that this agreement shall operate as a conveyance of the facilities when the
facilities are accepted. The DEVELOPER further agrees that any facilities placed within a
public or platted right-of-way or dedicated public easement are irrevocably dedicated to the
public use without any right of reimbursement or compensation of any kind.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia
Subdivision Regulations Page A-5
F. Failure to Install
In the event the DEVELOPER fails to install the facilities in accordance with the terms of this
agreement, the CITY may, in its sole discretion, elect to accept all or a portion of the facilities
installed. Should the CITY choose to accept all or a portion of these facilities, the CITY shall
become the sole owner of these facilities. The CITY may give notice of acceptance by writing
delivered to the DEVELOPER or recorded in the Registers Office of Maury County,
Tennessee. No further writing or deed shall be required. The CITYS election to accept such
facilities shall not be construed as an assumption of any obligation related to these facilities
such as the obligation to maintain the facilities or to pay for any part of the cost of installing
the facilities.
G. Fees Not Refundable
If the DEVELOPER fails to install the facilities in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, no portion of the review fees or other amounts paid to the CITY shall be
refundable to the DEVELOPER.
H. Legal Expense in Case of Default
In the event the DEVELOPER or its sureties breach this agreement, they shall bear all costs
of the CITYS reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in

All currently existing CITY ordinances, rules and regulations and the Subdivision Regulations
adopted by the Planning Commission are made a part of this agreement.
In the event of a conflict between the terms of this agreement and a CITY ordinance, the
ordinance shall prevail. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this agreement and
the Subdivision Regulations, the Subdivision Regulations shall prevail. All work done under
this agreement is to be performed in accordance with plans, and specifications approved by
the City and made a part, hereof.
J. Agreement Not Assignable
No third party shall obtain any benefits or rights under this agreement nor shall the rights or
duties be assigned by either party.
K. Revocation and Interpretation
This agreement shall bind DEVELOPER when executed by DEVELOPER and may not be
revoked by DEVELOPER without permission of the CITY, even if the agreement has not
been executed by the CITY, or does not bind CITY, for other reasons. This agreement shall
be interpreted in accordance with Tennessee law and may only be enforced in the Chancery
Court or Circuit Court or Court of competent jurisdiction of Maury County, Tennessee, and
Tennessee Appellate Courts.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia
Subdivision Regulations Page A-6
L. No Oral Agreement
This agreement may not be orally amended and supersedes all prior negotiations,
commitments or understandings.
M. Separability
If any portion of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, the CITY shall have the right to
determine whether the remainder of the agreement shall remain in effect or whether the
agreement shall be void and all rights of the DEVELOPER pursuant to this agreement
terminated.
N. Transferability
The DEVELOPER or Owner agrees that he will not transfer the property on which this
proposed subdivision is to be located without first providing the CITY with notice of when the
transfer is to occur and who the proposed transferee is, along with appropriate address and
telephone numbers. If it is the transferee's intention to develop this subdivision in accordance
with the agreement, the DEVELOPER agrees to provide the CITY an Assumption Agreement
whereby the transferee agrees to perform the improvements required under this agreement
and to provide the security needed to assure such performance. Said agreement will be
subject to the approval of the CITY Attorney. The DEVELOPER and Owner understand that
if he transfers said property without providing the notice of transfer and Assumption
Agreement as required herein, he will be in breach of this agreement and in violation of the
subdivision regulations. The DEVELOPER further agrees that he shall remain liable under
the terms of this agreement though a subsequent sale of all or part of said property occurs,
unless an Assumption Agreement is entered into between the new owners and the CITY and
a new agreement and Performance Bond is issued naming the new owners as principal.
O. Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions to Be Filed
In the event a home owners association is required or will be established, the DEVELOPER
will submit a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions to be filed with and
recorded with the final plat. The Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions shall
contain all provisions required by the Zoning Ordinances, of the CITY and shall include
provisions for a home owners' association to maintain all detention or retention ponds,
common drainage ditches and any and all common areas. The Declaration of Covenants,
Conditions and Restrictions shall contain provisions for the CITY, to have the right, but not
the obligation, to enforce any restrictions dealing with health, safety, and welfare which could
be, otherwise, enforced by any land owner of record in the development. The Declaration of
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions shall also contain provisions for assessments of
property for maintenance of common areas and provisions for enforcement of the
assessments by liens, removal of voting rights, and enforcement at law and equity. The
Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions shall make adequate and sufficient
provisions for the maintenance of any commonly owned detention ponds or drainage areas
to include an amortizing of maintenance costs to be provided to the home owners'
association by the DEVELOPER at the time of the establishment of the home owners'
association. The Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions shall run with the
land and must be approved by the Planning Department, prior to recordation, as a part of the
final plat.
February 6, 2012
City of Columbia
Subdivision Regulations Page A-7
P. Time Period for Construction
In consideration of the promise by the CITY to accept for maintenance the streets, utilities and other
infrastructure covered by this agreement, the DEVELOPER agrees to be bound to complete within
two (2) years of commencement of construction all improvements shown on the plat and plans and all
things required by this agreement. The DEVELOPER further agrees that if due to unforeseen
circumstances, he is unable to complete all work included in this agreement within the time specified
above, but desires to complete said agreement to the satisfaction of the CITY, he shall submit a
written request for extension of the agreement period to the CITY at least sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the existing agreement period, specifying the reason for his failure to complete the work
as agreed and a prospective date for such completion. The DEVELOPER further agrees that if the
bond (Letter-of-Credit) executed to secure the value of the work to be performed under this
agreement, due to inflation or rising costs, is inadequate to secure the cost of said improvements at the
time an extension is sought, he will provide the additional security to bring the bond amount in line
with current cost projections as made by the CITY. The CITY agrees that it will not unreasonably
withhold approval of extensions where the DEVELOPER has complied with the requirements of
notice to the CITY and provided the required additional security, if any is needed. The DEVELOPER
understands that his failure to follow this extension procedure constitutes a breach of this agreement
and places him in violation of the Subdivision Regulations. The DEVELOPER further understands
that should he fail to complete any part of the work outlined in this agreement in a good and
workmanlike manner as approved the CITY shall reserve the right to withhold and withdraw all
building permits and sewer service within the subdivision until all items of this Agreement have been
fulfilled by the DEVELOPER.

February 6, 2012
City of Columbia
Subdivision Regulations Page A-9
B. Storm Water Management Systems
The DEVELOPER shall be responsible for all storm water management work, including ditch
stabilization, bank protection, and fencing adjacent to open ditches made necessary by the
development of this subdivision.
1. The DEVELOPER shall provide and deliver the formal written opinion of a licensed and bonded
professional engineer certifying that he has reviewed the entire water shed wherein the
subdivision is located and that upon full development at the greatest allowable use density under
existing zoning of all land within that watershed, the proposed subdivision will not increase, alter
or affect the flow of surface waters, nor contribute to same, so as to damage, flood or adversely
affect any property. Further, the DEVELOPER agrees to hold harmless and defend the CITY
from any claim, cause of action or liability, alleged and/or proven, to have arisen directly or
indirectly from alteration to the surface water by reason of the DEVELOPER'S design,
construction, installation or the development itself, in whole or part.
2. To properly manage storm water runoff during the construction process the DEVELOPER shall
provide necessary erosion control in accordance with the storm water management plan for the
development as approved by the CITY in conformance with the published design standards and
specifications of the CITY. All freshly excavated and embankment areas not covered with
satisfactory vegetation shall be fertilized, mulched and seeded and/or sodded as required by the
CITY to prevent erosion. In the event the CITY determines that necessary erosion control is not
being provided by the DEVELOPER, the proper authority shall officially notify the
DEVELOPER of the problem. If the DEVELOPER has not begun to provide satisfactory erosion
control within five (5) days after the notice, then the proper authority shall issue a stop work order
to be effective until satisfactory erosion control measures have been provided.
3. Any and all unenclosed water courses lying partially or wholly within the bounds of this
subdivision shall be constructed to adequate cross section to provide design flow without threat of
erosion or flooding of any property within this subdivision, or of any adjoining property.
4. All storm water management structures necessitated by the infrastructure plans for this
development that affect any watercourse lying partially or wholly within this subdivision are to be
provided by the DEVELOPER.
5. It is understood and agreed that the CITY in its proprietary function is not and could not be
expected to oversee, supervise, or direct the construction of all drainage improvements, and the
excavation incident thereto. Neither is the CITY vested with the original design responsibility nor
the means to formally survey elevations or the locations of improvements at every stage of the
construction process. The CITY is vested with the right of periodic inspections, stop work order
and final approval as a measure of secondary or subsequent enforcement. The DEVELOPER has
and shall retain the responsibility to properly anticipate, survey, design and construct the
subdivision storm water improvements and give full assurance that same shall not adversely affect
the flow or quality of surface water from or upon any property. In providing technical assistance,
plan and design review, the CITY does not and shall not relieve or accept any liability from the
DEVELOPER.

Article 1. Introduction
SECTION 1.01 PURPOSE
Access management is the control of driveways and intersections to manage access to land development, while simultaneously preserving the flow of traffic on the surrounding road system in terms of safety, capacity, and speed. Implementing an access management program based on the strategies and principles described in this ordinance will encourage smooth and safe traffic flow.
This document describes transportation design requirements that present a comprehensive approach to access management within the City of Columbia. This ordinance is intended to better connect land use and transportation within the City. These requirements are presented to provide improved transportation throughout the corporate limits.
SECTION 1.02 JURISDICTION OF THESE REGULATIONS
Except as otherwise specified or required by law, these rules and regulations govern access management, along with all associated improvements, within the street network of the City of Columbia, Maury County, Tennessee, and shall apply to all areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Columbia. Exceptions to any of the standards of this Ordinance shall be made to the Columbia Planning Commission, as specified in Section 4.04 of the Ordinance.
SECTION 1.03 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS AND AGREEMENTS
1.03.1 Conflict with Other Public Laws, Ordinances, Regulations, or Permits
Where provisions of this ordinance impose greater restrictions than those of any other City, State, or Federal regulation, statue, or ordinance the provisions of this ordinance shall be controlling. Where the provisions of any City, State, or Federal regulation, statue, or ordinance imposes greater restrictions than this ordinance, the provisions of such City, State, or Federal regulation, statue, or ordinance shall be controlling.
1.03.2 Conflict with Private Agreements
This Ordinance is not intended to revoke or repeal any easement, covenant, or other private agreement. However, where the regulations of this ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, then the requirements of this ordinance shall govern. Nothing in this Ordinance shall modify or repeal any private covenant or deed restriction, but such covenant or restriction shall not excuse any failure to comply with this Ordinance. The City shall not be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants, or agreements between private third parties.

AASHTO
(American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) which publishes documents in this manual, including A Policy on Geometric Design (Green Book) and Roadway Design Guide.
Acceleration Lane
A speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of enabling a vehicle entering the roadway to increase its speed to a rate at which it can more safely merge with through traffic. This also may be titled as an accel lane."
Access
Entrance to or exit from land adjacent to a public road.
Angle of Twoway Driveway
The angle of deflection measured from the centerline of the nearest travel lane to the centerline of the driveway. An angle of 90 degrees is desirable.
Auxiliary Lane
The portion of the roadway adjoining the traveled-way for parking, speed change, turning, weaving, truck climbing, and other purposes supplementary to the through-traffic movement.
Corner Clearance
The distance from an intersection of a public or private road to the nearest access along the highway system. This distance is measured from the closest edge of pavement of the intersecting road to the closest edge of pavement of the access measured along the traveled way (through lanes).
Curb Cut
An access or driveway providing ingress and/or egress to or from the highway system along a "curbed" section of highway.
Commercial Driveway
Any private entrance, exit, ramp, tunnel, bridge, side road or other vehicular passageway to any property used for commercial purposes, except a farm or dwelling house not exceeding a four-family capacity, and leading to or from any public road on the highway system.
Deceleration Lane
A speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of enabling a vehicle that is making an exit turn from a roadway to slow to a safe turning speed after it has left the mainstream of faster-moving traffic. Also called a decel lane"; it denotes a right turn lane or a left turn lane into a development.
6
Driveway Width
The width of a driveway shall be measured perpendicular to centerline of the driveway within 5 feet of the Right-of-Way, from edge of pavement to edge of pavement or face-of-curb to face-of-curb where curb and gutter are installed.

Article 2. Access Management
Access management is a set of techniques to allow for the control of access to highways, arterials, collectors, and other, select streets within Columbia. The result is a more safe and efficient street network for users. Without access management, the transportation network experiences an increase in traffic congestion, and accidents throughout the overall transportation network.
SECTION 2.01 IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS MANAGEMENT
With less state and federal monies available for new transportation projects, the need for effective transportation systems management strategies is greater than ever before. By managing access, the City aims to directly increase public safety, extend the life of major roadways, reduce traffic congestion, and improve both the appearance and quality of the built environment.
Without access management, the function and character of major transportation corridors can deteriorate rapidly. Failure to manage access is associated with the following adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts:
? An increase in vehicular crashes
? More collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists
? Accelerated reduction in roadway efficiency
? Unsightly commercial strip development
? Degradation of scenic landscapes
? More cut-through traffic in residential areas due to overburdened arterials
? Homes and businesses adversely impacted by a continuous cycle of widening roads
? Increased commute times, fuel consumption, and vehicular emissions as numerous driveways and traffic signals intensify congestion and delays along major roads
Poor access management comes with both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include adverse impacts to businesses through the difficulty of customers entering and exiting businesses safely. Access to corner businesses may be blocked by queuing traffic. Customers begin to patronize businesses with safer, more convenient access and avoid businesses in areas of poor access design. Gradually the older developed areas begin to deteriorate due to access and aesthetic problems, and investment moves to newer better-managed corridors. Indirect costs include lost time due to increased traffic congestion.
After access problems have been created, they are difficult to solve. Reconstructing an arterial street is costly and disruptive to the public and abutting homes and businesses. The shallow property depth, multiple owners, and right-of-way limitations common to older corridors generally preclude effective redesign of access and site circulation. In some cases, a new arterial or bypass must be built to replace the functionally obsolescent roadway, and the process begins again in a new location. Access management programs can help stop this cycle of functional
9
obsolescence, thereby protecting both public and private investment in major transportation corridors.
(a) Safety
Research in the last 50 years has consistently shown that Access Management increases roadway safety. As outlined in the Access Management Manual of the Transportation Research Board (TRB), the reduction of traffic conflict points, higher design standards for access points, and increased awareness/response time for drivers has improved safety on the nations highways and arterials. Four key observations have come to the forefront:
1. Increasing the number of access points on a roadway will increase its crash rate.
2. Roads with medians are safer than undivided roads, or roads with two-way left- turn lanes (TWLTL).
3. It is safer for vehicles to make a U-turn and a right turn, than to make a direct left turn into or from a driveway.
4. Medians improve pedestrian safety.
SECTION 2.02 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ACCESS MANAGEMENT
Most, if not all, current access management policies are derived from the Transportation Research Boards (TRB) Access Management Manual, which was published in 2003 and updated in 2014. TRB describes ten (10) principles of access management, which were derived from the organizations expertise in transportation. They include the following:
1. Provide a Specialized Roadway System: Design and manage roadways according to their primary functions.
2. Limit Direct Access to Major Roadways: Roadways that serve higher volumes of through traffic need more access control to preserve their function.
3. Promote Intersection Hierarchy: An efficient transportation network provides appropriate transitions from one functional classification to another. This results in a series of intersection types that range from the junction of two freeways or a freeway and a major arterial to a driveway connecting to a local street.
4. Locate Signals to Favor "Through" Movements: Long, uniform spacing of intersections on major roadways enhances the ability to coordinate signals and to ensure continuous movement of traffic at the desired speed.
5. Preserve the Functional Area of Intersections and Interchanges: The functional area of an intersection or interchange is the area that is critical to its safe and efficient operation. Access connections too close to these intersections or interchange ramps can cause serious traffic conflicts.
6. Limit the Number of Conflict Points: A less complex driving environment is accomplished by limiting the number and type of conflicts between vehicles, vehicles and pedestrians, and vehicles and bicyclists (Figure 1).
7. Separate Conflict Areas: Separating conflict areas helps to simplify the driving task and contributes to improved traffic operations and safety.
8. Remove Turning Vehicles from Through Traffic Lanes: Turning lanes reduce the severity and duration of conflicts between turning vehicles and improves the safety and efficiency of intersections.
9. Use Non-traversable Medians to Manage Left Turn Movements: Non-traversable
10
medians and other techniques that minimize left turns are effective in improving roadway safety and efficiency (Figure 2).
10. Provide a Supporting Street and Circulation System: Well-planned communities provide a supporting network of local and collector streets to accommodate development, as well as unified property access and circulation systems. Interconnected street and circulation systems support alternative modes of transportation and provide alternative routes for bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.

These principles have been adopted and implemented by various states, including the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT). They have also been employed by numerous local jurisdictions within Middle Tennessee that face growth pressures, including Metro Nashville, Franklin, Murfreesboro, and Mt. Juliet.
These principles provide the foundation for the strategies recommended in this ordinance.
11
SECTION 2.03 ROADWAY FUNCTIONAL CLASS
Roadway facilities are each classified according to the amount of access and mobility they provide or how the roadway functions. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), functional classification is the process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes, or systems, according to the character of service they are intended to provide. As land access increases, traffic movement decreases on the lower classified roadways and vice versa  as land access decreases, traffic movement increases along the higher classified roads.
The functional classification of existing facilities is significant because it specifies the desired amount of access control or locations where vehicles can enter or leave a roadway. When there is no access control, intersecting roads or driveways may connect to the mainline at any point. Typically, local roads have no access control. With partial control of access there is minimum spacing of access locations. With full control of access, connections are only allowed at major crossroads  such as interchanges along an interstate. Full or partial control of access helps reduce traffic conflicts.
The diagram below shows schematically how various street classifications relate to each other in terms of movement and access. As land access increases, traffic movement decreases on the lower classified roadways and vice versa  as land access decreases, traffic movement increases along the higher classified roads.

(a) Connect Columbia Transportation Plan
The Citys Transportation Plan, adopted (date), classifies the five major functional systems, which is adopted as the framework for this ordinance, as follows:
Interstate and Freeway Classification
Interstates and Freeways are limited access divided highways with grade separated junctions, and without traffic lights or stop signs. Providing drivers with mobility is the highest priority on this type of facility, with access provided only at interchanges spaced at least 1-2 miles apart.
Interstate and Freeway Roadways in Columbia:
? Interstate 65
? Sections of US 43 (New Lawrenceburg Highway)
Principal Arterial Classification
The principal arterial system serves major centers of activity, the highest traffic volume corridors, and the longest trip destinations. Prior to the Interstate system, these roads functioned as the primary routes for long-distance travel and therefore emphasize mobility rather than access. They still carry a substantial percentage of trips entering and leaving the urban area, including thru-movements. These roads link to the interstates and freeways. In 2012, Congress passed federal legislation which also made all principal arterials part of the National Highway System.
Principal Arterial Roadways in Columbia:
? US 31 (Nashville Highway/North Garden Street/Carmack Boulevard/Pulaski Highway)
? US 412 (Bear Creek Pike/Hampshire Pike)
? US 43 (non-freeway portions)
? SR 50 (West and South James Campbell Boulevard)
Minor Arterial Classification
Compared to principal arterials, minor arterials are intended for trips of more moderate length and serve smaller geographic areas. They supplement and link to the principal arterial system and provide connections within a community.
Minor Arterial Roadways in Columbia:
? North James Campbell Boulevard
? Santa Fe Pike
? Trotwood Avenue
? Campbellsville Pike
? Hatcher Lane
? Industrial Park Road
13
? Tom J. Hitch Parkway
Collector Classification
The collector street system provides both access to land and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial and industrial areas. Unlike arterial roads, it is common for collector roads to pass through residential neighborhoods to collect traffic from local neighborhood streets and channel it into the arterial system. In the central business district and other areas of similar development and traffic density, the collector system may include a street grid used for traffic circulation.
Collector Roadways in Columbia:
? Iron Bridge Road
? Mapleash Road
? Mooresville Pike
? Cayce Lane
? Sunnyside Lane
? Rutherford Lane
? Lion Parkway
? Theta Pike
Local Street Classification
The local street system is made up of all other facilities not classified as one of the categories described above. Local streets primary function is to provide direct access to properties, and they are not intended for high speeds or heavy traffic volumes. This segment of the classification contain all roads not otherwise named above or in the City Major Thoroughfare Plan Map.
As indicated in Figure 4, a functional roadway system facilitates a progressive transition in the flow of traffic from the provision of access to the provision of movement. Interstate (or Freeways) and arterial facilities primarily provide the function of moving vehicles, while collector and local streets concentrate more on providing access to individual properties, homes, and businesses.

Article 3. Access Management Regulations
The following access management strategies will be utilized for roadways within the City of Columbia, Tennessee.
SECTION 3.01 DRIVEWAYS
(a) General Provisions
(i) It shall be unlawful for any person to cut, break, or remove any curb along a street except as herein authorized.
(ii) This section shall be deemed to be supplemental to other sections regulating the use of public property, and in case of conflict, the more restrictive regulation shall govern.
(iii) Decisions related to the provision of this ordinance shall be made by the City Engineer or designee (unless otherwise noted). If the City Engineer provides for a designee, this shall be noted, in writing, to the Director of Development Services.
(iv) Adequate sight distance shall be provided for a passenger motor vehicle making a left or right turn exiting from a driveway. This determination shall be made by the City Engineer of the Columbia.
(v) The specifications and guidelines set forth in this ordinance are to be applied to all roadways and properties that abut these roadways within Columbia, unless otherwise indicated.
(vi) Any existing access locations, at the time of enactment of this Ordinance, that do not meet the minimum standards documented herein shall be deemed non- conforming driveways. These non-conforming driveways shall be allowed to remain in use until such time as a change in use or intensity is requested of the local government by the property owner. No changes shall be granted until the offending driveway(s) are brought into conformity with Article III, Access Management Regulations.
(vii) Non-compliance with Article III, Access Management Regulations shall be reason for denial of a permitting or development application request. The Planning Commission, the City Council, and/or City Staff may cite non-compliance with the regulations herein as grounds for deferral or denial of any relative application.
(b) Location of Driveway Access
(i) Application of the driveway access location and design policy requires identification of the functional classification of the street on which access is requested and then applying the appropriate spacing requirements. Streets are classified as follows:
15
(1) Freeway;
(2) Arterial;
(3) Collector; and,
(4) Local Street.
(ii) Freeway, arterial, and collector streets in Columbia are indicated on the Major Thoroughfare Plan Map. The functional classification of any street in the jurisdiction not indicated as an arterial or collector street on this plan shall be determined using the functional street classification defined by section 2.03 of this ordinance.
(iii) Location of Driveways on State Routes
(1) The radius return for a driveway access on state routes shall meet the following requirement, which is from TDOTs 2015 Manual for Constructing Driveway Entrances on State Highways:
RURAL
Single-family residential
10 ft
All other uses (including multifamily)
20 ft URBAN/SUBURBAN
Single-family residential- 5 feet
5 ft
All other uses (including multifamily)
20 ft Note: When a single-unit truck or tractor trail is used as the design vehicle, the minimum required edge clearance shall be equal to the required driveway radius.
(2) When driveways are to be jointly used through an access easement by two or more property owners, the property line separation requirements of 3.01(b)(iii)(1) may be waived. However, the access easement, signed by all property owners within the common development, must be provided to Development Services for review and approval. The access easement, once approved by Development Services, shall be recorded with the Maury County Register of Deeds.
(3) TDOT driveway permits shall also be obtained.
(iv) Driveway access to arterials or collectors streets shall be designed to ensure that parking or loading areas shall not require backing maneuvers in a public street right-of-way.
(v) All developments shall have access to a public right-of way. Access shall be through a public ROW or through an access easement. The fewest possible
16
access points shall be used to safely accommodate expected traffic volumes. A traffic study/analysis will be required to justify a greater number of access points than granted in Table 1. Regardless of the number of granted access points, minimum spacing requirements as described in section 3.01(c) shall be maintained. The number of granted access points shall be as listed in Table 1.
TABLE 1: Number of Access Points  * Type of Development Number of Potential Access Points
Individual Residential Lot

Residential Subdivision
2
Nonresidential < 30 required parking spaces

Nonresidential >30 required parking spaces
2 Cross access to adjacent properties shall also be required as per Section 3.01(f). *These access points shall be considered the minimum for each type of development. Exceptions to the standards established in this subsection shall follow the procedures outlines in Section 4.04 of this Ordinance.
(vi) For corner tracts, primary access shall be provided from the lesser (lowest classification) street. The determination as to the lesser (or greater) street shall be based on the functional street classification of the jurisdiction.
(vii) No cuts through a left turn reservoir of a median shall be permitted in order to provide for left turn movements to driveway approaches.
(viii) Driveways in right turn lane transition areas shall not be permitted.
(ix) Driveways shall not be permitted in the corner clearance area of an intersection as defined in section 3.04 Corner Clearance.
(x) When a commercial or multifamily development abuts more than one public street, access shall be provided from the lesser (lowest classification) street. Access to each abutting street may be allowed only if the following criteria are met:
(1) It is demonstrated that such access is required to adequately serve
17
driveway volumes and will not be detrimental or unsafe to traffic operations on public streets. The Engineer may require the submittal of a traffic study which demonstrates that such access is required.
(2) The minimum requirements for the corner clearance for commercial or multifamily driveways are met.
(xi) In making a determination as to the location of driveway access, the following characteristics shall be considered:
(1) The characteristics of the proposed land use;
(2) The existing traffic flow conditions and the future traffic demand anticipated on the development and the adjacent street system;
(3) The location of the property;
(4) The size of the property;
(5) The orientation of structures on the site;
(6) The number of driveways needed to accommodate anticipated traffic;
(7) The number and location of driveways on existing adjacent and opposite properties;
(8) The location and carrying capacity of intersections;
(9) The proper geometric design of driveways;
(10) The spacing between opposite and adjacent driveways;
(11) The internal circulation between driveways; and,
(12) The speed of the adjacent roadway.
(c) Driveway spacing
(i) Driveway access spacing shall be measured from the centerline of the proposed driveway pavement to the nearest edge of the roadway of the adjacent or opposite driveway or street as indicated in Figure 5. Note that the spacing requirements apply to both opposite and adjacent driveways on undivided highways, but it only applies to adjacent driveways on divided highways.
(ii) Separation between driveways on all arterials and collectors shall be based upon the functional classification of the roadway in accordance with Table 2.

220
330 Distance used for the above regulations shall be measured in feet *Spacing requirements shall only apply to adjacent driveways on roadways with medians.
(iii) Spacing of One-Way Driveways
The spacing criteria presented in Table 2 does not apply to the distance between two one-way driveways (driveway pair). A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in Figure 6. A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in Table 2.
19
Figure 6: Spacing for One-Way Driveways
(iv) The connection spacing requirements may be reduced in situations where they prove impractical, but in no case shall the permitted spacing be less than 80% of the applicable standard. Such a reduction in spacing requirements must still result, to the greatest extent possible, in uniform spacing between adjacent driveways.
(v) If the connection spacing of this ordinance cannot be achieved, then a system of joint use driveways and cross access easements may be required.
(vi) Exceptions from these standards shall be permitted according to Article 4, Section 4.04 of this Ordinance.
(d) Interior Circulation and Driveway Throat Depth
(i) Interior driveways, parking aisles, and site vehicular circulation patterns shall be designed in order to minimize impacts to public streets rights-of-way. Figure 7 provides an illustrative example.
(ii) Nonresidential uses shall provide a minimum throat depth of at least 30 feet to provide for efficient and safe stacking of vehicles from a private lot onto a public right-of-way.
(iii) If no other design alternatives exist and interior drives are proposed, which do not meet minimum spacing, exceptions may be made to the Planning Commission per Section 4.04.
20
Figure 7: Placement of Interior Drives
(e) Driveway Consolidation/Shared Access
In any situation in which development or subdivision results in inadequate access or road frontage, cross access easement(s) shall be required as part of the Site Plan or Preliminary or Final Plat, as applicable.
(i) Cross access easement(s) shall be required between adjacent lots fronting on arterial and collector streets in order to minimize the total number of access points along those streets and to facilitate traffic flow between lots. The location and dimensions of said easement(s) shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
(ii) Cross access easement(s) may be required across any lot fronting on an arterial or collector street in order to minimize the number of access points and facilitate access between and across individual lots. The location and dimension of said easement(s) shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
(iii) Subdivisions with frontage on arterial roadways shall be designed into shared access points to and from the highway. Normally a maximum of two accesses shall be allowed regardless of the number of lots or businesses served.
21
Figure 8: Joint and Cross Access
(f) Cross Access
Driveways shall be designed and constructed so as to align with driveways or streets on the opposite side of the highway. The alignment of through movements crossing the highway shall be such that abrupt shifts in the travel pattern are not required.
(i) Adjacent commercial or office properties classified as major traffic generators (retail strip centers, office parks, or multi-family residential complexes adjacent to other multi-family residential, commercial and office properties) shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites.
(ii) A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established wherever feasible along the frontage and/or between parking areas and the building site shall incorporate the following:
(1) A continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each block served to provide for driveway separation consistent with this access management ordinance.
(2) A design speed of 10 mph and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles;
(3) Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access via a service drive;
(4) A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged wherever feasible.
22
(iii) The Development Services Department may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical, provided all of the following requirements are met:
(1) Joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section.
(2) The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section.
(3) The property owner enters into a written agreement with the City and records the agreement with the deed. This agreement should, at a minimum, indicate that any pre-existing non- conforming driveway connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint use driveway. The Development Services Department shall have leeway in directing the language of any agreement to fit the specific conditions of the site.
(iv) The Development Services Department may modify or waive the requirements of this section where the characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation system impractical.
(v) Pursuant to this section, property owners shall:
(1) Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint use driveways and cross access or service drive.
(2) Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the thoroughfare will be dedicated to the City and pre-existing non-conforming driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway.
(3) Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property owners.
SECTION 3.02 MEDIANS
(a) Non-traversable Medians with Left Turn Lanes
One of the most effective measures to improve safety on a roadway is to install a non-traversable median. Raised or grassy medians in the center of a road separate opposing lanes of traffic and restrict turning and crossing movements.
(b) Continuous Two-Way Left-Turn Lane (TWLTL)
(i) A continuous TWLTL provides the most alternatives for vehicles to cross a median. This roadway treatment provides accessibility when there are numerous curb cuts on an existing corridor.
23
(ii) A TWLTL in the center of a roadway is safer than having no turning lane, but is not as safe as a non-traversable median with directional openings. Engineering judgement should be taken to select the most appropriate option for any road segment.
(iii) In general a TWLTL functions well for roadways with moderate traffic volumes (up to about 25,000 vehicles per day) and have many commercial driveways and a high percentage of turning movements. They can also work well where there are multiple driveways but a low percentage of turning volumes, like a major collector or minor arterial traversing a residential area.
(vi) TWLTLs are less effective in high-volume situations (more than 25,000 vehicles per day), and much more so in an area with commercial driveways too close together. Driveway spacing and density still need to be well-managed. The center turn lane is also not recommended where there are more than two travel lanes in either direction.
(v) Along transit corridors with TWLTL medians, pedestrian median refuge islands would need to be added at transit stop locations, to allow safer pedestrian crossings. Locations where a transit stop is located within 300 feet of a signalized intersection, and safe pedestrian crossing accommodations are already provided at the intersection, could be exempt from this requirement. When opposing transit stops are located more than 300 feet from each other, two separate pedestrian median refuge islands would be required.
(c) Spacing of Median Crossovers
(i) When the applicant is requesting a median crossover on a divided arterial highway with a non-traversable median, the spacing standards shown in Table 3 apply.
24
Table 3: Spacing of Median Crossovers
Source: Transportation Research Board (TRB) Access Manual
(ii) Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that median openings will be allowed.
(d) Median Opening Criteria
(i) New median openings or turn bays shall be allowed to provide access to a city street or to provide access to a private development only where the opening or turn bay can be constructed to satisfy the design standards set forth in this article.
(1) In no case shall median openings be located within the taper or storage area for another median opening or intersection.
(ii) Where a new median opening is proposed for construction, a turn bay shall also be constructed unless the opening is designed to physically prohibit left turns from the divided roadway.
(iii) If a roadway project is pending or under construction at the time of approval of a request for a median opening or turn bay, the approved median opening or turn
NOTE: RURAL or URBAN CONDITION refers to the functional classification of a roadway, not whether that roadway lies within anUrbanized Area or Rural Area. Urbanized, Small Urban and Rural Area boundaries indicate only population as designated bythe Bureau of the Census. Functional class refers to the group or system of the roadway according to the character of service it isintended to provide for mobility (speed limit), connectivity, and access.
25
bay shall be constructed to the standards for the approved or completed roadway; however, in no case shall construction standards be less than standards set forth above, and the person requesting the change shall pay any and all costs required to make the improvement. The person or party requesting the median opening or turn bay, if approved, shall pay to the City the estimated costs associated with design and installation of the median opening prior to the construction of same. If the estimate is insufficient to cover said costs the requesting party shall pay to the City any additional sums. If the estimated costs exceed the actual cost the overage shall be paid on completion of the project to the requesting person or party.
(vi) If the requesting person or entity is to construct the median opening or turn bay, the procedures and requirements for construction and public dedication of median openings and turn bays shall be as provided for in this ordinance.
(v) Construction and materials shall be in accordance with the latest revisions of the TDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.
(e) Median Openings Across Turn Lanes
(i) Due to the danger of queues building up across a median opening, turning lanes must also be avoided in median openings
(ii) Driveways shall not be located where it is necessary for left turning vehicles to cross an intersections left-turn lane or right-turn lane. This problem is often exacerbated as queues build, prompting well-meaning good Samaritans to allow the left turner through, only to crash with a vehicle moving freely in the separate right-turn lane.
Figure 9:
Avoid median openings across left and right turn lanes
26
SECTION 3.03 TURN LANES
(a) Deceleration Lanes
(i) Left turn/Right turn deceleration lanes may be required as determined by the City Engineer at driveway accesses and designed in accordance with TDOT and City of Columbia regulations.
(b) Right-turn/Acceleration Lanes
(i) Right-turn / Acceleration Lanes shall be a minimum of 50 feet in length with an additional 100 foot long taper. The length may be required to be increased by the City Engineer, if supported by a Traffic Impact Study (TIS).
(1) Right-turn / Acceleration lanes are generally not provided on low speed highways. Acceleration lanes may be required at locations where grade, sight distance or traffic is such that the Development Services Department determines they are needed.
(2) A rightturn / acceleration lane and taper may be required at an access point under any one of the following conditions:
(a) A high traffic volume on the highway and lack of gaps in traffic make use of an acceleration lane necessary for vehicles to enter and merge with the highway traffic flow.
(b) The access location has/will have a high percentage of trucks using it.
(c) Site specific conditions create the necessity for an acceleration lane for public safety or traffic operations, as determined by a TIS or by the City Engineer.
1) When operating speeds on the highway are 55 MPH and above, fullwidth acceleration lanes of sufficient length should be considered.
2) On all driveways where a deceleration lane is provided, a tapered acceleration lane should be considered. The layout details of the acceleration lane taper are shown in Figure 10.
(ii) A right-turn acceleration lane and taper may also be required at signalized intersections if a free right-turn lane is needed to maintain an appropriate level of service.
(iii) The taper length will be included within the required acceleration length.
27
Figure 10: Acceleration Lane Taper Details
(b) Dual Left Turn Lanes
(i) Dual left turn lanes are often needed to satisfy high volume demands. Capacity analysis shall be used to identify the need for dual left turn lanes.
(ii) Dual left turn lanes are typically considered when the peak hour left turn volume is 300 vehicles or greater.
(iii) The decision to use dual left turn lanes should consider the off-peak periods as well as the peak periods. The off-peak periods may be adversely affected, since the use of dual left turn lanes typically precludes permissive left turns. If dual left turn lanes are included in the design,
(vi) The decision to use dual left turn lanes should also consider pedestrian activity in the area. Pedestrians will have greater difficulty crossing an intersection with dual left turn lanes due to the increased width.
28
SECTION 3.04 CORNER CLEARANCE
(a) General Provisions
(i) Corner clearance for driveway access shall meet or exceed the minimum driveway spacing requirements for that roadway, as showing in Table 2: Driveway Spacing Requirements.
(1) For streets classified as principal arterials, the corner clearance shall be 440 feet for urban and suburban areas and shall be 660 feet for rural areas.
(2) For streets classified as minor arterials, the corner clearance shall be at least 330 feet for urban areas and 440 feet for rural areas.
(3) For streets classified as collector roads, the corner clearance shall meet the minimum requirements of 220 feet for urban areas and 330 feet for rural areas.
(4) Local streets shall comply with Table 2, depending on the land use.
(ii) All corner lots shall be of adequate size to provide reacquired corner clearance on street frontage and front yard setbacks.
(iii) When minimum spacing requirements cannot be met due to lack of frontage and all means to acquire shared access drives or cross access easements have been exhausted, the following requirements shall apply.
(1) Intersections of arterials with channelized rightturn lanes and yield control shall require a corner clearance distance for the first downstream driveway.
(iv) If the applicant for a driveway permit determines, through analysis, that a driveway could be appropriately located closer to an intersection than the corner clearance dictates, the applicant shall submit a traffic study that, using acceptable engineering standards, concludes it is acceptable to place the driveway closer to the intersection.
29
Figure 11: Corner Clearance
(v) No driveway approach may be located closer to the corner than the as shown in Table 3, according to the distance listed in Table 3 (adapted from the 2015 Manual for Constructing Driveway Entrances on State Highways): TABLE 3: Corner Clearance Requirements Classification of Street to be Accessed by Driveway Classification of Intersecting Street Principal & Minor Arterials Collectors Local Principal & Minor Arterials

SECTION 3.05 TRAFFIC SIGNALS
(a) Spacing
(i) Closely spaced or irregularly spaced traffic signals on arterial roadways result in frequent stops, unnecessary delay, increased fuel consumption, excessive vehicular emissions, and high crash rates.
(ii) Planning ahead for long and uniform signal spacing enhances the ability to coordinate signals and to ensure continuous movement of traffic at the desired speed. Failure to carefully locate access connections or median openings that later become signalized, can cause substantial increases in arterial travel times. In addition, poor signal placement may lead to delays that cannot be overcome by computerized signal timing systems.
(iii) Optimal spacing depends on travel speed and cycle length. Research data indicate that as speed and cycle length increase, so does desired spacing.
(iv) Spacing between signalized intersections shall have a minimum separation as illustrated in Table 4.
TABLE 4: Spacing of Signalized Intersections
(v) Under certain conditions, better operation may result from the introduction of signals with less spacing if the alternative forces high volumes of traffic to an adjacent intersection. When the applicant can show, through a Traffic Impact Study, that better operations can be achieved with less spacing, an exception will be considered. Signal spacing shall be determined based upon corridor
31
performance rather than individual access requests.
(vi) Effects of Signal Spacing
(1) Spacing of signals has a direct effect on roadway efficiency.
(a) 1/2-mile signal spacing could reduce vehicle-hours of delay by over 60% and vehicle-hours of travel by over 50%, compared with signals at 1/4-mi intervals with full median openings between signals.
(b) A four-lane divided arterial having signals at uniform 1/2-mi signal spacing could carry the same volume of traffic as a six-lane divided roadway with a 1/4-mi signal spacing.
(c) Each traffic signal per mile added to a roadway reduces speed 2 to 3 mph. Table 5 indicates percentage increases in travel times that can be expected as signal density increases, using two traffic signals per mile as a base.
TABLE 5:
Percentage Increase in Travel Times as Signalized Density Increases
(2) The number of crashes and crash rates increases as the frequency of traffic signals increases.
(vii) Signal Spacing, Cycle Length, and Progression
(1) A uniform signal spacing of 1/2 mi provides for efficient signal progression at speeds of 35 mph to 45 mph along major suburban arterials. At these speeds, maximum flow rates are achieved and fuel consumption and emissions are kept to a minimum.
(viii) Deviation from the Adopted Signal Spacing Interval
(1) In many developed areas, signal spacing has already been established by
32
the locations of intersecting streets. In addition, obtaining long, uniform signalized intersection spacing is often difficult in practice when:
(a) There are severe natural or topographical constraints;
(b) Land ownership patterns were laid out by metes and bounds; and
(c) The street pattern is irregular or the area is highly urban with short blocks.
(2) When a signalized intersection deviates from the selected uniform interval, progression can be maintained by increasing the percentage of cycle length devoted to the major arterialwith a comparable decrease in green time for the intersecting street. With short cycle lengths (i.e., 60 s), each 1% deviation in intersection spacing requires an increase in green time for the major street of 1% of the cycle length to maintain progression and a 1% decrease in green time for the minor street
(3) For long cycles (120 s), the green time to the major street and red time to the minor street would need to be increased by 2% of the cycle length for each 1% deviation. This is a critical issue when considering arterialtoarterial spacing.
(4) Desired progression efficiency for different roadway
(a) As progression efficiency decreases, fuel consumption, delay at signalized intersections, and vehicular emissions increase. Because of the volumes they carry and the intense traffic demand during peak periods, a high level of progression efficiency is desirable on major urban arterials.
(b) Lower levels of efficiency are acceptable on roadways of lesser importance and lower classification because of the lower volumes, shorter trips served, and driver expectancy. Therefore, the magnitude of the deviation from an adopted or ideal uniform signal spacing interval may increase as the roadway functional classification decreases.
(c) Conditions and criteria to be addressed in the evaluation of a potential signal location include the following:
(i) Combinations of speed, cycle length, and minimum progression efficiency for both the peak and off-peak periods;
(ii) Computer software to be used;
(iii) Traffic volumes;
(iv) Development conditions;
(v) Length of roadway segment to be evaluated; and
(vi) Other relevant factors.
(d) Alternatively, the state code or local ordinance may specify minimum progression efficiency criteria for different functional classes of roadways and provide that the conditions (combinations of speed and cycle length, volumes, length of roadway segment, acceptable computer software, and so forth) will be specified for each individual case.
33
(b) Traffic signal timing
(i) In all cases, signal timing shall be coordinated to facilitate traffic flow. For undeveloped sections of a corridor, two-mile spacing should be considered.
(ii) For frontage or service roads, preference in traffic signal timing and operation shall be given to highways and cross-streets of a higher access category or function.
SECTION 3.06 FRONTAGE ROADS
(a) Frontage Road Concepts
(i) An effective treatment to consolidate the number of access points, and therefore conflict points, on an arterial highway can be achieved through the construction of a frontage road or a reverse frontage road. These concepts are depicted in Figure 15.
(ii) A frontage road is a local street (one-way or two-way) that serves multiple land uses (properties) and provides one to two points of access onto the main roadway. Frontage roads are advantageous in commercial and retail environmental along arterials.
(iii) Frontage roads have a place in serving commercial development as well as residential access needs. When carefully designed to facilitate access and maintain signal operations, frontage roads can be a viable access management technique for large commercial developments.
(b) Guidelines for Frontage and Service Roads
(i) Frontage roads have been observed to function successfully when they serve low density trip generation activities such as residential and small office areas.
(ii) Frontage roads for retrofit situations should operate one way and should enter and leave the main lanes as merging and diverging maneuvers.
(iii) Experience has shown that when a large separation is provided between the intersection of the major road and the crossroad, and the intersection of the crossroad and the frontage road, the minimum separation is suitable only where frontage road volumes will be very low.
(iv) On a two-way frontage road, a separation of at least 300 ft (preferably more) is necessary for efficient and safe operation and that the absolute minimum is 150 ft.
(v) A minimum buffer width of 25 feet shall be required.
(vi) The reverse frontage design (Figures 13 and 14) results in a separation that allows the intersection of the frontage road and the crossroad to operate with little or
34
no adverse effect on the intersection of the major road with the crossroad.

(ii) Subdivisions, Planned Unit Developments, Site Plans, Preliminary Plats, and Final Plats shall address the following access considerations:
1) Is the road system designed to meet the projected traffic demand, and does the road network consist of hierarchy of roads designed according to function?
2) Does the road network follow the natural topography and preserve natural features of the site as much as possible? Have alignments been planned so that grading requirements are minimized?
3) Is access properly placed in relation to sight distance, driveway spacing, and other related considerations, including opportunities for joint and cross access? Are entry roads clearly visible from the major arterials?

This permit request shall be accompanied by a plan and/or drawings that demonstrate compliance with this Ordinance. The City Engineer will prescribe the construction procedure to be followed. A permit shall be required for the location of all driveways that provide for access to property. Driveway permits may also be required for any significant structure changes, land use changes, or property boundary change, wherein Section 4.01 shall apply. The driveway permit shall also be in conformance with the Columbia Municipal Code Section 16-210.
Section 4.03 RETROFITTING
