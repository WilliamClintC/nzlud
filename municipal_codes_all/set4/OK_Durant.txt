shall be reconnected only at the discretion of the city and only after payment
for water used, as estimated by the city at twice the rate otherwise
applicable, plus the cost of rerouting and repairing the service to register
accurate water use through the meter.
   (G)   Access to a water meter shall not be obstructed in any manner or
means, including access to the premises made dangerous by placement of a
vicious animal, vehicle, obstacle or obstruction, thereby preventing a meter
reader from obtaining a meter reading. In the event of obstruction, the water
use charges shall be estimated in an amount not to exceed double the average
amount of the previous year. If the customer fails to remedy the condition or
refuses to pay the estimated bill, the city shall have the right to discontinue
water service without further notice and service shall not be restored until
the obstructive causing the termination of water supply has been remedied and
all charges for water service are paid.
   (H)   Dual connections (more than one user on a single meter) to avoid
sanitary sewer charges are prohibited. Dual connections must be approved in
advance by the City Utility Department.

treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the publicly owned treatment works;
      (3)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works;
and
      (6)   To enable the city to comply with its Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is
subject.
   (C)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment
works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits;
provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes
administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established herein.

Pretreatment Department may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c).
   (C)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Pretreatment
Department shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream
formula in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
   (D)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 C.F.R. 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (E)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.15.

   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the IPD of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the IPD, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A). Employers shall ensure that all employees,
who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.6, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.091  REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the IPD as the IPD may require.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.7, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.092  NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the IPD within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the IPD within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.8, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.093  NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under
§ 53.089. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
§§ 53.085,
53.087 and
53.088.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), during a
calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous
wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R.
261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.9, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.094  ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.10, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.095  SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the IPD may authorize the
use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the
user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.11, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.096  TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.12, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.097  RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
persons) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed
the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of
such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least
three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of
any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the IPD.
(Ord. 1389, § 6.13, passed 11-12-02)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 53.110  RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The IPD shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the IPD ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
   (B)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the IPD will be permitted to enter without delay
for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (C)   The IPD shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   (D)   The IPD may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated or certified by the manufacturers' representative to ensure their
accuracy at least once a year and more often if needed.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the IPD and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the IPD access to the user's premises
shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1389, § 7.1, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.111  SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the IPD has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or
any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the IPD may seek issuance of a search warrant from the District
Court of Bryan County, Oklahoma or the United States District Court.
(Ord. 1389, § 7.2, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.112  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the IPD inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the IPD, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 C.F.R. 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
(Ord. 1389, § 8, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.113  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The IPD shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NON- COMPLIANCE shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);
      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the IPD believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the IPD exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violations, which the IPD determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 1389, § 9, passed 11-12-02)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.125  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the IPD may serve
upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 24 hours of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the IPD. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of
the IPD to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.1, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.126  CONSENT ORDERS.
   The IPD may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to
§§ 53.128 and
53.129 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.2, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.127  SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The IPD may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the IPD and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.3, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.128  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the IPD may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.4, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.129  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the IPD may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.5, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.130  ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the IPD may fine
such user in the amount of not more than $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed
on a violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the
period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 45 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 1.5% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the IPD to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 45 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
IPD may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The IPD may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.6, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.131  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The IPD may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The IPD may
also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the IPD
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The IPD may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the IPD that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in § 53.132 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the IPD prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under
§§ 53.127 or
53.132.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.7, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.132  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in
§ 53.070, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in
§§ 53.015et seq.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 53.127 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the IPD shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 1389, § 10.8, passed 11-12-02)
JUDICIAL, ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.145  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the IPD finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the IPD may
petition the District Court of Bryan County through the city's attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The IPD may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal
and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. 1389, § 11.1, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.146  CIVIL PENALTIES.

other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
   (B)   The IPD may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. 1389, § 11.2, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.147  CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (A)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per
day or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both such fine and
imprisonment.
   (B)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than $1,000 or

certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
$1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or
both such fine and imprisonment.
(Ord. 1389, § 11.3, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.148  REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The IPD may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
city's enforcement response plan. However, the IPD may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the IPD is empowered
to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 1389, § 11.4, passed 11-12-02)

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATION
§ 53.175  UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the IPD within
24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

(Ord. 1389, § 13.1, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.176  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
§ 53.015(A) or the specific prohibitions in
§ 53.015(B)(3) through (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its OPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (B)   Note: The references in this section should refer only to specific
prohibitions actually listed in the chapter. Also note that, pursuant to 40
C.F.R § 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense outlined in this section cannot
apply to the specific prohibitions in
§ 53.015(B)(1), (2), and (5).
(Ord. 1389, § 13.2, passed 11-12-02)
§ 53.177  BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the IPD, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the IPD of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The IPD may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the IPD may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The IPD may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the IPD determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in division (D)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 1389, § 13.3, passed 11-12-02)
WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES
§ 53.190  WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES.
   Any user shall be charged an excessive strength BOD and TSS surcharge if the
discharge is above the limit set forth in
§ 53.017 (225 mg/l for BOD and 200 mg/l for TSS). The surcharge for BOD in
excess of 225 mg/l shall be $0.40 per pound. The surcharge for TSS in excess of
200 mg/l shall be $0.20 per pound. These surcharges will become effective

   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting the
word “Go,” “Caution” or “Stop,” or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used, and the terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “Go.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or
turn right or left unless a sign or barricade at such place prohibits either
such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited; and
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “Stop”
signal is exhibited; and
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
sufficient time to cross the roadway and any pedestrian then starting to cross
shall yield right-of-way to all vehicles.
   (C)   Steady red alone or “Stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before
entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until green or “Go” is
shown alone. However, vehicles in the right traffic lane after making a stop as
above required may enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn
unless “No Turn on Red” signs are posted to prohibit right turns; but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian or other traffic in the
intersection, and such turn shall not be made so as to interfere with traffic
proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street; and
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “Go” is shown alone or until authorized so to do by a pedestrian
“Walk” signal.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection;
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the
green or “Go” is shown alone or until authorized so to do by pedestrian “Walk”
signal; and
      (3)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made. In the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

§ 71.105  DETERMINATION OF STOP AND YIELD INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   The City Manager, subject to direction by the Council, is authorized
to determine and designate intersections where a particular hazard exists upon
other than through streets and to determine:
      (1)   Whether vehicles shall stop at one or more entrances to any such
intersection, in which event he or she shall cause to be erected a stop sign at
every such place where a stop is required; or
      (2)   Whether vehicles shall yield the right- of-way to vehicles on a
different street at such intersection as prescribed in
§ 71.106, in which event he or she shall cause to be erected a yield sign at
every place where obedience thereto is required.
   (B)   Every stop sign and every yield sign shall be erected as near as
practicable to the nearest line of the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, then as near as practicable to the

stop if necessary and yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian legally crossing
the roadway on which he or she is driving and to any vehicle in the
intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard. If such driver is involved in a collision with a pedestrian
in a crosswalk or a vehicle in the intersection after driving past a yield
sign, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his or her failure
to yield the right-of-way.
   (B)   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign is required for
safety to stop, shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, in the event there is no crosswalk, at a clearly marked
stop line, but, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersection roadway.

(`93 Code, § 8-501)
§ 95.16  DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS, UNSECURED BUILDINGS, ABATEMENT.
   In addition to procedures outlined in this code, the City Council may cause
dilapidated buildings within the city limits to be torn down and removed, or
boarded or secured, in accordance with the following procedure:
   (A)   At least ten days' notice shall be given to the owner of the property
before the city takes action or holds a hearing as provided herein. A copy of
the notice shall be posted on the property to be affected. In addition, a copy
of the notice shall be sent by mail to the property owner at the address shown
by the current year’s tax rolls in the office of the County Treasurer. Written
notice shall also be mailed to any mortgage holder as shown by the records in
the office of the County Clerk to the last-known address of the mortgagee. At
the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee.
However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located,
notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property, or by
publication, as defined by 11 O.S. § 1-102. The notice may be published once
not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action to be taken pursuant to
this section;
   (B)   The owner of the property may give his or her written consent to the
city authorizing the removal, tearing down, dismantling or the boarding and
securing of a building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By
giving the written consent, the owner waives his or her right to a hearing by
the City Council;
   (C)   If the property owner does not give his or her written consent to such
actions, a hearing shall be held by the Council to determine whether the
property is dilapidated and has thereby become detrimental to the health,
benefit and welfare of the public and the community or creates a fire hazard to
the danger of  property or needs to be boarded and secured;
   (D)   Pursuant to a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a
detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefitted by the removal
of such conditions or by its boarding and securing, the Council may cause the
dilapidated building to be torn down and removed, or boarded and secured, and
shall fix reasonable dates for the commencement and completion of the work. The
City Clerk shall immediately file a notice of dilapidation or unsecured
building and lien with the County Clerk describing the property, the findings
of the city at the hearing and stating that the city claims a lien on the
property for the destruction and removal, boarding and securing costs and that
such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the
date of filing of the notice. The hearing may be held in conjunction with a
hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on the
premises of the building held pursuant to this chapter. In making a
determination to board and secure a building, the Council may order the
boarding and securing when the boarding and securing would make such building
less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such
building or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an
attractive nuisance to children. The agents of the city are granted the right
of entry on the property for the performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the city if the work is not performed by the property
owner within dates fixed by the Council;
   (E)   The Council shall determine the actual cost of the dismantling and
removal of dilapidated buildings, or the boarding and securing, and any other
expenses as may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the cost of
notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall forward a statement of such actual
cost attributable to the dismantling and removal or boarding and securing and a
demand for payment by mail to the property owner at the address specified in
this section. In addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed to any
mortgage holder at the address specified in this section. At the time of
mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt
shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. If
the city dismantles or removes any dilapidated buildings, or boards or secures
a building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of
the labor, maintenance and equipment required for the dismantling and removal
of the dilapidated buildings. If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated
buildings or boarding and securing is done on a private contract basis, the
contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder;
   (F)   When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city shall
file a release of lien or part thereof. But if payment is not made within six
months from the date of the mailing of the statement, the City Clerk shall
forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the County Treasurer
of the county in which the property is located. Upon receiving payment, the
City Clerk shall forward to the County Treasurer a notice of such payment and
shall direct discharge of the lien or part thereof;
   (G)   The city may designate an administrative officer or administrative
body to carry out the duties of the Council specified in this section. The
property owner shall have a right of appeal to the Council from any order of
the administrative officer or administrative body. The appeal shall be filed in
writing with the City Clerk within ten days after the administrative order is
rendered;
   (H)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned
and used for agricultural purposes;
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from otherwise abating
a dilapidated building as a nuisance or otherwise exercising its police power
to protect the public health, safety or welfare;
   (J)   The officers, employees or agents of the city shall not be liable for
any damages or loss of property due to the removal of dilapidated buildings
performed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or as otherwise prescribed
by law;
   (K)   If the City Council anticipates the need to board and secure a
building as provided in this section, the notice shall state that any
subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month
period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such
notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the city; that the costs of such
boarding and securing shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may
be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further prior
notice to the property owner or mortgage holder;
   (L)   If a City Council causes a structure within the city limits to be
boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and securing within a
six-month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be summarily boarded and
secured without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder.
At the time of each such summary boarding and securing, the city shall notify
the property owner and mortgage holder of the boarding and securing and the
costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request an
appeal with the City Clerk within ten days after the mailing of the notice. The
notice and hearing shall be as provided for in this section. Unless otherwise
determined at the hearing, the cost of such boarding and securing shall be
determined and collected as provided for in this section; and
   (M)   The City Council may determine that a building is unsecured and order
that such building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for in this
section even though such building has not been declared by the Council to be
dilapidated.

(`93 Code, § 8-407)  (Ord. 1848, passed 3-13-18)
§ 95.61  SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (A)   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be
such as to justify and even to require the City Manager or other appropriate
officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action
summarily to abate such nuisances or to reduce or suspend the danger until more
deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   (B)   The Chief of the Fire Department, the Chief of Police, the City
Attorney, the Building Inspector, the Electrical Inspector, the Plumbing
Inspector or any other officer subordinate to the City Manager may submit
through or with the consent of the City Manager to the City Council a statement
as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or
law and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The City Manager, the
Health Officer, any Councilmember or any resident or residents of the city may
submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the City Council.
   (C)   The Council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
Council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and
other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the
Council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for or to be causing the nuisance and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. The notice to the owner
and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by
a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or
addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of
the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly
jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published
in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   (D)   If the Council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the Council shall direct the City Manager to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The City Clerk shall send a statement of the cost
of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or
causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names
and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the
city collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.
(`93 Code, § 8-408)
§ 95.62  ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT.
   In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the
city may bring suit in the District Court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 O.S. § 17.
(`93 Code, § 8-409)
§ 95.63  NUISANCE UNLAWFUL.
   It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to any owner,
lessee or other person, to create or maintain a nuisance within the city or to
permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his or her control within the
city.
(`93 Code, § 8-410) 
Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.64  HEALTH NUISANCES; ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 O.S. § 1-1011, the Health Officer
shall have authority to order the owner or occupant of any private premises in
the city to remove from such premises, at his or her own expense, any source of
filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the breeding of insects or
rodents that might contribute to the transmission of disease or any other
condition adversely affecting the public health within 24 hours or within such
other time as may be reasonable, and a failure to do so shall constitute an
offense. The order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the
owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the Health
Officer or by a police officer or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual
place of abode of the owner, occupant or agent, if known and within the state.
If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant or
agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a
copy thereof on the premises or by publication in at least one issue of a
newspaper having a general circulation in the city.
   (B)   If the order is not complied with, the Health Officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the City Clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he or she is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility
service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it
is added and shall become due and payable and be subject to the same
regulations relating to delinquency in payment as the utility bill itself. If
such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost,
after certification to the City Clerk, may be collected in any manner in which
any other debt due the city may be collected.

addition to which the violator of this chapter shall be subject to a fine as
provided in § 10.99. A failure to comply and a continuance of the violation may
result in a separate offense for every day the violation is permitted to

production, possession, or other distribution of marijuana through medical
marijuana businesses supersedes state law, any certificate of compliance issued

operation of law, with no ground for appeal or other redress on behalf of the
certificate of compliance holder.

reasonable enjoyment of life and property.
      (5)   The primary use of the residential property in which marijuana is
grown for personal use shall remain at all times a residence, with legal and

to the applicant a driver’s license upon the payment of $1.25 by the applicant
to the City Clerk, which driver’s license shall expire on June 30 following the
date of issue. The driver’s license shall be carried on the person of the
driver and upon request by any police officer of the city, the license shall be
exhibited to the officer. Should the application be rejected or disapproved by
the examining board then the applicant shall have the right of appealing to the
City Council by filing with the City Clerk within three days after such
rejection or disapproval a notice in writing that he or she is appealing to the
City Council, which appeal shall then be heard by the City Council at its next
regular meeting and the findings of the City Council shall be final.

a taxicab, public liability and property damage insurance as shall protect him
or her while operating the vehicle or vehicles from claims arising out of
damages to persons or property, including bodily injury and death as a result
of the operation of the vehicle or vehicles. The insurance shall be in the form

§ 112.14  PERMITS AND LICENSES MAY BE REVOKED.
   All permits and licenses are issued on the condition that the same may be
revoked at any time by the Mayor of the city for committing any of the offenses
hereinafter specifically mentioned, the permits and licenses to be revoked for
the period of time set opposite the offense:
   (A)   For violating any laws of the state commonly known as the
Nonintoxicating Beverage, Alcoholic Beverage and/or Narcotic Acts, by any
taxicab driver, taxi stand operator or employee while on duty or the permitting
of any violation of the laws on any taxi stand premises or in any taxicab. The
permit holder shall, insofar as this provision of the ordinance is concerned,
be responsible and accountable for the acts of his or her drivers and
employees, while on duty, and therefore any violation by the driver or employee
shall be grounds for revocation of the permits. Any violation of the laws by a
driver, in addition to the other penalties herein designated, shall be grounds
for suspending or revoking the driver’s license for a period of not less than
30 days. A conviction of any violation of the laws in a state court of record
shall be prima facie proof of the violation of the laws. The permit shall be
revoked for six months after a first offense and completely revoked after the
second offense;
   (B)   The operation of a taxicab or taxi stand by a person other than the
one to whom the permit was issued and his or her employees and licensed drivers
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter for which the permit shall be
revoked. It is the intention of the Council that only the permit holder shall
be authorized to conduct the taxicab business and any operation of the business
through a “straw man” shall be deemed an attempt to circumvent this chapter
punishable by revocation of all permits by the person held. It is the intention
of the Council that the permit holder shall himself or herself actively manage
and conduct the business for which the permit is issued;
   (C)   For wrongfully using the permit in a taxicab not having proper license
tags or motor vehicle not properly listed with City Clerk, the permit shall be
revoked for a period of 30 days;
   (D)   To use the permit in motor vehicle operated by an unlicensed driver or
chauffeur, the permit shall be revoked for a period of 30 days;
   (E)   For failure to renew the permit on or before the expiration date
thereon shall be grounds for the cancellation of the same and a refusal to
issue a new permit;
   (F)   For failure to display permit while operating a taxicab, the permit
shall be suspended for 30 days; or
   (G)   For violation of the transfer ordinance of the city while driving a
taxicab, the permit shall be suspended not to exceed 30 days.
(`93 Code, § 16-214)
§ 112.15  MAYOR TO NOTIFY VIOLATOR; HEARING TO BE HELD; RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (A)   Upon accusation having been made that a permit holder of licenses has
violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the City Manager or his or her
designee shall notify the offender, orally or in writing, and hearing shall be
set down upon reasonable notice. Hearing shall be held by the City Manager or
his or her designee. For the purpose of the hearing, the City Manager or his or
her designee is herewith authorized to compel them to produce any books or
records by them maintained in conjunction with the business by them operated,
and a failure to comply with such orders shall of and in itself be grounds for
revocation of the permits or licenses, as the case may be.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the ruling of the City Manager or his or her
designee shall have a right to appeal to the Council by filing a written notice
with the City Clerk within ten days from the ruling of the City Manager or his
or her designee of his or her intention to do so. Upon an appeal having thus
been lodged, the Council shall, at its next regular Council meeting, hear the
matter de novo and shall enter such order or orders as are just and proper.

within the limits of the city shall have been completed for production of oil
and/or gas, or within six months after the same shall have been completed in
cases where the same is abandoned for the reason that a dry hole is found, the
slush pit shall have any deleterious substances removed and be filled with dirt
and leveled off.
   (B)   All earthen pits shall be above the 100-year floodplain or properly
diked above the 100-year floodplain with a dike which is sufficient to repel
floodwater. Prior to the commencement of any drilling operation, an artificial
barrier shall be constructed completely around the well site no closer than 50
feet from the well bore. The top of the artificial portion of the barrier to be
constructed down drainage from the well shall be level at all points at a
height of no less than two feet above the ground level at the well bore in
order that any deleterious matter from the well would be trapped and stored
before such matter can enter the drainage off the well site. An adequate
diversion ditch or dike shall be constructed across and around the uphill edge
of the well site so that no surface drainage water can enter the area of the
well location.
   (C)   Any valve in the barrier shalt be kept closed at all times. Any fluid
trapped within the well site shall be pumped into steel tanks for storage and
removal. The gate in the barrier may be temporarily opened under supervised
conditions for rainwater drainage, and then only if it can be demonstrated that
such rainwater has not been contaminated with oil, chemicals, salt or any other
deleterious substances.
   (D)   Reserve pits shall be constructed.  As an alternative, drilling mud
operations may be conducted in steel tanks and the barrier which shall be
removed from the property immediately upon completion of the well.

§ 151.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.  The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has
in (statutes) 82 O.S. §§1601-1618, as amended, Chapter 23 delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, The City of Durant does ordain as follows:
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses.  In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  For the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
fioodplain management purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
fioodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.  A manufactured home park or

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  (For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE.  A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of  restoring the structure to it’s before-damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage”,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
VARIANCE, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10)
or (d)(3) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation
is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION.  The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum  (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-
made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.

Floodplain Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A and AE on the Bryan County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city.
      (10)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations, the City of Durant may approve certain
development in Zones A or AE on the community’s FIRM which increases the water
surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the
city first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (conditional
letter of map revision).
      (11)   Become accredited by the Board in accordance with Title 82 O.S. §§
1601-1618, as amended.

drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
         (e)   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
division (B)(1) of this section.
      (2)   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Fioodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (b)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (c)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (d)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (e)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (f)   the costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         (g)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         (h)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (i)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         (j)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area; and
         (k)   Compensatory storage as to the expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters within a
floodway, fioodplain or any other location that may have expected flood waters.
   (D)   Variances.
      (1)   General provisions.
         (a)   The Floodplain Board may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or these
regulations, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that (i)
compliance with these regulations will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable
taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people and
(ii) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this division (D). However, provided
no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit
the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
         (b)   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Fioodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the state.
         (c)   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
20 years.
         (d)   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the
city, accompanied by a filing fee.
         (e)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (C)(2) and provisions
of division (D) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         (f)   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the
base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Durant Floodplain
Administrator which states that (i) the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to
be built lower than the base flood elevation, and (ii) such construction below
the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
         (g)   At such time as the Floodplain Administrator deems the petition
ready for notification to the public, the Floodplain Administrator shall
schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in Bryan County and a newspaper of general
circulation in Bryan County at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
         (h)   The Floodplain Administrator shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this division
(D). The Floodplain Administrator shall exercise wide discretion in weighing
the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and
to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
         (i)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances;
and
            4.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         (j)   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this division (D)
and the intent of these regulations, the Floodplain Administrator may attach
such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further
the purposes and objectives stated in §
151.01(C).
         (k)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the city shall be sent by the Floodplain Administrator to
the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the variance.
      (2)   Special provisions.
         (a)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of these regulations.
         (b)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         (c)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         (d)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
            1.   The criteria of divisions (D)(1)(e), (D)(1)(i), (D)(2)(b), and
(D)(2)(c) of this section are met; and
            2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.

§ 151.05  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) §
151.03(B), (ii) §
151.04(B)(8), or (iii) §
151.03(C)(3), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), shall be elevated a minimum of two foot above the base flood
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor
shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard
of this division as proposed in §
151.04(C)(1), is satisfied.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated a
minimum of two (2) foot above the base flood level. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division as proposed in §
151.04(C)(2), is satisfied.
      (3)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   Manufactured homes.
         (a)   Require that all manufactured homes allowed to be placed within
the city in its Zone A or AE areas as shown on the Bryan County FIRM shall be
installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the
purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated so that the
bottom of the I-Beam shall be elevated a minimum of two foot above the base
flood elevation and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
An elevation certificate is required to be provided to the floodplain
administrator to verify this requirement has been met.
         (b)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zone AE on the community’s FIRM on sites (i) outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the I-Beam
of the manufactured home shall be elevated a minimum of two foot above the base
flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. An elevation
certificate is required to be provided to the floodplain administrator to
verify this requirement has been met.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A and AE on the Bryan County FIRM either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         (c)   Meet the permit requirements of §
151.04(C)(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured
homes” in division (B)(4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
      (6)   Accessory structure.
         (a)   Structure is low valued and represents a minimal investment.
         (b)   Structure shall be small and not exceed 600 square feet in size.
         (c)   Structure shall be unfinished on the interior.
         (d)   Structure can be used only for parking and limited storage.
         (e)   Structure shall not be used for human habitation (including
work, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas).
         (f)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment must
be elevated to or above the BFE or floodproofed.
         (g)   Structure is constructed and placed on building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (h)   Structure is designed to have low flood damage potential i.e.
constructed with flood resistance materials.
         (i)   Structure is firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
         (j)   Floodway requirements must be met in the construction of the
structure.
         (k)   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below the BFE.
         (l)   Structure is to be located so as not to cause damage to adjacent
and nearby structures.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §
151.01(B), (C) and (D).
      (2)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of §
151.03(C), §
151.04(C); and the provisions of §
151.05.
      (3)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to §
151.03(B) or §
151.04(B)(8) of this chapter.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
   (D)   Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in §
151.03(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply.
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If §
151.05(C)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of §
151.05.
      (3)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM
and floodway revision through FEMA.
(Ord. 1622, passed 8-11-09)
§ 151.99  PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in §
10.99. Any person who violates or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be punished as provided in §
10.99. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

§ 152.23  DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the following standards is to provide the
Durant Municipal Planning Commission and the City Council with standards to
guide their review of the design elements in a proposed development plan for a
new manufactured housing development.
   (B)   General design standards.  The development plan for a manufactured
housing (land-lease) development shall be studied to determine whether the
proposed site development plan meets the requirements of this chapter and the
following:
      (1)   Each site development plan should be laid out and developed as a
complete unit, in accordance with an integrated overall design;
      (2)   The location for buildings, parking areas, walks, lighting and
appurtenant facilities should be arranged to be compatible with surrounding
land uses. Any part of the site not used for buildings, other structures,
parking, roads, accessways or recreation purposes should be landscaped with
grass, trees and/or shrubs;
      (3)   There should be sufficient private open space in each lot to ensure
that each resident has an adequate amount of light, air and privacy;
      (4)   Parking areas should be arranged to be safe and conveniently
accessible from streets internal to the development;
      (5)   The street pattern should serve, not shape, the lots in the
development. Minor streets should feed at well spaced intervals into collector
arterial streets. Streets should intersect at 90 degree angles;
      (6)   A site development plan which conforms to and preserves terrain,
trees, shrubs and rock formations is highly preferred;
      (7)   The Planning and Zoning Commission should determine that the
proposed site development plan is consistent with good planning practice,
consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan, can be developed in a manner
that is not detrimental to permitted uses in the surrounding area and is
designed to promote the general welfare of the city.
(Ord. 1287, passed 8-10-99)
§ 152.24  SITE DEVELOPMENT PLANS REVIEW.
   (A)   Site plan review by Planning Commission and City Council.  Prior to
approval of a permit by the Building Official for the construction of a new
manufactured housing development or expansion of an existing mobile home park,
a site plan shall be reviewed and recommended for approval by the Durant
Municipal Planning Commission then accepted and approved by the Durant City
Council.
   (B)   Conditions. In approving the site plans for manufactured housing
developments, the Planning Commission and City Council shall determine that
adequate provisions are made for the following:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic to and from the development as well as traffic
internal to the development, including adequate access for emergency vehicles
and personnel, postal service and other public and private services and
individuals who may require access to the premises;
      (2)   Pedestrian traffic to and from the proposed manufactured home
sites, common facilities and parking areas on the premises;
      (3)   Common recreation areas, including any needed screening or
landscaping;
      (4)   Utilities which meet the standards set forth herein;
      (5)   A storm-water runoff system, allowing for safe and efficient
drainage throughout the manufactured home development and preventing the
impairment of or negative impact to any off-site property.
   (C)   Final development plan.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, a final development plan must first be reviewed and approved by the
planning staff, Planning Commission and City Council. Upon receipt of approval
for the final development plan, said plan shall be recorded with the Community
Development Department of the City of Durant and filed of record in the Bryan
County Clerk’s Office. In addition, the corners of all manufactured home spaces
shall be clearly marked on the ground with iron stakes.

§ 152.49  STANDARDS FOR DETERMINATION OF EXTERIOR SIMILARITY AND/OR
COMPATIBILITY.
   The following standards shall be used in determinations of similarity and/or
compatibility in appearance between a manufactured home (with foundations
approved as provided in this subsection) and site-built housing which has been
constructed in adjacent or nearby locations.
   (A)   Minimum width of main body.  Minimum width of the main body of the
manufactured home shall not be less than 20 feet, as measured across the
narrowest portion of the house. This is not intended to prohibit the offsetting
of portions of the home.
   (B)   Minimum roof pitch; minimum roof overhang; roofing materials.  Minimum
pitch of the main roof shall be not less than 3 feet of rise for each 12 feet
of horizontal run (3:12), and minimum roof overhang shall be 1 foot. In cases
where site built housing generally has been constructed in adjacent or nearby
locations with lesser roof pitches and/or roof overhangs of less than 1 foot,
then a manufactured home may have less roof pitch and overhang, similar to the
site-built houses. Any roofing material other than a built up composition roof
may be used if it is generally used for site-build houses in adjacent or nearby
locations.
   (C)   Exterior finish; light reflection.  Only material for exterior finish
which is generally acceptable for site-built housing which has been constructed
in adjacent or nearby locations may be used, provided, however, that reflection
for such exterior shall not be greater than from siding coated with clean white
gloss exterior enamel.
   (D)   Approved foundations required in residential districts.  No
manufactured home shall be placed or occupied for residential use on a site in
a residential district until such foundation plans have been submitted to and
approved by the Building Official or his or her designee as to the appearance
and durability of the proposed foundation and being acceptably similar or
compatible in appearance to foundations of residences built on adjacent or
nearby sites. Every manufactured home shall, at a minimum be placed on a
permanent foundation and have the wheels and other transporting devices removed
prior to such placement. In order to be administratively approved for
installation on a R-2 or R-3 residential lot a manufactured home must be placed
on a continuous perimeter, permanent foundation wall (stem wall or approved
masonry wall) with concrete footings as indicated in the figure below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-6014.jpg]
 
   (E)   Site orientation of the manufactured home.  Manufactured homes shall
be placed on lots in such a manner as to be compatible with and reasonably
similar in orientation to the site-built housing which has been constructed in
adjacent or nearby locations.
   (F)   Garages and/or carports.  In residential neighborhoods where adjacent
or nearby site-built homes include garages and/or carports, a manufactured home
must have a garage or carport. A manufactured home shall be required to be
provided with a garage and/or carport compatible with the manufactured home and
the site-built garages and/or carports constructed in adjacent or nearby
locations.
   (G)   Compatibility with adjacent or nearby site-built housing.  In order
for the Building Official to approve a building permit for the installation of
a manufactured home in an existing residential district the proposed
manufactured home shall be compared to site-built housing in the neighborhood
within the same zoning district. Approval for the installation of a
manufactured home shall not be granted by the Building Official unless it is
found that the subject manufactured home is substantially similar in size,
siding, material, roof pitch, roof material, foundation and general appearance
to site-built housing which may be permitted by the zoning and/or building code
in the neighborhood in the same zoning district.

bond with the City Clerk to guarantee recovery of the antenna support structure
and antenna removal costs. The amount of the bond shall be 100% surety and
sufficient to cover one and one-half times the entire cost, as estimated by the
engineer, of the removal of the abandoned antenna support structure and
antenna. The term of the bond shall be for the expected life of the antenna
support structure and antenna.
(Ord. 1298, passed 1-11-00)
§ 154.08  APPLICATION AND PERMIT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ANTENNA AND ANTENNA
SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Ownership.  The applicant for a building permit to construct a
telecommunications tower or antenna must be the owner of the property or his or
her legal agent or possess a signed and legally notarized statement from the
property owner indicating his or her consent. Any leased area must be large
enough to accommodate the tower or antenna and support facilities and include
access to a public street or accessible parking area. Purchase or ownership of
a separate parcel may require platting and improvements before construction
permits can be issued.
   (B)   Site plan.  Prior to the issuance of a building permit a site plan
shall be submitted by the applicant to the Building Official in such a manner
as will satisfy all of the following requirements:
      (1)   No antenna support structure or antenna, microwave reflector/
antenna or associated foundations, anchors or support wires may be located
within any required front, side or rear yard or closer than five feet to any
property line;
      (2)   Access to an antenna support structure and related facilities or
buildings must be through a locked gate with the antenna support structure
equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device;
      (3)   Any antenna support structure and related facilities or buildings
must be similar in color and character to the main or adjoining building or
structure or blend with the landscaping and other surroundings in the immediate
vicinity to the extent practical. The antenna support structure and the related
facilities or buildings shall be enclosed by a screen eight feet in height,
using a chain link or wrought iron fence with an evergreen hedge or a totally
opaque screening fence or a masonry wall. This enclosure shall be paved or
graveled and kept weed-free. Equipment or vehicles not necessary for direct
support of the use shall not be stored or parked on the site unless repairs to
the facility are being made or unless the zoning district permits such a
storage use;
      (4)   The antenna support structure shall be erected and operated in
compliance with current Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation
Administration rules and regulations and other applicable federal and state
standards;
      (5)   A commercially used antenna support structure must be:
         (a)   Used by two or more broadcast/ reception services; or
         (b)   Designed and built so as to be capable of use by two or more
broadcast/reception services while allowing no more than three degrees of twist
and sway at the top elevation. The owner of the antenna support structure must
certify to the city that the antenna is available for use by another broadcast/
reception service on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis at a cost not
exceeding the market value for the use of the facilities, provided space is
available at the time of the request;
      (6)   No lettering, symbols, images or trademarks large enough to be
legible from any public street shall be placed on or affixed to any part of an
antenna support structure, antenna array or antenna other than as required by
FCC regulations regarding tower registration or other applicable law. No
commercial advertising, signage or flag shall be allowed on any antenna support
structure. This shall not prevent the joint use of a legal existing sign
structure in an appropriate zoning district as a support mechanism for an
antenna;
      (7)   The need for the antenna support structure at the proposed site
shall be documented as a part of the site plan, including an assessment of the
existing antenna support structures in the vicinity of the city, noting why
existing structures are unsuitable or unavailable;
      (8)   Antenna support structures should be constructed to minimize
potential safety hazards. Antenna support structures and antennae shall be
constructed so as to meet or exceed the most recent  EIA-222 standards. Prior
to issuance of a building permit the Building Official shall be provided with
an engineer’s certification that the tower’s design meets or exceeds those
standards. All antenna support structures shall be located in such a manner
that if the structure should fall along its longest dimension, it will remain
within property boundaries and avoid residential structures, public streets,
utility lines and any other antenna support structure;
      (9)   Antenna support structures, antennae and related facilities and
buildings shall be located to minimize their number, height and obtrusiveness
in order to minimize visual impacts on the surrounding area and in accordance
with the following policies:
         (a)   Ensure that the height of antenna support structures and
antennae has the least visual impact and is no greater than required to achieve
service area requirements and potential collocation;
         (b)   Demonstrate that the selected site for a new antenna support
structure provides the least visual impact on residential areas and the public
rights-of-way. Analyze the potential impacts from other vantage points in the
area to illustrate that the selected site provides the best opportunity to
minimize the visual impact of the proposed facility. The antenna support
structure and antenna should be obscured by vegetation, tree cover, topographic
features and buildings or other structures to the maximum extent feasible. All
landscaping requirements of the particular zoning district shall be complied
with fully. If security lighting is installed, such light shall be directed
into the site and only triggered by motion detectors. Any related unmanned
equipment building shall not contain more than 750 square feet of gross floor
area and shall not be more than 12 feet in height;
         (c)   Historically significant landscapes shall be protected. The view
of and vistas from architecturally and/or historically significant structures
should not be impaired or diminished by the placement of antenna support
structures or antennae;
         (d)   The Planning Commission may recommend a variance and the Council
may grant a variance to a requirement for an antenna support structure when it
is determined that such a variance better accomplishes the policies set out in
this chapter than would a strict application of the requirement. Such variance,
however, shall be no greater than necessary to accomplish the policies
established herein;
      (10)   No signals or lights or illumination shall be permitted on an
antenna support structure unless required by the Federal Communications
Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration or the city;
      (11)   If any additions, changes or modifications are to be made to the
antenna support structure, the Building Official shall have the authority to
require proof, through the submission of engineering and structural data, that
the addition, change or modification conforms to structural wind load and all
other requirements of the current building code adopted by the city;
      (12)   To enable the Building Official, Planning Commission and/or City
Council to access the visual impact of the proposed antenna support structure
and antenna, the applicant shall submit color photo simulations showing the
proposed site with a photo-realistic representation of the proposed structure
as it would appear viewed from the closest residential property or from 1/
4 mile in the direction of the nearest residentially zoned property, whichever
distance is less. The applicant shall also submit photographs of the same views
showing the current appearance of the site, without the proposed antenna
support structure and antenna;
      (13)   The antenna support structure complies with all ordinances of the
city not in conflict with this chapter;
      (14)   Any antenna support structure legally erected prior to January 11,
2000 can be extended upward to accommodate additional antennae so long as the
total height limitation of this chapter is not exceeded and permitting
requirements of this chapter are met;
      (15)   In addition to the usual application fee for a request for a
change in zoning, the applicant shall reimburse the city for the reasonable,
actual cost to the city for the services of an engineer should one be required
to review the application and provide engineering expertise;
      (16)   In order to minimize visual impacts that can result from the
presence of antenna support structures, such structures and associated
facilities may not exceed 200 feet in height. Monopole construction, free of
guy-wire support systems, is encouraged whenever feasible. Compliance with all
requirements of the building code, including an engineer’s structural
certification of the antenna support structure, must be demonstrated before a
construction permit can be issued;
      (17)   No commercial antenna support structure shall be located closer
than 200 feet to the boundary line of any property zoned or used for any
residential purpose. All antenna support structures shall observe a minimum
setback from any abutting street right-of-way equal to the combined height of
the support structure and attached antennae. An exception may be granted by the
Building Official or the City Council where engineering documents indicate that
the tower design will assure that a collapsing tower will fall within a smaller
area. Under no circumstances, however, may a free standing antenna support
structure be located closer than 50 feet from the abutting street right-of-way.
Setbacks from residentially zoned property do not apply to antennas attached to
public utility structures exceeding 75 feet in height or to antennas placed
wholly within a building;
      (18)   To minimize their proliferation, all reasonable efforts should be
made to co-locate facilities on existing or new antenna support structures;
      (19)   An antenna may be placed wholly within any building legally
permitted in a commercial, industrial or health facilities district or in any
publicly-owned building;
      (20)   An antenna may be mounted flush to the exterior of buildings in a
commercial, industrial or health facilities zoned district if painted and
integrated into the overall architectural design. An antenna may be attached to
any utility structures (such as a water tower or electrical transmission tower)
or public building not located in a street right-of-way, if the property is
owned by a government or public agency;
      (21)   In the Main Street District no antenna may extend above the
building on which it is mounted unless it is made to appear as a part of the
building and integrated into the overall architectural design;
      (22)   Except in the Main Street District a roof-mounted non-whip antenna
may extend ten feet above the building, provided that the antenna and
supporting equipment is fully screened from view at street level;
      (23)   Except in the Main Street District a whip antenna may be mounted
on the roof of a nonresidential building or structure, provided it does not
exceed the height of the building by more than ten feet and it is located no
closer to the perimeter of the building than its height above the roof;
      (24)   Antenna support structures and antennae of more than ten feet in
height are prohibited within residentially zoned districts. The structures are
allowed by right within the I-l and I-2 zoning districts;
      (25)   Satellite and microwave dishes attached to antenna support
structures shall not exceed four feet in diameter or six feet in diameter if
attached to a lattice tower;
      (26)   All transmitting antennae, microwave dishes and related equipment
shall transmit with low wattage transmitters not to exceed 500 watts per
channel.
(Ord. 1298, passed 1-11-00)
§ 154.09  SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   An antenna support structure or antenna shall not be constructed or used
within the city without all approvals and permits first having been secured.
The Building Official shall approve or reject the site plan within 30 days of
the zoning application being approved by the City Council. If applicable, or of
the date of submittal of the site plan by applicant, whichever last occurs. In
the event the site plan as originally submitted is incomplete, the 30-day
review period does not commence until the Building Official determines the site
plan, as amended, to be administratively complete.
(Ord. 1298, passed 1-11-00)
§ 154.10  ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND ANTENNA MOUNTED ON EXISTING
STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Building-mounted antennas of the non-whip type are allowed on
nonresidential buildings and structures, provided the antenna is mounted flush
with the exterior of the building so that it projects no more than 30 inches
from the surface of the building to which it is attached and the antenna’s
appearance is such as to blend with the surrounding surface of the building.
   (B)   Associated equipment shall be placed either within the same building
or in a separate building which matches the existing building in character and
building materials or blends with the landscaping and other surroundings
immediately adjacent to the separate building housing the equipment. Associated
equipment for roof-mounted antennas may be located on the roof of the building
if it is not visible from the street.
   (C)   Before the Building Official may issue a building permit and at the
time of application for a building permit to locate an antenna support
structure or antenna on an existing building or other structure, the Building
Official shall be provided with color photo simulations showing the site of the
existing structure with a photo-realistic representation of both the proposed
support structure and the existing structure or any proposed reconstruction of
the structure as it would appear viewed from the closest residential property
or from a distance of 1/4 mile in the direction of the nearest residentially
zoned property, whichever distance is less. The applicant shall also submit
photographs of the same views showing the current appearance of the site
without the proposed construction.
   (D)   Before the Building Official may issue a building permit and at the
time of application for a building permit to locate an antenna support
structure or antenna on an existing building or other structure, the Building
Official shall be provided with an engineer certification that the roof and/or
other support structure will support the proposed antenna and all associated
equipment.

§ 155.03  AIRPORT ZONES.
   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to Eaker Field.  Such zones are shown on the
Airport Airspace Drawings, sheets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, prepared by Barnard
Dunkelberg and Company and dated August 1999, which are hereby expressly
incorporated herein and made a part hereof.  An area located in more than one
of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation.
   (B)   The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone.  The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500
feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface.  Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway (runway 12-30).
      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/
4 mile non-precision instrument approach zone.  The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. 
The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface.  Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway (runway 17).
      (3)   Precision instrument runway approach zone.  The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface.  Its centerline
is the continuation of the centerline of the runway (runway 35 planned).
      (4)   Transitional zones.  The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
      (5)   Horizontal zone.  The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and
10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface
of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to
those arcs.  The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional
zones.
      (6)   Conical zone.  The conical zone is established as the area that

   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be
erected, altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
      (1)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone.  Slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
along the extended runway centerline (runway 12-30).
      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/
4 mile non-precision instrument approach zone.  Slopes 34 feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline (runway 17).
      (3)   Precision instrument runway approach zone.  Slopes 50 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each
foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline (runway 35 planned).
      (4)   Transitional zones.  Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 848 feet above mean sea level.  In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. 
Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical
zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90
degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
      (5)   Horizontal zone.  Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at a height of 848 feet above mean sea level.
      (6)   Conical zone.  Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the
airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport
elevation.
   (B)   Excepted height limitations.  Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or
growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
(`93 Code, § 12-704)  (Ord. passed 10-21-74; Am. Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-04)
§ 155.05  USE RESTRICTION.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(`93 Code, § 12-705)  (Ord. passed 10-21-74; Am. Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-04)
§ 155.06  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive.  The regulations prescribed in this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
November 9, 2004 or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction,
alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which was begun prior to November 9, 2004, and is diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting.  Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction.  Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the city.
(`93 Code, § 12-706)  (Ord. passed 10-21-74; Am. Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-04)
§ 155.07  PERMITS AND FEES.
   (A)   Future uses.  Except as specifically provided in divisions  (1), (2)
and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted upon the prior payment of the appropriate permit fees
to be established from time to time. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.  No permit
for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with division (D) of this
section.
      (1)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain,
land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      (2)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
      (3)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition
zones.
      (4)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in § 155.04.
   (B)   Existing uses.  No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
November 9, 2004 or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application
for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit
shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed.  Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances.  Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations.  The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.  Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not be an airport
hazard or create a hazard to air navigation,  will do substantial justice and
will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.  Additionally, the Board
of Adjustment may consider no application for variance to the requirements of
this chapter unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Joint
Airport Zoning Board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance.  If the Joint Airport Zoning Board does not respond to the
application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on
its own to grant or deny said application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting.  Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at
the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.  If deemed
proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the city at its own expense to install, operate and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.
(`93 Code, § 12-707)  (Ord. passed 10-21-74; Am. Ord. 1447, passed 11-9-04)
§ 155.08  ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce
the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall
be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form created for that purpose.
Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application
for action by the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the
Zoning Administrator.

§ 155.11  [RESERVED].
§ 155.12  PENALTIES AND REMEDIES.
   Each violation of this chapter or of any regulation, order or ruling
promulgated hereunder shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by
a fine of not more than $500 and each day a violation continues to exist shall
constitute a separate offense.  In addition, the political subdivisions
adopting the regulations contained in this chapter or the Joint Airport Zoning
Board may institute an action to prevent, restrain, correct or abate any
violation of this chapter and its regulations or of any order or ruling made in
connection with their administration or enforcement in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

§ 155.13  CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees
and the use of land or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or
requirement shall govern and prevail.

shown in a sketch plat has not been filed with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission within two years of the date of approval of the sketch plat, then
all approvals shall be void and the land owner shall have no rights or
privileges based upon the former approval.
   (B)   Preliminary plats.  The applicant shall submit to the Community
Development Department four copies of the preliminary plat and one copy of the
preliminary plat checklist 15 days before the Planning Commission meeting at
which consideration is requested. At the option of the applicant, a preliminary
plat may be submitted without the necessary improvement plans with a request
for conditional approval from the Planning Commission. After the granting of a
conditional approval of such a partial submission of a preliminary plat, the
applicant shall submit the necessary improvement plans within six months. If
the improvement plans are not submitted within six months, all conditional
approvals shall be void. The Planning Commission shall act upon all submissions
related to the preliminary plats within 75 days of the receipt of materials or
the plat shall be considered to have been approved. If a final plat covering
all or part of the land shown in a preliminary plat has not been filed with the
Community Development Department within two years after the approval of the
preliminary plat, then all approvals shall be void.
   (C)   Final plats.  The applicant shall submit to the Community Development
Department four copies of the final plat and two copies of the as-built plans
for all improvements installed 15 days before the Planning Commission meeting
at which consideration is requested. The Planning Commission shall act upon all
submissions related to final plats within 75 days of the date of receipt of
materials or the plat shall be considered to have been approved. If a final
plat is not filed of record with the County Clerk within six months after the
approval of the Planning Commission and City Council, then all approvals shall
be void.

§ 156.025  VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in these regulations would result in
substantial hardship or inequity, the Planning Commission may vary or modify,
except as otherwise indicated, such requirements of design, but not of
procedure or improvements, so that the subdivider may develop his or her
property in a reasonable manner, but so, at the same time, that the public
welfare and interests of the city are protected and that the general intent and
spirit of these regulations be preserved. Such modification may be granted upon
written request of the subdivider stating the reasons for each modification and
such action shall be taken by the affirmative vote of 3/4 of the regular
membership of the Planning Commission and confirmed by a simple majority vote
of the City Council.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.026  SURETY BOND.
   In lieu of filing a surety bond the subdivider or developer may secure and
place on deposit with the city an irrevocable letter of credit or comparable
instrument from a title company, banking institution or similar financial
institution, stating that money will be held in escrow until all offsite
improvements have been completed to the city's satisfaction. Such letter of
credit or financial instrument shall be drawn in favor of the city for the
entire cost of improvements for water mains, paving, sanitary sewers, storm
sewers and other drainage facilities as estimated by the subdividers registered
professional engineer and approved by the City Engineer. The Building
Inspection Department, a division of the Community Development Department shall

plat, preliminary plat, or final plat as provided in these regulations, the
property owner may petition the Planning Commission to extend or reinstate the
approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting of the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   In determining whether to grant such requests, the Planning Commission
shall take into account the reasons for the lapse, the ability of the property
owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval and the
extent to which newly adopted subdivision regulations shall apply to the plat.
The Planning Commission shall extend or reinstate the plat, or deny the
request, in which instance the properly owner must submit a new application for
approval.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may extend or reinstate the approval subject
to additional conditions based upon newly enacted regulations or such as are
necessary to assure compliance with the original conditions of approval. The
Planning Commission may also specify a shorter time for lapse of the extended
or reinstated plat than is applicable to original approvals.
   (D)   The approval of a preliminary plat for a portion or phase of a sketch
plat, or the approval of a final plat for a portion or phase of a preliminary
plat, shall not automatically affect the expiration of approval of the sketch
plat or preliminary plat as it pertains to the balance of the property.
Extensions and reinstatement of a sketch plat, preliminary plat, or final plat
may be approved under the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)

Planning Commission and may, where appropriate, remand the plat or variance
request to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with City
Council's decision.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
PLATTING PROCEDURES
§ 156.040  GENERAL.
   (A)   Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any contract is
made for the sale of any part of the land, the owner of the land or his or her
agent shall apply for and secure the approval of the Planning Commission and
the City Council of such proposed subdivision. The proposed subdivision may be
processed as a standard subdivision or as a lot-split subdivision as follows:
      (1)   Standard subdivision:
         (a)   Sketch plat;
         (b)   Preliminary plat (and construction plans for improvements);
         (c)   Final plat:
         (d)   Building permit.  Building permits may be issued by the
Community Development Director only after the preliminary plat has been
approved by the Planning Commission and City Council;
         (e)   Occupancy permit.  Certificate of occupancy may be issued by the
Community Development Director only after the structure(s) comply with the
requirements of the International Residential Code and/or the International
Building Code and a preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning
Commission and City Council;
      (2)   Lot-split (as required).
   (B)   Upon initial receipt of a subdivision proposal, the Community
Development Director shall determine if the proposal shall be classified as a
standard subdivision or a lot-split. If a subdivision is determined to be a
lot-split, the Community Development Director shall determine what information,
drawings and procedure will be necessary for the submission of the lot-split to
the Planning Commission in accordance with these regulations and the policies
of the Planning Commission. The Community Development Director, shall consider
in each case the nature of a proposed lot-split and the relationship of the
proposal to surrounding land uses, topography, property shape, property size,
adjacent ownership, public access and public facilities in order to determine
the extent to which the platting process must be followed. The above
determinations of the Community Development Director may be reviewed and
revised by the Planning Commission, and then the City Council upon request of
the subdivider.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07; Am. Ord. 1671, passed 11-14-11)
§ 156.041  CLASSIFICATION OF SUBDIVISIONS AND ADDITION AS MINOR OR MAJOR.
   (A)   Before any land is platted, the property owner shall apply for and
secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat or addition plat in accordance
with the following procedures, unless otherwise provided by these regulations.
Subdivisions are classified as major or minor depending on the number of lots
proposed and the extent of public improvements required.
      (1)   Minor subdivisions shall create no more than four lots and do not
require the creation of a new street or the extension of municipal facilities.
Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential
properties. Conveyance plats may be approved under the procedure for minor
subdivisions provided that they establish no more than four lots and do not
create a new street or extend municipal facilities. Minor plat approval
requires the submission of a final plat as described under these regulations,
or the submission of a conveyance plat as described under these regulations.
The Community Development Director may approve minor plats or refer them to the
Planning Commission for their action.
      (2)   Major subdivisions involve the creation of new streets, the
extension of municipal facilities or the creation of more than four lots. Major
subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential properties.
Conveyance plats are considered major subdivisions if they create more than
four lots or involve the creation of new streets or the extension of municipal
facilities. The procedure for approving a major plat typically requires three
steps: sketch plat, preliminary plat, and final plat. Sketch plats require
approval by the Planning Commission. The sketch plat requirement may be omitted
if the subdivision creates no more than one new street and the Community
Development Director determines that sufficient information exist to begin
preparation of a preliminary plat. A concept plan or preliminary site plan that
contains sufficient information to provide for the proper coordination of the
development may be required for nonresidential property.
   (B)   Except as otherwise permitted, the Planning Commission's approval of a
preliminary plat is required prior to the construction of public improvements
to the property. The preliminary plat and the associated engineering plans for
the property may be amended during construction, with only major changes
requiring reapproval by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Upon completion of the required public improvements, or the provision
of a subdivision improvement agreement described in these regulations, the
owner may submit a corrected final plat for the subdivision. Lots may be sold
and building permits obtained after approval of the plat by the Planning
Commission, and filing of the signed plat. The preliminary plat process may be
omitted if the owner enters into a subdivision improvement agreement with the
city and provides sufficient surety for all proposed public improvements. If
the preliminary plat process is omitted, engineering plans must be submitted in
conjunction with the final plat.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.042  SKETCH PLAT.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the sketch plat is to provide the subdivider,
the Planning Commission and the governing bodies an opportunity to identify any
problems concerning the land use, general design and overall approaches to
installation of improvements before the expenditure of large amounts of money
and manpower in the preparation of more detailed platting documents. This step
in the overall subdivision process is very important because it is at the
initial part of the process when decisions are to be made that can have great
value from the fulfillment of the Comprehensive Plan; or, conversely decisions
wrongly made at this point can be very damaging to the fulfillment of the
Comprehensive Plan. It is important that all of the land to be included in the
proposed subdivision shall be included in the sketch plat so that an overview
of an entire area can be accomplished.
   (B)   Before preparing the sketch plat, the subdivider should review these
regulations and discuss with the Community Development Director the procedures
for the adoption of a subdivision plat and the general requirements as to the
layout of streets and for any reservations of land, street improvements,
drainage, sewerage, water supply, fire protection, the availability of services
and similar matters.
   (C)   Applicability.  A sketch plat shall be required as a condition
precedent to approval of any application for a major plat, except where the
Community Development Director determines:
      (1)   The subdivision will result in no more than one new street and
sufficient information exists to begin preparation of a preliminary plat; or
      (2)   A concept plan, preliminary site plan or final site plan for the
property provides sufficient information for the preparation of a preliminary
plat.
   (D)   Phasing of development.  The Commission may permit a sketch plat for a
major plat to be divided into two or more phases, as indicated on the sketch
plat, provided each phase satisfies the requirements of this chapter. In
considering phasing of a sketch plat, the Commission may approve certain
conditions as it deems necessary to assure the orderly development of the
platted land. Such conditions may include but are not limited to temporary
street and alley extensions, temporary cul-de-sacs, and off-site utility
extensions.
   (E)   Application procedure and requirements.
      (1)   Pre-application conference.  Before preparing the sketch plat, the
applicant is strongly encouraged to schedule an appointment and meet with the
Community Development Director to discuss the procedures for approval of the
plat and the requirements as to general layout of streets and or reservations
of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar
matters, as well as the availability of existing services.
      (2)   General application requirements.  Prior to platting of the land,
the property owner shall file an application for approval of a sketch plat with
the Commission. The application and sketch plat shall meet the following
minimum requirements:
         (a)   The application shall include all contiguous holdings of the
property owner with an indication of the portion which is proposed to be
developed or offered, sold or leased, accompanied by an affidavit of ownership,
which includes an address and telephone number of an agent who shall be

title block clearly showing the proposed name of the subdivision or addition,
the name and address of the owner and the engineer or surveyor responsible for
the designer survey, the scale of the drawing, the date the drawing was
prepared, and the legal description of the track.
         (d)   The sketch plat shall clearly show the limits of the tract and
scale distances. True north shall be clearly indicated and shall be to the top
or left of the study.
         (e)   The sketch plat shall show the names of adjacent subdivisions or
additions or the name of record owners of adjoining parcels of unplatted land.
         (f)   The study shall contain the existing zoning on adjoining land,
the location, width, and names of all existing or platted streets or other
public ways within or adjacent to the tract, existing permanent buildings,
railroad rights-of-way, utility and drainage easements, and topography with
existing drainage channels or creeks, and other important features such as tree
groupings, vegetation, political subdivisions or corporate limits and school
district boundaries.
         (g)   The study shall show the layout, names and width of proposed
thoroughfares, collector streets, and intersections, and shall show a general
configuration of proposed streets and alleys.
         (h)   The study shall show a general arrangement of land uses,
including but not limited to park and school sites, municipal facilities,
private open space, floodplains and drainage ways, phasing plan, and proposed
nonresidential and residential uses and densities.
      (3)   Additional requirements prerequisite to preliminary plat approval. 
Except as permitted, prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat, the
applicant shall submit for approval a sketch plat, at a scale of one inch
equals 100 feet or larger, depicting all information required and the following
additional items:
         (a)   The layout, names, and width of proposed streets, alleys, and
easements.
         (b)   Layout, numbers, and approximate dimensions of proposed lots and
all building fines.
         (c)   The location of proposed screening wails and/or other forms of
screening shall be clearly indicated.
         (d)   Existing contours of the tract in intervals of two feet or less,
referred to sea level datum.
         (e)   Existing sewers, water mains, culverts, or other underground

and locations included.
         (f)   Proposed water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer pipe lines with
culverts, bridges, and other appurtenances or structures shown.
         (g)   Storm water retention or detention basins as required.
         (h)   Erosion mitigation of lots or roads next to creeks and drainage
ways.
         (i)   General tree survey information.
      (4)   Standards for approval.  No sketch plat shall be approved by the
Planning Commission for a plat which is intended for development unless it
conforms to the Comprehensive Plan and the development ordinances of the city.
      (5)   Approval procedure.  After review of the sketch plat, the report
and recommendations of the Community Development Director and the exhibits
submitted at a scheduled meeting, the Planning Commission shall approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the sketch plat. One copy of the proposed
sketch plat shall be returned to the owner with the date of approval or
disapproval and the reasons therefor accompanying the copy. If the Planning
Commission disapproves the proposed sketch plat, the applicant may execute an
appeal to the City Council in the manner proscribed in these regulations.
      (6)   Effect of approval.  Approval of the sketch plat in conformance to
these procedures by the Planning Commission constitutes authorization by the
city for the property owner to submit application for approval of a preliminary
plat subject to compliance with any conditions attached to approval of the
sketch plat. The approval of any study or plat other than a preliminary plat
does not certify the availability or capacity of infrastructure or that the
property is suitable for development. The determination of infrastructure needs
and capacity and the delineation of floodplain or other limitations on
development will be done only during the review and approval of either a
preliminary or final plat complete with required engineering plans and studies.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.043  PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the preliminary plat is to provide an interim
step in the procedure at which point the subdivider shall present drawings of
the detail features of the subdivision. It is at this point that the items
discussed at the sketch plat stage and as set down herein are prepared in a
form from which determinations can be made as to the technical workability of
the development proposal.
   (B)   After the Planning Commission has approved the sketch plat, the
subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the preliminary plat. After the
subdivider has prepared the preliminary plat, he or she may take either of the
following actions:
      (1)   He or she may present the preliminary plat and preliminary plat
checklist to the Planning Commission and obtain approval thereof before
proceeding with preparation of the improvement plans; or
      (2)   He or she may present the improvement plans and improvement plans
checklist to the Planning Commission at the time the preliminary plat and
preliminary plat checklist are presented.
   (C)   Whenever the subdivider presents to the Planning Commission a
preliminary plat and preliminary plat checklist, without improvement plans, the
Planning Commission may conditionally approve the preliminary plat, subject to
Planning Commission approval of the improvement plans within six months
following the preliminary plat conditional approval.
   (D)   After review of the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall,
within 60 days of its submission, approve, conditionally approve or reject the

   (E)   Whenever the subdivider presents to the Planning Commission the
preliminary plat, preliminary plat checklist, improvement plans and improvement
plans checklist and the Planning Commission finds that the plat and improvement
plans meet all the requirements of these regulations, it shall approve the
preliminary plat and improvement plans by placing a certificate of approval
upon each copy of the plat and plans. Such certificate of approval shall bear
the signature of the Chairperson and Secretary of the Planning Commission and
shall provide that the approval given thereby does not constitute approval for
purposes of recording.
   (F)   Approval of the preliminary plat shall not in all cases entitle the
subdivider to approval of the final plat. Upon preliminary approval, if any
conditions arise which would cause the preliminary plat to become
unsatisfactory due to health, safety or welfare of the community, the Planning
Commission shall recommend that the final plat be rejected.
   (G)   Application procedure and requirements.  On forms approved by the

additions. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the preliminary
plat. One copy of the proposed preliminary plat shall be returned to the owner
with the date of approval, conditional approval or disapproval and the reasons
therefor accompanying the plat if the Planning Commission disapproves the
proposed preliminary plat, the applicant may execute an appeal in the manner
prescribed in these regulations.
      (6)   Effect of approval.  Approval of a preliminary plat by the Planning
Commission constitutes authorization for the City Engineer to release
construction plans subject to his or her final approval and for the City
Engineer to authorize for the property owner to commence grading of the site
and construction of such public improvements as are required by the Planning
Commission. Approval of a preliminary plat also authorizes the property owner,
upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval, to submit for
approval an application for final plat approval. Upon release of the
construction plans, the City Engineer may, upon request of the applicant, issue
a certificate indicating the construction plans have been released and
construction of the improvement is thereafter authorized. Additional
certificates may be issued by the City Engineer authorizing the construction of
private utilities on a phased schedule. The certificate shall read as follows:
“The preliminary plat for (insert name of the subdivision or addition) as
approved by the City of Durant Planning Commission on (insert date of approval)
is authorized for use with engineering plans for the construction of public
improvements as approved by the City Engineer. A final plat shall be approved
by the Planning Commission upon the completion of all public improvements or
the provision of a subdivision improvement agreement under the terms of the
Subdivision Ordinance and submission of a final plat in compliance with Section
3.6 of the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Durant.
Zoning regulations that affect exterior appearance of a single-family house or
the landscaping of a single-family lot and that are adopted after approval of a
preliminary plat for a single-family residential development, shall not apply
for a period of two years from the latter of the date of plat approval or the
date of the acceptance of public improvements related to the plat."
      (7)   Lapse of preliminary plat approval.  The approval of a preliminary
plat shall be effective for a period of two years from the date that the
preliminary plat is approved by the Planning Commission or the City Council, at
the end of which time the applicant must have submitted and received approval
for a final plat. If a final plat is not submitted and approved within two
years, or an extension is not granted in accordance with these regulations, the
preliminary plat approval shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be
required to submit a sketch plat for review subject to the then existing zoning
restrictions and subdivision regulations.
   (H)   Construction plan procedure and requirements.
      (1)   General application requirement. Construction plans shall be
prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer or architect
registered in the State of Oklahoma as required by state law governing such
professions. Plans submitted for review by the city shall be dated and bear the
responsible engineer’s or architect's name, serial number and the designation
of "engineer," "professional engineer," or "P.E." or "architect" and an
appropriate stamp or statement near the engineer's or architect's
identification, stating that the documents are for preliminary review and are
not intended for construction. Final plans acceptable to the city shall bear
the seal and signature of the engineer or architect and the date signed on all
sheets of the plans. Public works construction in streets, alleys or easements
which will be maintained by the city shall be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the State of Oklahoma.
      (2)   Construction plan review procedure. Copies of the construction
plans, and the required number of copies of the plat shall be submitted to the
City Engineer for final approval. The plans shall contain all necessary
information for construction of the project, including screening wails and
other special features. All materials specified shall conform to the design
standards of the city. Each sheet of the plans shall contain a title block
including space for the notation of revisions. This space is to be completed
with each revision to the plan sheet and shall clearly note the nature of the
revision and the date the revision was made. The City Engineer will release the
plans for construction, after approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning
Commission and payment of all inspection fees. Upon such release, each
contractor shall maintain one set of plans, stamped with city release, on the
project at all times during construction. This procedure shall also apply to
approval of a final plat, if a preliminary plat is omitted.
      (3)   Failure to commence construction.  If construction has not
commenced within one year after approval of the plans, resubmittal of plans may
be required by the City Engineer for meeting current standards and engineering
requirements. CONSTRUCTION shall mean installation of city maintained public
improvements.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.044  FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the final plat is to create a record document
which accurately describes the subdivided land, both as to accurate dimensions,
and as to legal provisions which are pertinent to the subdivision. Much of the
reason for this step is to make the transfer of the land more simple and
certain. Land sales by reference to a legally filed plat are generally less
complicated and more likely to provide the precise legal situation sought. The
certainty of such sales derives from the assurance of an accurate survey and
processes designed to assure the provision of facilities necessary to service
the land.
   (B)   At the time the final plat and final plat checklist are submitted to
the Community Development Department, the subdivider shall take one of the
following courses of action:
      (1)   If the subdivider elects to, deposit the surety bond as specified
in §
156.026, he or she shall submit plans for all improvements required under this
chapter, such plans to bear the approval of the Planning Commission. Upon
completion of a portion of the construction of the required improvements, the
Planning Commission may release a portion of the surety bond in the amount of
the costs of the constructed improvements, as estimated by the Planning
Commission, Secretary or municipal staff. Before any portion of the surety bond
may be released, the City Engineer, City Building Inspector or City Manager
shall approve the as-built plans and specifications for that portion of the
improvements for which the subdivider has requested release of the surety bond;
      (2)   If the subdivider elects to complete all improvements as specified
in the preliminary plat, he or she shall submit the as-built specifications and
as-built original tracings of all improvements. If the Secretary of the
Planning Commission finds that the as-built plan and specifications comply with
requirements, and that the actual construction is as shown in the plans and
specifications, he or she shall endorse his or her approval thereon.
   (C)   All actions of the Planning Commission, whether approving final plats
for all or part of an area shown in a preliminary plat shall, in so far as the
plat involves dedications to the public, constitute only an authorization for
the subdivider to submit the plat to the City Council to which the dedications
are proposed. Such Planning Commission actions shall not constitute an
acceptance of dedication or a commitment to accept dedication.
   (D)   Applicability.  A final plat shall be required for subdivisions of
property and the recording of single lots in accordance with these regulations.
   (E)   Application procedure and requirements.  A final plat for minor
subdivisions may be approved by the Community Development Director. A final
plat for a major subdivision shall require approval by the Planning Commission.
Final plats shall comply to the preliminary plat where applicable. The
application shall be accompanied by the following:
      (1)   Four mylar and four paper copies of the proposed final plat bearing
all information specified in these regulations and the following:
         (a)   The final plat shall be clearly and legibly prepared by a

34 inches and shall be drawn to the scale of one inch equals 100 feet, unless
the Community Development Director authorizes a different scale in writing.
         (b)   Notice statement.  "Notice: Selling a portion of this addition
by metes and bounds is a violation of city ordinance and state law and is

that may be reserved by covenant in the deeds for the common use for the common
use of the property owners in the subdivisions, with the purpose indicated
thereon.
         (h)   The exact layout including:
            1.   Street and alley fines, including their names, bearings,
angles of intersection and widths (including widths along the line of any
intersecting street):
            2.   The length of all arcs, radii, internal angles, points of
curvature, length, and bearings of the tangents.
            3.   All easements for rights-of-way provided for public services
or utilities and any limitations of the easements.
            4.   All lot numbers and lines with accurate dimensions in feet and

         (l)   In case the subdivision is traversed by water course, channel,
stream, or creek, the prior or present location of such water course, channel,
stream, or creek shall be shown on the plat and the boundary of the regulatory
flood and the ten-year flood. It will be assumed that there is no significant
difference between the two and the regulatory flood will be used, unless the
owner shows the ten-year flood on the map.
         (m)   North point, scale, and date.
         (n)   Legal description according to the real estate records
maintained by the County Clerk's office and area calculations.

plat approval as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   As-built construction plans, where applicable.
      (5)   Covenants and deed restrictions, if any.
      (6)   Accurate legal description.
      (7)   Certification by a registered public surveyor to the effect that

easements and other matters of record affecting the property being platted.
      (8)   The County Clerk's office and applicable state statutes may require
additional information to be submitted or included on the final plat.
   (F)   Standards for approval.  No final plat shall be approved by the
Community Development Director, the Planning Commission or the City Council
unless the following standards have been met:
      (1)   The plat substantially conforms to the preliminary plat.
      (2)   Required public improvements have been constructed and are ready to
be accepted, and/or an improvement agreement has been accepted by the city
providing for the subsequent completion of improvements.
      (3)   The plat conforms to applicable zoning and other regulations.
      (4)   Provision has been made for adequate public facilities under the
terms of this chapter.
      (5)   The plat meets all other requirements of this chapter.
   (G)   Approval procedure.  After review of the final plat, the Community
Development Director shall place the final plat for consideration on the agenda
of a public meeting of the Planning Commission. Minor plats may be approved by
the Community Development Director or referred to the Planning Commission in
accordance with these regulations. In the event of disapproval, reasons for
disapproval shall be stated. One copy of the final subdivision plat shall be
returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval or
disapproval noted on the final plat, and, if the final plat is disapproved, the
reasons for disapproval accompanying the final plat.
   (H)   Appeals.  If the Planning Commission disapproves the final plat, the
applicant may appeal to the City Council in the manner prescribed in these
regulations.
   (I)   Certificate of compliance.  Upon final approval of a final plat
required by these regulations, the Planning Commission shall issue to the
person applying for approval a certificate stating that the final plat has been
approved by the Planning Commission and/or the City Council. For purposes of
this section, final approval shall not occur until all conditions of approval
have been met.
   (J)   Signing and recording of final plat.
      (1)   When an improvement agreement and security are required, the
Chairman of the Planning Commission, or the Mayor, if approval has been granted
by the City Council, and the Community Development Director or City Engineer
shall endorse approval on the final plat after the agreement and security have
been approved by the Planning Commission, and all the conditions pertaining to
the final plat have been satisfied.
      (2)   When installation of public improvements is required prior to
recordation of the final plat, the Chairman of the Planning Commission or the
Mayor, if the plat has been approved by the City Council, and Community
Development Director or City Engineer shall endorse approval on the final plat
after all conditions of approval have been satisfied and all public
improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be written evidence that the
required public improvements have been installed in a manner satisfactory to
the city as shown by a certificate signed by the City Engineer stating that the
necessary dedication of public lands and installation of public improvements
has been accomplished.
      (3)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file the final
plat with the County Clerk. Simultaneously with the filing of the final plat,
the applicant shall record such other agreements of dedication and legal
documents as shall be required to be recorded by the City Attorney. The final
plat, bearing all required signatures, shall be recorded after final approval
and within ten working days of its receipt. One copy of the recorded final plat
shall be returned to the city prior to the issuance of any building permits.
   (K)   Effect of approval.  Approval of a final plat shall certify compliance
with the regulations of the city pertaining to the subdivision of land. An
approved and signed final plat may be filed with the county as a record of the
subdivision of land and may be used to reference lots and interests in property
thereon defined for the purpose of conveyance and development as allowed by
these regulations.
   (L)   Lapse of final plat approval.  The approval of a final plat shall be
effective for a period of six months from the date that the final plat is
approved by the Planning Commission or the City Council, at the end of which
time the applicant must have met the requirements for recording of the final
plat with the County Clerk. If the applicant has not met the requirements for
recording of the final plat with the County Clerk within six months, or an
extension is not granted in accordance with these regulations, the final plat
approval shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be required to submit
a new plat for review subject to the then existing zoning restrictions and
subdivision regulations. No certificate of occupancy or change of occupancy
permit will be allowed for the property until the applicant has met the
requirements for filing of the final plat with the County Clerk.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.045  CONVEYANCE PLATS.
   (A)   Purpose.  A conveyance plat may be used solely for the purpose of
subdividing land and the recording of same, or recording a single existing lot
or parcel created by other means. A conveyance plat may be used to convey the
property or interests therein; however, a conveyance plat does not constitute
approval for development of the property and is not intended for immediate
development. A conveyance plat is an interim step in the subdivision and
development of land.
   (B)   Applicability.  Conveyance plats may be used in lieu of a final plat
to record the subdivision of property in the following instances:
      (1)   To record the remainder of a tract larger than five acres created
by the final platting of a portion of the property provided that the remainder
is not intended for immediate development.
      (2)   To record the subdivision of property into parcels five acres or
smaller in size that are not intended for immediate development, and where all
public improvements exist prior to approval and minimum frontage requirements
are met. All public rights-of-way must be dedicated and all abutting streets
and utilities must be installed and accepted by the city. Installation of on-
site improvements may be delayed if development of other tracts is not
affected.
   (C)   Application procedure and requirements.
      (1)   Application requirements.  The property owner shall submit an
application, together with other supporting documents and fees, to the
Community Development Director by an official submittal date. A conveyance plat
and associated documents shall include all information required for a final
plat and the additional information listed below:
         (a)   Construction plans shall not be required except where street,
utility and drainage improvements are proposed by the owner. Construction
plans, easements, and dedications as appropriate shall be submitted concurrent
with the conveyance plat or any subsequent replat. The construction plans, if
any, shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer
registered in the State of Oklahoma and shall bear his or her seal on each
sheet.
         (b)   All conveyance plats must be titled "Conveyance Plat" and carry
the following wording:
"A conveyance plat is a record of property approved by the city for the purpose
of sale or conveyance in its entirety or interests thereon defined. No building
permit shall be issued nor permanent public utility service provided until a
final plat is approved, filed of record and public improvements accepted in
accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations of the City of
Durant. Selling a portion of this property by metes and bounds, except as shown
on an approved, filed and accepted conveyance plat, final plat or replat is a
violation of the city Ordinance and State Law."
      (2)   Standard for approval.
         (a)   Access.  All tracts, parcels, lots or sites created by a
conveyance plat shall have frontage and access to an existing or proposed
public street defined in the city's Comprehensive Plan or an existing standard
street meeting city construction standards and accessing the existing city
street system.
         (b)   Reservation of rights-of-way. Conveyance plats must provide for
the reservation of future rights-of-way of planned roadways. Right-of-way
reservation acknowledges the future obligation to dedicate right-of-way for
public thoroughfares and streets specified in the city's Comprehensive Plan or
approved land study. Reservation of right-of-way does not grant any right or
interest in the property to the city or other entity. The final alignment may
be adjusted upon final platting in order to meet engineering design standards.
         (c)   Dedication of rights-of-way. Dedication of right-of-way shall be
required where a conveyance plat is used to record the remainder of a tract
created by the final platting of a portion of the property. The required right-
of-way dedication shall be limited to that which is necessary to provide access
to the property proposed for final plat approval and to complete turn lanes,
intersections and transitions in road pavement width resulting from development
of the property proposed for final plat approval.
      (3)   Approval procedure.  A conveyance plat meeting all requirements of
the city may be placed on the consent agenda of the Planning Commission.
Conveyance plats shall be approved provided they comply with all appropriate
ordinances and the Comprehensive Plan. The Planning Commission must approve,
conditionally approve or deny a conveyance plat no later than 30 days from the
date of application. If denied, the Planning Commission shall provide a written
explanation of the reason for denial. If the Planning Commission fails to
approve or deny the application within 30 days of the official submission date,
the conveyance plat shall be deemed approved. A conveyance plat qualifying as a
minor plat shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Community Development
Director in accordance with these regulations.
      (4)   Signing and filing.
         (a)   After the approval of the conveyance plat by the Planning
Commission, and the correction of the conveyance plat as required by the
Planning Commission, the property owner may file the conveyance plat with the
county. The owner shall file the conveyance plat within six months from the
date of approval. Any conveyance plat which has not been filed with the county
within six months of the date of approval shall be void. Prior to filing with
the county, the property owner may withdraw and void a conveyance plat. Any
conveyance plat withdrawn and/or voided must be resubmitted under current
regulations and procedures and reapproved by the Planning Commission and filed
with the county. Prior to filing, the Chairman of the Planning Commission or
the Community Development Director shall endorse approval of the conveyance
plat. One copy of the recorded final plat shall be returned to the city within
ten days of filing.
         (b)   No final plat processed and approved in association with a
conveyance plat shall be filed without the concurrent filing of the associated
approved conveyance plat.
      (5)   Effect.
         (a)   Conveyance plat approval and acceptance by the city does not
relieve the owner from obligations, including fees, required by other sections
of this or other ordinances of the city pertaining to the improvement of the
property or extension of services as required to make the property suitable for
development.
         (b)   Neither reservation nor dedication of right-of-way shall relieve
the property owner from obligations for street construction or assessments
associated with public street improvement programs. Easements for access,
utilities and drainage may be recorded on conveyance plats.
         (c)   Final platting requirements.
            1.   No building permits shall be issued nor permanent utility
service provided for land which has only received approval as a conveyance
plat. Notwithstanding the above, the Community Development Director may
authorize temporary building permits, temporary occupancy permits, and
temporary utility service.
            2.   A conveyance plat may be superseded by a preliminary plat or
final plat in total or in part through compliance with the procedures and
requirements of this chapter.
         (d)   Agricultural use.  The use of a conveyance plat shall not
prohibit the use of the subdivided land for agricultural uses as permitted in
the zoning regulations of the city.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.046  DEVELOPMENT PLAT.
   (A)   This section applies to the platting and development of any single
parcel greater than five acres or the subdivision and development of any
property into parts, each part being greater than five acres. The term
DEVELOPMENT means the new construction or the enlargement of any exterior
dimension of any building, structure, or improvement. The term IMPROVEMENT
shall include the construction of a utility, road, parking, or drainage system.
The term shall also apply to the grading of land or clearance of trees, except
as may be permitted for valid agricultural use of the property.
   (B)   A development plat must be prepared by a registered professional land
surveyor as a boundary survey showing:
      (1)   Each existing or proposed building, structure or improvement or
proposed modification of the external configuration of the building, structure
or improvement;
      (2)   Each easement and right-of-way within or abutting the boundary of
the surveyed property; and
      (3)   The dimensions of each street, sidewalk, alley, square, park, or
other part of property intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of
purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the street, sidewalk,
alley, square, park, or other part; and
      (4)   Any additional information as required by this chapter to apply for
the approval of a plat.
   (C)   The requirements and standards for design, reservation, construction,
completion, maintenance, cost participation and escrow for public improvements
applying to the approval of a plat shall also apply to a development plat.
   (D)   Development plats shall be processed under the same procedures and are
subject to the same fees as apply to a plat. The procedures for a minor
subdivision may be used when applicable.
   (E)   A development plat shall be approved if it conforms to the following
standards:
      (1)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances of the city concerning its
current and future streets, sidewalks, alleys, parks, playgrounds, and public
utility facilities; and
      (2)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances for the extension of the
city or the extension, improvement, or widening of its roads, streets, and
public highways within the municipality.
   (F)   New development may not begin on the property until the development
plat is filed with and approved by the city. Approved development plats and
other agreements of dedication and legal documents as required shall be
recorded with the County Clerk by the applicant.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.047  LOT-SPLITS.
   (A)   Application.  Whenever any lot-split is proposed to be made, the owner
or his or her agent shall submit to the Community Development Director an
application for review and approval which shall consist of:
      (1)   An application form as prescribed by the Community Development
Director.
      (2)   Four copies of each certified survey prepared by a land surveyor
registered in the State of Oklahoma, showing the dimensioned location of
structures and easements thereon, together with the precise nature, location
and dimensions of both of the following:
         (a)   The proposed new lot; and
         (b)   The remaining portion of the original lot after the split.
      (3)   The Community Development Director may require additional plat
information regarding adjacent property, in order to ensure that future access
needs can be met.
   (B)   Review and action by Community Development Director.  Lot split
requests shall be administered by the Community Development Director or his or
her official designee. The Community Development Director shall not approve a
lot-split if:
      (1)   A new public street or alley is needed; or
      (2)   All easement requirements have not been satisfied; or
      (3)   Substandard or unusable lots according to the subdivision,
building, and zoning regulations would be created; or
      (4)   The lot-split will create lots violating the "spirit" of the size
of lots in the same and surrounding subdivisions; or
      (5)   The lot has previously been split in accordance with these
regulations (requires a minor subdivision).
   (C)   Recording of lot-split.  The lot-split approval certificate and the
survey plats for both new lots created shall be recorded with the County Clerk
by the applicant within seven days of approval by the Review Committee. One of
the four copies shall be returned to the Community Development Department
within seven days of its recording with the County Clerk.
   (D)   Appeal.  In the event of denial by the Community Development Director,
the application for a lot-split may be submitted to the Planning Commission,
for a fee as set by the City Council by motion or resolution, as a regular
agenda item for their review, modification, approval or denial. In the event of
denial by the Planning Commission, the application for a lot-split may be
submitted to the City Council, for a fee, as a regular agenda item for their
review, modification, approval or denial.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
§ 156.048  REPLATTING OF LAND.
   (A)   Replat required.  Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a
property owner who proposes to replat any portion of an already approved final
plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for
the replat under the same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for
the platting of land by these regulations. The Community Development Director
may waive or modify requirements for a sketch plat under circumstances where
the previously approved sketch plat is sufficient to achieve the purposes set
forth in these regulations.
   (B)   Replatting without vacating preceding plat. A replat of a final plat
or portion of a final plat may be recorded and is controlling over the
preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat:
      (1)   Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being
replatted;
      (2)   Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter at which parties
in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard, by the Planning
Commission: and
      (3)   Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions
previously incorporated in the final plat.
   (C)   Additional requirements for certain replays.
      (1)   A notice of the public hearing shall be published in an official
paper or a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior
to the date of the public hearing. Notice shall be mailed to all owners of
property located within 300 feet of the subject property as provided by a
certified abstractor's list at the applicant's cost at least 20 days prior to
the hearing;
      (2)   If the proposed replat requires a variance, and the owners of 20%
or more of the area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under
division (B) file with the Planning Commission a written protest of the
replatting before or at the hearing, approval of the replat will require the
affirmative vote of four of the Planning Commission members. In computing
percentages of ownership, each lot is considered equal to all other lots
regardless of size or number of owners, and the owners of each lot are entitled
to cast only one vote per lot. The area of streets and alleys shall be included
in computing the percentage of land area.
      (3)   Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original lot
boundaries.
(Ord. 1573, passed 11-13-07)
DESIGN STANDARDS; NEIGHBORHOOD FEATURES
§ 156.060  COMMUNITY GENERAL.
   (A)   The quality of the design of the community, both in the urban area and
on the fringes of the urban development, is dependent on the quality of design
of the individual subdivisions in the area. Good community design can be
accomplished by following a few principles. These better approaches to the
layout of new areas. The violation of some of the basic rules concerning design
of streets, ditches and other features can lead to such unpleasant situations
as: streets that deteriorate and are expensive to maintain, street
intersections that are dangerous, drainage ditches that clog up and cause
flooding, building lots that are difficult or expensive to construct upon or
difficulties with erosion during the time of development and even throughout
the life of the homes.
   (B)   The figures which follow show some of the better ways of creating a
subdivision. The use of good design and holding to these methods of development
can provide for the least expense in the building of a subdivision. This is
especially true considering the costs that come to the purchasers of property
that has been improperly developed and the fact that there is no cheaper time
to solve development problems than before houses are built and lots are sold.
   (C)   Figure 1 shows some of the patterns of streets and lots that might be
possible in the development of areas in large, rural estates type lots. In the
shaded area is shown an all too frequent approach to the creating of lots in
rural settings. There are a number of problems from the arrangement of lots in
a road frontage strip as in the shaded area, such as:
      (1)   Long narrow parcels which are of reduced usefulness to the buyer;
      (2)   Increased numbers of driveways intersecting the section line road
(this is a major problem to the county as it tries to keep ditches and culverts
clean and working);
      (3)   The narrower lots result in closer spacing of houses with less
privacy and greater possibility of failure in the operation of individual sewer
systems; and
      (4)   (a)   The frontage of each house upon a section line road means
greater exposure to the dust, traffic, litter and drainage problems which occur
along the major roads (also there is a loss of privacy and the danger that the
road may have to be widened at some time in the future taking part of the front
lawn).
         (b)   On the other hand, some of the other styles of lot arrangements
shown can provide lots of much more usable shape, more privacy, safer traffic,
more workable utility layout, better spacing of buildings and the like.
   (D)   The majority of land developed in the manner shown in Figure 1 is
expected to be in the jurisdiction of the regional planning commission outside
the incorporated area of the city.
   (E)   These are not all of the possibilities for laying out a large lot
development. In fact, a development usually turns out better if it is worked
out to fit the shape of the particular piece of land considering the streams,
hills and the like. However, from this figure it can be seen that almost any
other arrangement is better than a strip of long, narrow lots along the
frontage of a major road.

Notes:      1.   Property dimensions in many cases are shown as less the right-
of-way dimension. This reflects the improvement of the street or road and
dedication of it to the public.
      2.   Covenants should provide for access to lots to be only from side
roads.

Notes:      1.   Minor streets should be designed to provide access in a manner
to discourage use by through traffic.
      2.   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from
minor streets to major streets.
      3.   Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided only
on minor streets.
      4.   Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways.
      5.   The urban area shall be designed as a group of integrated
residential neighborhoods with appropriate industrial, commercial and public
facilities.
      6.   Lots, blocks and street systems should be designed for the most
advantageous use of topography and natural physical features.

§ 156.061  STREETS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to all of the elements of the general plan and shall be designed
in accordance with the following provisions:
   (A)   Major streets shall be planned to conform with the major streets shown
in the comprehensive plan;
   (B)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Planning Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage
with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear
property line, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation from
traffic;
   (C)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way of
limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. The
following sketch illustrates both suitable and unsuitable ways of laying out
developments bordering major right-of-way.

   (D)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is placed in the city under conditions approved by
the Planning Commission and acceptable to the subdivider;
   (E)   Where the plat to be submitted includes the only part of the tract
owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a
proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion may be required by
the Planning Commission;
   (F)   Where a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical location
and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility easements; and
   (G)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
STREET JOGS LESS THAN 125 FEET SHALL BE AVOIDED

Residential streets     60 feet
 
   (I)   The paved width of all streets shall be adequate to serve the existing
and future estimated traffic load for the facility. Lane width for all streets
shall be as follows:
      (1)   All major streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not less
than 11 feet or more than 12 feet in width, and lanes for parallel parking or

      (2)   All minor streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not less
than 9 feet or more than 12 feet in width and lanes for parallel parking of not
less than 8 feet in width. Streets should be developed in accordance with the
general standards given in the code of the city.
   (J)   (1)   A cul-de-sac should not exceed 500 feet in length, measured from
the entrance to the center of the turnaround unless a dedicated secondary
emergency sealed-surface accessible ingress and egress is provided to the
primary roadway to a point within 500 feet of the center of the turnaround
radius. The ingress and egress shall be, at a minimum, in the form of a 20-
foot wide dedicated public easement that is graded, compacted, sealed-surface,
and otherwise constructed to the city’s specifications.
      (2)   If the cul-de-sac is longer than 150 feet then a turnaround radius
of not less than 65 feet at the property line and 50 feet at the curb line
shall be provided. If there is provided in the center of the turnaround an
unpaved island, it shall be improved with landscaping that will not interfere
with sight distance. The unpaved island shall have  a radius of not less than 6
feet and the radius from the curb line of the island to the turnaround outside
curb shall be 30 feet with the easement extending an additional 15 feet beyond

   (K)    Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, provided that the Planning Commission finds
it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the street
easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
platted within the tract being subdivided;
   (L)   The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in
the subdividing of adjacent properties. The Planning Commission may require the
dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the development of adjoining
properties;
   (M)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission;
   (O)   Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by arterial traffic
will be discouraged;

25 feet at the curb line or its equivalent;
      (3)   Street intersections involving major thoroughfares shall have a
minimum street corner radius of 30 feet at the curb line or its equivalent;
      (4)   In order to provide for traffic safety, there shall be platted on
each corner of each intersection of two streets a sight triangle which shall be
described as a triangle having 25-foot sides on each of the street rights-of-
way or a radius of 25 feet. The plat or the covenants of the addition shall
clearly prohibit any construction or planting of landscaping materials that
reach greater than 2 feet in height in this right-of-way.

definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street
loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses
proposed;
   (B)   Alleys serving commercial and industrial areas shall be not less than
30 feet in width;
   (C)   Alleys are not required for residential areas, but when provided shall
be not less than 20 feet in width;
   (D)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment should be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement;

   (A)   Where alleys are not provided, easements not less than ten feet wide
shall be provided along each rear lot line. A five-foot easement along side lot
lines of individual plots may be required where necessary for use by public and
private utilities. The Planning Commission may require air rights and easements
of greater width for the extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other
utilities where it is deemed necessary.
   (B)   When a subdivision is adjacent to unplatted land, the easements for
public and private utilities shall be:
      (1)   Provided as 20 feet wide on the land being subdivided; or
      (2)   Provided as ten feet wide on the land being subdivided with an
easement ten feet wide being presented adjacent and simultaneous to the
presentation of the final plat.

(`93 Code, § 12-446)  (Ord. 1041, passed 4-12-83)
§ 156.067  DRAINAGE.
   (A)   These regulations and standards are designed, intended and should be
administered in a manner to protect the various drainage areas in the city from
flooding; to provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff; to prevent
pollution of watersheds, streams and natural drainage channels; to prevent the
encroachment of buildings and improvements on natural drainage channels; to
equitably apportion the cost of improvements; to protect natural scenic areas;
and to provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the area and to
fulfill the requirements of the flood insurance administration. The regulations
and standards herein contained shall apply to the incorporated area of the
city. All subdivisions of land and all improvements of any character which
affect drainage in any portion of the city shall be subject to the provisions
of these regulations and be subject to approval by the City Public Works
Director or his or her designee. Development within the limits of the 100-year
flood shall be designed in such a manner that all finished floor elevations
shall be at least one foot above the 100-year floor level; provided, however,
that all earth fills within the 100-year flood level shall be approved by the
City Engineer; and provided, further, that development within the 100-year
flood shall not in any case plan for structures in the floodway as shown on the
official flood maps.
   (B)   (1)   The two classes of drainage channels shall be:
         (a)   Primary drainage channels; and
         (b)   Secondary drainage channels.
      (2)   In general, it is intended that channels which are designated as
primary channels serve a drainage area of 1,000 acres or more. It is intended
by these regulations that the improvement of primary drainage channels shall be
primarily the responsibility of the community as a whole, since the whole
community is materially benefitted. However, the developer of the land
containing a primary channel is expected to layout, design and otherwise plan
and carry out his or her improvements in a manner that will not interfere with
or restrict the natural flow of water or materially change the condition of
runoff. Increased runoff and changes in primary channels which are created by
improvements of an individual subdivision shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the subdivision and shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of these regulations. It is intended by these regulations that the
improvement of a secondary channel shall be the responsibility of the developer
of the area served by the channel, since the primary benefit is to the area
served by the secondary channel and not to the community as a whole.
   (C)   The maximum condition of rainfall for a 100-year interval plus one-
foot of freeboard shall be used for the purposes of determining all runoff for
the sizing of drainage channels and structures for the city, unless otherwise
specified herein. Values used in formulas for runoff and size of drainage
structures shall reflect the degree of urbanization set forth in the projected
land use pattern contained in the comprehensive plan for the city. The
following formulas and values shall be used for calculating all stream flow and
runoff for the policies and regulations established herein:
      (1)   Runoff from all drainage areas shall be determined by Rational
Formula:
      Q   =   AIR, in which
      Q   =   Cubic feet per second
      A   =   Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for
areas less than 1,000 acres and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger
areas
      I   =   Percent of imperviousness of the area may vary between 40% and
95%
      R   =   Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour,
based on time of concentration and latest government records for area (using
100-year storm plus one foot for primary and secondary channels).
      (2)   The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts and
bridges shall be determined using the Manning Formula:
      Q   =   1,486A r 2/3 s 1/2
                n
      Q   =   Discharge in cubic feet per
            second
      A   =   Cross-sectional area of water in conduit in square feet
      r   =   Hydraulic radius of water in conduit
      s   =   Mean slope of hydraulic gradient, in feet of vertical rise per
foot of horizontal distance
      n   =   Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of
conduit lining, but not less than 0.013.
   (D)   All primary drainage channels which are located within, or immediately
adjacent to an improvement or a subdivision shall be protected and improved by
the developer as follows:
      (1)   All land having an elevation below the 50-year maximum flood
elevation and not protected by levies or dikes shall be dedicated to the city
for the purpose of providing drainage and for public park and utility easement
use. The developer may retain unto himself or herself an easement for
landscaping, for installation and maintenance of ornamental elements and for
fencing. Access for proper maintenance to the area of the 100-year flood shall
not be obstructed;
      (2)   The existing channel laying within or immediately adjacent to the
subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the
channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to the extent required to
prevent overflow beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage area;
      (3)   Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building
sites and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas and streets
will not be subject to overflow and in a manner that will provide for the rapid
runoff of all rainfall;
      (4)   Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, back-sloping,
cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control
erosion for all the anticipated conditions of flow for the segment of channel
involved. Planting of appropriate species for landscape beauty is encouraged;
      (5)   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless
it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer; and
      (6)   Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be
constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations
where drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys.
   (E)   Surface drainage and all secondary channels within or adjacent to the
addition shall meet the following conditions:
      (1)   When a subdivision is traversed by a secondary drainage channel,
watercourse or stream which drains 160 acres or more of land, there shall be
provided a right-of-way for drainage and public parks and public utility
purposes adequate to contain all of the floodway of a 100-year maximum flood.
The right-of-way shall include all of the land within the subdivision that is
within the floodway as established by the official flood maps;
      (2)   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of
collecting surface water from adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting
side hill drainage shall be provided with an improved open channel;
      (3)   Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of
transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross channels
and which have a drainage area of less than 40 acres shall be improved with
closed storm sewers of an improved open channel when approved by the City
Engineer of the city. Where the secondary drainage channel has a drainage area
of greater than 40 acres, an improved open channel or closed storm sewer shall
be provided;
      (4)   A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless
it is placed in a closed storm sewer;
      (5)   Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface
water from each lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel or
paved street without crossing more than two adjacent lots;
      (6)   Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm
drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of six-inch high curbs
during a ten- year frequency rain for the area and grades involved.
However, the minimum finished grade at the building line shall be such that it
will not be affected by storms equivalent to a 100-year frequency plus one foot
of freeboard;
      (7)   Drainage area allowed for surface flow on streets at a point of
diversion shall not exceed 20 acres, regardless of flow;
      (8)   Drainage easements of satisfactory width to provide working room
for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers;
      (9)   Channel improvements shall be as follows:
         (a)   Open channels shall be improved by providing a paved section
that will carry the runoff from a rain of 5-year frequency and a sodded section
to carry the runoff from a rain of 10-year frequency. However, the minimum
finished grade at the building line shall be such that it will not be affected
by storms equivalent to a 100-year frequency plus one foot of freeboard. The
design of the channel improvements shall be in accordance with the standards
set forth on the three following figures. Where turbulence is sufficiently
limited, where natural beauty is thereby preserved and where erosion will not
result, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve omitting the paved
section; and
         (b)   Whenever an open improved channel is required or authorized for
a secondary drainage channel under the provisions of these regulations and the
channel crosses large residential lots (area of not less than 10,000 square
feet) and the channel improvement is to be designed as an integral part of the
landscaping of the area that will be maintained by the property owners of the
area, then the Planning Commission may modify the requirements of the first
part of this provision to permit a channel improvement design in accordance
with the third of the design alternatives shown.
   (F)   Requirements relating to improvements:
      (1)   Easements.  All storm drainage features shall be placed in proper
easements as set out in these regulations;
      (2)   Bridges and culverts.  Bridges and culverts shall be as follows:
         (a)   All flow of water across continuous streets or alleys shall be
through culverts or bridges;
         (b)   Bridges and culverts on primary drainage channels shall be sized
to accommodate a 100-year frequency rain, plus one foot of freeboard, based on
the drainage area involved;
         (c)   Bridges and culverts on secondary drainage channels which drain
160 acres or more of land shall be sized to accommodate a 100-year frequency
rain, plus one foot of freeboard, based on the drainage area involved. However,
a 50-year frequency may be used when overflow provisions are incorporated to
accommodate a 100-year frequency rain;
         (d)   Bridges and culverts on secondary drainage channels which drain
less than 160 acres of land shall be sized to accommodate a 10-year frequency
rain, based on the drainage area involved; provided, that all building
elevations shall have one foot of freeboard above overflows of the 100-year
storm;
         (e)   Design of bridges and culverts shall be submitted to and have
the approval of the City Engineer;
      (3)   Closed storm sewers.  Closed storm sewers shall be constructed of
pre-cast or pre-fabricated pipe or built in place of closed box design to serve
a ten-year frequency rain for the drainage area involved; and
      (4)   Open paved storm drainage.  Open paved storm drainage channels
shall be approved in accordance with specifications approved by the City
Engineer. Side slopes above the paved section shall be shaped and sodded on a
slope of four horizontal to one vertical or flatter. Fences capable of limiting
water flow or which would prevent proper maintenance and care of the drainage
facility shall not be erected below the shoulder of the sodded section.
Retaining walls or other decorative elements which do not prevent necessary
access for maintenance may be erected.
   (G)   The Planning Commission reserves the right to require improvements,
provisions of drainage easements and for provisions of agreements beyond the
boundaries of the addition to facilitate flow of water though the addition and
to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm sewer system.

(`93 Code, § 12-458)  (Ord. 1041, passed 4-12-83)
§ 156.088  RECOUPMENT COSTS.
   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to create a policy to assist
in determining procedure for the recovery or recoupment of costs expended for
public sewer, water, surface drainage or street construction (singularly or
combined hereafter referred to as development) by the owner of property or the
city where development has been placed on property of the owner or the city or
extended beyond the boundaries of the owner(s). Any such developmental
improvements will be voluntary and all costs will be paid by the owner, the
city, or both in any mutually agreed to percentages, so long as such
improvements are in accordance with the ordinances of the city. An agreement
will be signed by all parties making such improvements and the city delineating
the boundaries and scope of the project. Based upon the agreement or the
declaration by the city, a map and a list will be made a part of this
agreement, which will show all abutting properties subject to recoupment.
   (B)   Street construction and storm sewer: recoupment of costs for
additional construction.
      (1)   All eligible costs for additional improvements to streets shall be
recoverable by the owner, the city or both as appropriate. Eligible recoverable
development costs include the total improvement costs, including, but not
limited to, of all right-of-way costs (both temporary and permanent) and costs
for material, engineering, surveying, utility adjustments or relocation,
excavation, subgrade preparation, storm sewer installation or relocation
(including culverts and bridges), street pavement construction and turn lanes
(in accordance with the city development standards), signalization, curbs and
gutters, sidewalks, lighting, signage, other traffic control devices and other
amenities, as might be required, plus 2% of the total of all above costs as an
administrative fee to the city. Any of the above items paid for by general
obligation bonds, funds contributed by any private party or nongovernmental
entity or funds from any other governmental entity which are not subject to
repayment by the city shall be deducted in determining the total improvement
costs, except for right-of-way costs provided for in division (2) below.
      (2)   The city and/or the owner who funded the eligible recoverable
development costs shall be reimbursed for the total improvement costs of the
development by the abutting property owners who are responsible for development
construction. The original funding entity shall recoup the appropriate pro-rata
share for such construction. Additionally, the costs for all permanent right-
of-way acquisition shall be charged back specifically to that property
assignable to such costs, regardless of the source of funds used to acquire the
property.
      (3)   All properties physically contiguous to the right-of-way line of
the development construction occurring after the effective date of this section
shall be subject to the recoupment program charges. The only exceptions shall
be those properties which have previously constructed arterial streets adjacent
to such properties according to city requirements or those which have made
payments for deferred construction prior to the city entering into an agreement
or commencing design of a designated street. Those exceptions shall be exempt
from the obligations of this section and the corresponding pro-rata share shall
be the responsibility of the city.
      (4)   Each tract of property identified in division (3) above shall be
subject to the total improvement cost participation expense equal to such
tract's pro-rata share, any applicable permanent right-of-way costs and
inflation/deflation adjustment.
         (a)   Calculation of the costs of each individual tract shall be
determined as follows:
         Pro rata share = (a - b) x (c / d) x g, where:
            a   =   Total development costs
            b   =   Total right-of-way costs when the individual track is
exempt from paying the right-of-way costs (actual price paid for acquisition of
permanent right- of-way from subject tract)
            c   =   Front linear footage of subject tract
            d   =   Total development front linear footage
            g   =   Inflation/deflation adjustment from date of completion of
improvements to date of assessment of recoupment fee. Said adjustment shall be
based on changes in the consumer price index as reported by the United States
Department of Commerce.
         (b)   Other formulas may be used, with the approval of the City
Council, for determining the costs of each individual track.
   (C)   Water and sewer lines:  recoupment of costs for additional
construction.
      (1)   All eligible costs for oversize or extension of utility lines shall
be recoverable by the owner, the city, or both as appropriate. Eligible
recoverable utility line extension or oversize development costs include the
total improvement costs of the utility line, including all right-of-way/
easement costs (both temporary and permanent) and costs for engineering,
surveying, utility adjustments or relocation, excavation, backfill, subgrade
preparation, pavement repair, utility line construction and other amenities, as
might be required, plus 2% of the total of all above costs as an administrative
fee to the city. Any of the above items paid for by general obligation bonds or
funds from any other governmental entity which are not subject to repayment by
the city shall be deducted in determining the total improvement costs, except
for right-of-way costs provided for in division (b) below.
      (2)   The city and/or the owner(s) who funded the eligible recoverable
utility line oversize or extension costs shall be reimbursed for the total
improvement costs of the utility line by the abutting or serviced property
owners who are responsible for utility line construction. The original funding
entity(ies) shall recoup the appropriate pro-rata share for such construction.
Additionally, the costs for all right-of-way acquisition shall be charged back
specifically to that property assignable to such costs.
      (3)   All properties physically served by the improvement occurring after
the effective date of this section shall be subject to the recoupment program
charges. The only exceptions shall be those properties which have previously
constructed arterial streets adjacent to such properties according to city
requirements or those which have made payments for deferred construction prior
to the city entering into an agreement or commencing design of the
improvements. Those exceptions shall be exempt from the obligations of this
section and the corresponding pro-rata share shall be the responsibility of the
city.
      (4)   Each tract of property identified in division (3) above shall be
subject to the total water or sewer line oversize or extension cost
participation expense equal to such tract's pro-rata share, any applicable
right-of-way costs, and inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the
costs for each individual tract shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   Pro-rata share = (a - b) x (c / d) x g, where:
            a   =   Total improvement costs
            b   =   Right-of-way costs when the individual track is exempt from
paying the right-of-way costs
            c   =   Total square footage of liable property
            d   =   Total square footage of the project service area
            g   =   Inflation/deflation adjustment from date of completion of
improvements to date of assessment of recoupment fee. Said adjustment shall be
based on changes in the consumer price index as reported by the United States
Department of Commerce.
         (b)   Other formulas may be used, with the approval of the City
Council, for determining the costs of each individual track.
   (D)   Recoupment district administration.
      (1)   The total payments calculated above shall become a liability
against property subsequent to the contracting for the improvements. All such
obligations shall be paid in full before the filing of a plat, applying for a
building permit or making any improvements to the tract subject to this
section.
      (2)   Within 60 days following acceptance by the city of the completed
improvements of the subject development, the Community Development Director, or
his or her designee, shall prepare a tract map and list of the individually
affected tracts and the estimated pro-rata share attributable to each such
tract, hereinafter referred to as the map and list. The map and list will also
include all costs, if any, for right-of-way acquisition attributable to each
tract. The map and list shall be made available to the owners of all fee
interests in the affected properties. Notice of the map and list shall be filed
of record in the office of the City Clerk and the Bryan County Clerk. Upon
written request to the Community Development Department of the city, notice
shall be given within a reasonable time to the requesting party of the most
current estimate of the dollar value of the participation cost of any
identified tract of property. Except with reference to the filing of notice of
the map and list with the office of the City Clerk, nothing shall be deemed a
defect preventing the city from collecting the applicable recoupment cost under
this section.
      (3)   Any owner of a tract of property may, at any time after preparation
of the map and list, cause the tract's total obligation to be paid to the city.
Unless previously paid, the right-of-way cost and the pro-rata share
attributable to each tract, with appropriate Consumer Price Index adjustments,
is due prior to the filing of a final plat for any portion of the subject tract
making application for a building permit or causing any improvements to be made
to a tract subject to a recoupment fee assessment. If less than the total
subject tract is being final platted, the pro-rata share for that final plat
shall be the greater amount of either the percent of the total property final
platted or the percent of the property frontage included in the plat. No such
final plat shall be released for filing until the then due total costs are
actually paid.
      (4)   Each identified tract of property shall be subject to participation
in the recoupment program commencing with the date that the improvement
contract is approved by the city. As the total development cost cannot be
determined and notice of the assessment of same cannot be delivered until
completion of the improvement, the City Engineer and the Community Development
Director are authorized to develop procedures for the review and approval,
irrespective of the other provisions of this section, of platting procedures
after authorization of the improvement, but prior to the time that the
property's total share of the participation cost is determined and can be paid.
The procedures are directed to include, to the extent feasible, the assurance
to property owners and developers that plat approval may proceed so as not to
retard the progress of private development plans, while, at the same time, to
provide financial security to the city that the property's recoupment share
will be paid upon final ascertainment of the amount owed.
      (5)   Unless earlier paid, each defined tract's share of the
participation cost shall continue as an obligation of the property for its
determined share of the total improvement cost, plus the appropriate inflation/
deflation increase as outlined in this section, for and through a period of 20
years from the date of issuance of the map and list required in this section.
Beginning at year 21 and continuing through year 30, the pro-rata share shall
decrease at a rate of 10% of the pro-rata amount existing at the end of the
twentieth year until the pro-rata share obligation is reduced to $0.00 and thus
terminates at the end of the thirtieth year from the date of issuance of the
map and list.
   (E)   Developer harmless for impact of later development on subject
infrastructure.  A developer shall not be responsible for any later required
upgrades to infrastructure, when the upgrade requirement is caused by other
city approved development which accesses said infrastructure.
   (F)   Intensive use or development.  Due to the speculative nature of a
development, the designed capacity of the infrastructure installed may not be
adequate for a later use that is more intense than originally designed. When an
intense use or development is proposed that will exceed the designed capacity
of the infrastructure, as determined by the City Engineer, the new use
developer shall be responsible for any required upgrading cost.
   (G)   City Council approval required.  All recoupment districts and
agreements shall require the approval of the City Council. Approval or
disapproval by the City Council to enter into a recoupment agreement shall not
have any bearing on the developer's responsibility to install any and all
infrastructure required by any ordinance, regulation or policy of the city.
(Am. Ord. 1360, passed 2-12-02; Am. Ord. 1586, passed 1-8-08)
§ 156.089  MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   Developer harmless for impact of later development on subject
infrastructure.  A developer shall not be responsible for any later required
upgrades to infrastructure, when the upgrade requirement is caused by other
city approved development which accesses said infrastructure.
   (B)   Intensive use or development.  Due to the speculative nature of a
development, the designed capacity of the infrastructure installed may not be
adequate for a later use that is more intense than originally designed. When an
intense use or development is proposed that will exceed the designed capacity
of the infrastructure, as determined by the City Engineer, the new use
developer shall be responsible for any required upgrading cost.
   (C)   All public infrastructure to be dedicated to the city.  Unless
otherwise presented to the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council
all infrastructure, including streets, sidewalks, water mains and lines,
sanitary sewer mains and lines, and storm water drains shall be dedicated to
the city. Additionally, all infrastructure easements shall be dedicated to the
city.
   (D)   Undedicated infrastructure.  When a lack of evidence exists as to
whether the infrastructure in a development has been dedicated to the city and
such infrastructure is serving a public capacity, it shall be presumed that
such infrastructure belongs to the city.
(Ord. 1586, passed 1-8-08)
§ 156.999  PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in these regulations and lots of record established
prior to the effective date of this ordinance, no building permit shall be
Issued tor any now structure or change, improvement or alteration of any
existing structure on any tract of land which does not comply with all of the
provisions of this chapter.

corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter upon conviction
thereof shall be punished as provided in §
10.99.
   (D)   The city may issue citations to suspected violators of this chapter,
which citations shall state the violation that is alleged, the time of the
observation of the offense, any correction of the violation which is sought,
the time allowable for the accomplishment of the correction and the further
action which will be taken to seek remedy should correction not be
accomplished. The issuance of such citations does not preclude the filing of
charges in district court, nor shall the issuance of such citations be a
mandatory process precedent to the filing of charges in district court.

ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 157.020  A-1 GENERAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   The A-1, Agricultural District, is established for several purposes:
   (A)   To provide for the continued use of land for predominately
agricultural purposes;
   (B)   To preserve undeveloped areas until they can feasibly be developed at
urban standards and with adequate public safeguards of health, safety and the
like; and
   (C)   To restrict development in areas subject to severe flooding until such
time as it can be shown that these areas are no longer subject to flooding.
(`93 Code, § 12-207)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.021  R-1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   The R-1 Single-Family District is established as a district in which the use
of the land is for single-family dwellings, except as noted. It is the purpose
and intent of this district to promote the development of and the continued use
of the land for single-family dwellings and to prohibit commercial and
industrial use or any other use which would substantially interfere with the
development or continuation of single-family dwellings in this district. The
intent is to further discourage any use in this district which would generate
traffic or create congestion on neighborhood streets other than the normal
traffic which serves the residents in the area. This district further
encourages only those uses which because of character or size would not create
additional requirements and costs for public services which are in excess of
such requirements and costs if the district was not developed solely for
single-family dwellings.
(`93 Code, § 12-208)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.022  R-2 TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   This residential district is intended to provide for both low and moderate
population density. The density and yard space requirements are so arranged as
to provide general compatibility with the uses found in the R-1 Single-Family
District. Therefore, this classification may reasonably be placed in positions
which are adjacent to single-family areas or may be used as a transitional
zone. This district shall have the same restrictions concerning nonresidential
uses as apply in the R-1 Single-Family District.
(`93 Code, § 12-209)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.023  R-3 GENERAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   This residential district is intended to provide for a complete range of
density in population from low to fairly high. It is established as a district
in which the principal uses of the land are for multi-family dwellings and
similar higher density residential development. The intent is to encourage the
development and the continued use of land for multi-family dwellings and to
prohibit commercial and industrial uses or any other use which would
substantially interfere with the development or continuation of multi-family
dwellings in this district. It is further intended to discourage any use which
would generate traffic which serves the multi-family dwelling or similar
residential uses in this district and discourage any use which, because of its
characteristics or size, would create additional requirements and costs for
public services which are in excess of such requirements and costs if the
district were developed solely for multi-family or other similar residential
uses.
(`93 Code, § 12-210)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.023-A  R-4 MANUFACTURED HOUSING DISTRICT.
   This residential district is designated to provide for placement of factory-
built, single-family residential housing by right in either an approved land-
lease development or a platted subdivision.
(Ord. 1411, passed 9-8-03)
§ 157.023-B  FRONT YARD REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting
streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply
with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage.
   (B)   Where a building line has been established by plat approved by the
Planning Commission or, in the case of areas annexed into the city, approved by
a governmental agency having legal jurisdiction to approve such plats, and such
line requires a greater or lesser front yard setback than is prescribed by
these regulations for the district in which the building line is located, the
required front yard shall comply with the building line so established by such
plat.
   (C)   For existing through lots, a required front yard shall be provided on
both streets unless a building line for accessory buildings has been
established along one frontage on the plat or by ordinance, in which event only
an accessory building may be built on the line thus established. The main
building must observe the front yard requirements for both streets. In the case
of existing through lots which are bounded on three sides by streets, all yards
between the main building and a street shall be regulated as front yards unless
a front, side, and rear building line have been established by plat.
   (D)   If buildings along the frontage of any street between two intersecting
streets in any residential district have observed an average setback which is
greater or lesser in dimension than the minimum front yard or setback
established for the district in which the street frontage is located, and if no
front building line has been established by plat, then the average setback of
all buildings fronting upon such street between two intersecting streets shall
establish the minimum front yard requirement. All vacant lots shall be assumed
to have a minimum front yard specified for the district in computing the
average front yard. These provisions shall not be interpreted as requiring a
setback or front yard of more than ten feet greater than the front setback
observed by any building on a contiguous lot. The provisions shall be
superseded on any lot where a minimum building line has been established by
plat or ordinance and the front yard or setback provisions of such plat or
ordinance shall be observed. In all districts except CBD, the distance as
measured from the front lot line to the face of the building shall in no case
be less than 1/2 the height of the building.
   (E)   In residential districts, the minimum front yards specified in these
regulations may be reduced by a maximum of five feet when such yards front on
the bulb portion of a cul-de-sac. In no case shall the required front yard be
reduced to less than 20 feet under this provision.
   (F)   Except where staggered setbacks are permitted and used, residential
building lines shall be uniform for all contiguous lots along a block face.
Uniform residential building lines may be altered on a block face where there
is a separation of 15 feet or more between residential lots created by
intersecting alleys, creeks, and public or private open space.
   (G)   Attached front accessory buildings, including garages and carports,
shall have a front setback from the street or access way not less than that of
the main building or 20 feet, whichever is greater. Detached accessory
buildings shall be located behind the main building.
(Ord. 1568, passed 9-11-07)
§ 157.024  C-0 PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS OFFICES DISTRICT.

   This commercial district is intended for a unified grouping, in one or more
buildings, of retail shops and stores and personal services that provide for
the regular needs and are for the convenience of the people residing in the
adjacent residential neighborhoods. It is intended that the convenience center
be developed as a unit with adequate off-street parking space for customers and
employees and with appropriate landscaping and screening.
(`93 Code, § 12-212)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.026  C-2 HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL AND COMMERCIAL RECREATION DISTRICT.
   This commercial district is established as a district in which the principal
use of land is for establishments offering accommodations, supplies or services
to motorists and for certain specialized uses such as retail outlets, extensive
commercial amusements and service establishments which may serve the entire
community but do not and should not locate in the central business district or
the convenience district.
(`93 Code, § 12-213)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.027  C-3 GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.

District or areas of mixed business enterprises. It will not normally be
applied in the case of new commercial areas.
(`93 Code, § 12-214)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.027-A  CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.

(Ord. 1411, passed 9-8-03)
§ 157.028  I-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the I-1 Industrial District is to provide a location for
industries. The intent is to preserve this land especially for industry in
locations with access to major streets, as well as locations generally
accessible to railroad transportation. Because of possible objectionable
influences that may be created in this district, it is necessary to locate I-
1 carefully in relation to other districts and provide such features as buffers
or setback strips between this district and other zoning districts.
(`93 Code, § 12-215)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.029  I-2 MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the I-2 Medium Industrial District is to provide a location
for industries which may by their nature create nuisances. The intent is to
preserve this land especially for industry in locations with access to major
streets as designated on the major street plan, as well as locations generally
accessible to railroad transportation. Because of the nuisances or other
objectionable influences that may be created in this district, it is necessary
to provide a buffer or setback strip between this district and other zoning
districts, except I-1.

physical disorders. This district shall be for the location of facilities
providing such services and includes Dentistry, Chiropractic, Optometry,
Opthalmology and other related services.

§ 157.031  USES PERMITTED IN DISTRICTS.
   (A)   (1)   The uses permitted in the various districts are shown in
division (C) of this section. The uses permitted in a more restricted district
may be permitted in a less restricted district; provided, however, that the
yard space and other requirements of the more restricted district shall apply.
For purposes of applying this rule each district shown in the subsequent list
shall be considered to be more restrictive than the one listed to the right.
      (2)   Adult-oriented establishments as defined by §
110.060 of this code shall not be located within any use district except as
indicated on the table in this section.
   (B)   It is intended that these regulations be interpreted as permitting a
dwelling unit to be located on the same lot with or within a structure used or
intended to be used primarily for nonresidential purposes only upon individual
review and approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council.
   (C)   The City of Durant is hereby divided into 13 use districts. The most
restrictive use district being R-1 and the least restrictive being I-2. The

   (A)   Purpose.  The architectural design guidelines of this section are
intended to preserve historical, cultural, and architectural character and
development patterns compatible with new construction and major modifications
in order to respect the original architectural character and development
patterns within the city.
   (B)   Applicable zones. Facade treatments for metal buildings will be
required for properties zoned all Commercial Districts (C-0, C-1, C-2, C-3,
CBD), all Residential Districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4), and Health Facilities
District (H-1). The provisions of this section will not apply to properties
zoned General Agricultural District (A-1) and Industrial Districts I-1 and I-2.
   (C)   Facade treatments. Facade treatment will be on all facades visible
from the street but not to include the rear of the structure. The facade
treatment shall cover 100% of the front exterior facing the street, or on a
corner lot, the front and side facing the street. The sides will have 25% of
the area improved with facade treatment floor (bottom) to deck (top), and shall
be constructed using the recommended and acceptable materials listed below in
division (D)(3), excluding the window areas.
   (D)   Facade design. All visible building facades shall conform to the
following design criteria.
      (1)   Windows and glazing. All facades visible from the street must
contain glazed glass windows. Windows shall be recessed and include visually
obvious sills. Columns and mullions, shall form spaces between windows or
material found elsewhere on the facade. Clear window glass is recommended;
green, blue, bronze, or smoke tints are permitted. Window shapes shall be
rectangular, square, or Palladian (mostly rectangular with semi-circular top).
Glazing shall comply with Chapter 24 or the 2003 International Building Code or
the latest version thereof. The maximum permitted reflectance of glass used as
a facade material varies depending upon where the glass is used. The
reflectance of glass used on the first two stories may not exceed 15%. The
reflectance of glass used above the first two stories may not exceed 27%.
      (2)   Building materials. Building materials must be consistent with the
surrounding neighborhood character, as determined by the Community Development
Director or his/her designee. Building materials on the front facade, or any
facade visible from a public right-of-way, must be primarily of natural
materials conveying permanence, as determined by the Community Development
Director or his/her designee.
      (3)   Recommended and acceptable materials. Brick, stone, wood siding,
concrete slab (poured-in-place, tilt-up construction). Split face, scored, or
ground face block, or brick veneer, vinyl siding, beveled wood siding (lap,
board and batter, shake), stucco, and exterior insulation finish systems
(EIFS).
      (4)   Disallowed materials. Metal siding (standing seam panels, aluminum
siding, "R" panels), mirrored or reflective glass.
   (E)   Architectural features. These architectural design guidelines are
intended to preserve the architectural character while encouraging adaptive
reuse of existing buildings, and allowing for compatible new construction and
major modifications. Building facades shall contain architectural features,
details, and ornaments that are consistent with predominating architectural
styles found within the district, such as: arches; roof cornices; contrasting
bases; contrasting masonry courses, water tables, or molding; pilasters or
columns; corbeling; contrasting bands or color; stone or ceramic accent tiles;
colonnades; or porches. Elements such as wall clocks, decorative light
fixtures, and door or window canopies are recommended. Architectural features
will be consistent with the residential neighborhood or the business area.
   (F)   Compliance. If there is a question as to interpretation of any
provision of this section, a written request can be filed with the Community
Development Department for administrative review and action. A review can be
submitted to the Planning Commission and that decision may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
§ 157.070  PUD PURPOSES.
   (A)   The purposes of Planned Unit Development are:
      (1)   To permit flexibility that will encourage a more creative approach
in the development of land and will result in a more efficient use of open area
or will facilitate orderly land use transitions, while maintaining density and
area coverage permitted in the general zoning district or districts in which
the project is located;
      (2)   To permit flexibility in design, placement of buildings and use of
open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas and to best
utilize the potential of sites characterized by special features of geography,
topography, parcel size or shape or proximity to sensitive land use areas.
   (B)   It is the intent of this section to provide for a change in the size
of tracts in which a Planned Unit Development is permitted:
      (1)   Minimum district area.  Eligible properties must normally be two
acres or larger in size (gross acreage).
      (2)   Slightly smaller parcels, between one and two acres, may be
eligible, provided the applicant can show that the proposed Planned Unit
Development can meet the intent and regulation of this subchapter without
injury to the public health safety and welfare. 
   (C)   In every instance, the PUD is to be reviewed as to the proposed
location and character of the uses and the treatment of the development of the
tract. The regulations of the general zoning district or districts remain
applicable except as specifically modified pursuant to the provisions of this
section. No modification of use or bulk and area requirements of the applicable
general use district or districts shall be permitted unless a subdivision plat
or replat incorporating the provisions and requirements of this section is
submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council and
filed of record in the office of the County Clerk.

04)
§ 157.071  USES PERMITTED IN PUDS.
   The primary uses in a Planned Unit Development shall be those permitted in
the zoning districts involved or those uses permitted in more restrictive
zoning districts (for example, in a commercial district a Planned Unit
Development could be dominated by shopping facilities or apartments, but in a
multi-family residential district the predominate land use would have to be
housing). In predominantly residential PUDs certain other principal uses, other
than dwellings, which are permitted by right or exception in the residential
districts may be included within a PUD, if such uses do not occupy more than
10% of the gross area of the PUD and are designed and located to be compatible
with the residential uses of the PUD and with the residential use of adjacent
properties. It is intended that the PUD provisions may be used as an
alternative approach in the processing of all types of developments.
(`93 Code, § 12-252)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.072  PUD ACCESSORY USES.
   (A)   Accessory uses customarily incident to the  principal uses included
within the PUD are permitted. Accessory signs shall comply with the provisions
of the zoning districts except as hereafter provided for accessory commercial
uses.
   (B)   Within a PUD in a residential district, accessory commercial
facilities may be included in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   In considering commercial uses as a part of a Planned Unit
Development in a residential district, the Planning Commission shall consider:
         (a)   The relationship of the proposed commercial use to:
            1.   The land parcel (both as to boundary shape and topographic and
other physical features);
            2.   The land and land uses outside the proposed development;

§ 157.073  PUD AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   The space required in a Planned Unit Development project, including lot
area, area per unit and percent of lot coverage, exclusive of the area of
public or private streets, shall meet the requirements of the districts wherein
the project is located (as set out in §
157.022); provided, however, that upon a finding that the PUD proposal is so
designed as to provide the best use of the land with, at the same time, a good
and full protection of the public welfare and the general intent and spirit of
the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance the Planning Commission may
award an increase in the density of development not to exceed 10% of that
otherwise allowable in the districts in which the PUD is located. If the
project area falls in two or more zoning districts, the space requirements of
the project shall be established by calculating the requirements of the various
districts as applied to the amount of area in each district. In a Planned Unit
Development all area used for development purposes, including recreating areas,
open space areas, parking lots and similar space may be counted as part of the
aggregate development area for computation of space requirements. The area of
Planned Unit Development shall be considered as one parcel regardless of the
extent to which the area may be divided by interior streets or other features.
(`93 Code, § 12-254)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.074  PUD HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
   The height of buildings shall not be more than one and one-half times the
distance between the building line and the edge of pavement of the nearest
street. The building measurement shall be from the ground floor level to the
eave or top of the vertical wall should there be no eave. The Planning
Commission upon review of plans for a Planned Unit Development may approve
buildings of greater height than otherwise permitted in the zoning district.
(`93 Code, § 12-255)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.075  PUD PERIMETER REQUIREMENTS.
   The building setback from the exterior boundaries of the PUD shall not be
less than the minimum yards customarily required for the district or districts
in which located; provided that within 200 feet of any abutting property in a
residential district, structures exceeding ten feet in height measured from the
ground floor to the eave or top of vertical wall if there is no eave shall
conform to the setback requirements of the zoning district plus two feet of
setback for each one foot of building height exceeding ten feet measured from
the ground floor level to the eave or top of vertical wall if there is no eave.
An unenclosed off-street parking area, containing five or more spaces, shall be
screened from adjoining areas in a residential district by the erection of a
screening wall, fence or hedge of acceptable design along the lot line or lines
in common with the residential district, provided that if the parking area is
located more than 50 feet from the residential district, the Planning
Commission may waive screening requirements.
(`93 Code, § 12-256)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.076  PUD OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as specified for the
applicable use. The Planning Commission may consider designs providing for
reasonable sharing of parking spaces by land uses which have inherently
compatible time demands for parking. Required spaces may be provided on the lot
containing the units for which it is intended to serve or in common areas. A
common parking area shall be designed and located so as to be accessible to the
units it is intended to serve. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of
a common parking space as will insure its continuity and conservation shall be
incorporated in the subdivision plat.
(`93 Code, § 12-257)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.077  ADMINISTRATION OF PUD.
   (A)   Procedural steps include:
      (1)   Outline development plan;
      (2)   Supplemental designation PUD; and
      (3)   Subdivision plat.
   (B)   The following may apply for PUD:
      (1)   Any person, corporation, partnership, association or combination
thereof owning or possessing a property right or interest in or to a tract of
not less than five acres in size may make application for the approval of an
outline development plan as provided in divisions (2) and (3);
      (2)   Any person, corporation, partnership, association or combination
thereof owning or possessing a property right or interest in or to a tract of
not less than one acre in size may make application for the supplemental
district designation PUD. Such application shall be accompanied by an outline
development plan processed in the manner set forth in subsections (2), (3) and
(4); and
      (3)   In areas of existing development, any person, corporation,
partnership, association or combination thereof may propose the redevelopment
or reuse of land through the processing of a PUD application. Due to the
previous division of land areas in already developed areas, the Planning
Commission shall determine if a proposed site is suitable for development as a
PUD. The Planning Commission and City Council may place the supplemental
designation PUD upon locations through the established zoning amendment
process.
   (C)   An application for a Planned Unit Development shall be filed with the
Planning Commission. The application shall be accompanied by the payment of a
fee equal to that for rezoning applications which shall include advertising and
sign costs. The application shall be in such form and content as the Planning
Commission may by resolution establish, provided that three copies of an
outline development plan shall accompany the filing of the application. The
outline development plan shall consist of maps or text which contain:
      (1)   Existing topographic character of the land and any topographic
changes which are proposed;
      (2)   Proposed land uses, including public uses and open space and the
approximate location of buildings and other structures;
      (3)   The character and approximate density of development. Density shall
be expressed in numbers of dwelling units and quantitative areas of each
identifiable segment of the development;
      (4)   The approximate location of thoroughfares;
      (5)   Sufficient surrounding area to demonstrate the relationship of the
development to adjoining uses, both existing and proposed;
      (6)   An explanation of the character of the planned development; and
      (7)   The expected schedule of development.
   (D)   The Planning Commission, upon the filing of an application for the
supplemental district designation PUD or the filing of an application for the
approval of an outline development plan, shall set the matter for public
hearing and give 15 days notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation. Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission,
additional notice shall be given by the posting of a sign or signs on the
property. Within 60 days after the filing of an application, the Planning
Commission shall conduct the public hearing and shall determine:
      (1)   Whether the proposal is consistent with the comprehensive plan;
      (2)   Whether the proposal harmonizes with the existing and expected
development of surrounding areas;
      (3)   Whether the proposal is a unified treatment of the development
possibilities of the project site;
      (4)   Whether the proposal would benefit orderly and proper development
of the city; and
      (5)   Whether the sidewalks and streets provide a traffic flow compatible
with the development and surrounding street pattern.
      (6)   Where a supplemental district designation PUD is required for the
processing of a Planned Unit Development, the Planning Commission shall forward
its recommendation, the application and the outline development plan to the
City Council for further hearing as provided in divisions (4), (5) and (6).
Where Planned Unit Development may be processed without the supplemental
designation PUD (five acres or larger), the Planning Commission shall approve,
approve with modification or disapprove the outline development plan. Approval
by the Planning Commission shall be authorization for the processing of a
subdivision plat incorporating the provisions of the outline development plan.
The Planning Commission, upon approval of the outline development plan, may
direct that a notation indicating the boundaries of the PUD be made on the
zoning map.
   (E)   Upon receipt of the application, outline development plan and Planning
Commission recommendation, the City Council shall hold a hearing, review the
outline development plan, approve, disapprove, modify or return the outline
development plan to the Planning Commission for further consideration. Upon
approval, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect the supplemental
designation PUD, and the applicant shall be authorized to process a subdivision
plat incorporating the provisions of the outline development plan.
   (F)   A Planned Unit Development subdivision plat shall be filed with the
Planning Commission and shall be processed in accordance with the subdivision
regulations shall include:
      (1)   Details as to the location of uses and street arrangement;
      (2)   Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of any common open
space as will reasonably insure its continuity and conservation. Open space may
be dedicated to a private association or to the public, provided that a
dedication to the public shall not be accepted without the approval of the City
Council; and
      (3)   Such covenants as will reasonably insure the continued compliance
with the approved outline development plan. In order that the public interest
may be protected, the city shall be made beneficiary of the covenants
pertaining to such matters as location of uses, height of structures, setbacks,
screening and access. Such covenants shall provide that the city may enforce
compliance therewith.
   (G)   After the filing of an approved PUD subdivision plat, and notice
thereof to the Building Inspector, no building permits shall be issued on lands
within the PUD except in accordance with the approved plat. A building permit
in a residential PUD for a free standing or separate commercial structure shall
not be issued until significant progress has been made on other aspects of the
proposed development as follows:
      (1)   Completion of one-third of the noncommercial features in a project
of less than five acres;
      (2)   Completion of one-half of the noncommercial features in a project
of more than five acres; and
      (3)   The Commission has received a satisfactory progress report.
   (H)   Minor changes in the platted PUD may be authorized by the Planning
Commission upon a review of a proposed amended subdivision plat, incorporating
such changes, so long as substantial compliance is maintained with the outline
development plan and the purposes and standards of the PUD provisions hereof.
Changes which would represent a significant departure from the outline
development plan shall require formal abandonment and the subsequent filing of
a new application for a Planned Unit Development.
   (I)   Where a Planned Unit Development has been processed pursuant to the
supplemental designation of PUD, its abandonment shall require the City
Council’s approval, after recommendation by the Planning Commission, of an
application for amendment to the zoning map repealing the supplemental
designation of PUD. Where a Planned Unit Development has been processed by
reason of being more than ten acres, its abandonment shall require the approval
of the Planning Commission and vacation of the plat.
   (J)   Any person aggrieved may appeal the final action of the Planning
Commission on a proposed outline development plan or on a proposed subdivision
plat to the district court by filing with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission within ten days after the action appealed from a notice of appeal
stating the grounds thereof. There shall be no right of appeal from any act of
the Planning Commission taken in its advisory capacity to the City Council.

(`93 Code, § 12-296)  (Ord. 1040, passed 4-12-83)
§ 157.192  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   The following procedure is established to integrate properly the
conditional uses with the other land uses located in the district. These uses
shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the  following procedure:
      (1)   An application shall be filed with the office of the City Planning
Commission for review. Such application shall be in such form and content as
the Planning Commission may by resolution establish;
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall within 45 days of the date of the
application transmit to the City Council its report as to the effect of such
proposed building or use upon the character of the neighborhood, traffic
conditions, public utilities and other matters pertaining to the general
welfare and the recommendation of the Planning Commission;
      (3)   The Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council may
establish such  conditions which in its judgment would carry out the purpose
and intent of these regulations as a condition or conditions to the permitting
of such conditional use. Thereupon the City Council may authorize or deny the
issuance of a building permit for the use of land or buildings as requested;
      (4)   For each application for a conditional use permit, a fee as set by
the City Council by motion or resolution shall be paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer. The cost of legal publication and required notices shall be the
responsibility of the applicant, also each applicant shall submit an accurate
legal description and map of the land and existing buildings. A certified
abstractor's list of all owners of property located within 300 feet of subject
property shall be submitted;
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall publish a notice of the public
hearing in an official paper or a newspaper of general circulation in the city
at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing giving the time and
place of the public hearing and the proposed conditional use. Notice shall be
mailed to all owners of property located within 300 feet of the subject
property at least 20 days prior to the hearing;
      (6)   The City Council may make its approval of any conditional use
permit subject to conditions when in its judgment compliance of the applicant
to the conditions would diminish adverse impact of the desired use on
surrounding uses. The conditions to be met shall be made an integral part of
the City Council action authorizing the conditional use permit.
   (B)   The following are suggested permit conditions:
      (1)   The use is specifically identified and conforms to conditions
listed in the zoning regulations;
      (2)   The proposed use is not injurious to the present use of the land
nor prevents enjoyment of uses already permitted;
      (3)   The change should not impede normal or orderly development or
improvement of surrounding property;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities are provided;
      (5)   Sufficient off-street parking and loading spaces are available;
      (6)   The conditional use does not create a nuisance (odors, fumes, dust,
noise and the like) in the area;
      (7)   If the use requires the applicant to obtain a license or permit
from any other regulatory or governmental entity, such permit or license has
been obtained;
      (8)   The permit is subject to periodic review and must be renewed as set
out in these regulations. Any violation of the conditions results in automatic
termination. If not used, conditional use permits are void after one year;
      (9)   The permit is not transferrable from one applicant to another, so
that a change in possession of the property terminates a permit. Caveat: A new
permit must be issued to any subsequent applicant who can satisfy the permit
conditions;
      (10)   A permit or license fee may be charged in an amount which reflects
the administrative costs of regulating the conditional use program.

§ 157.999  PENALTY.
   A violation of these regulations shall be deemed a misdemeanor and shall be
punishable as provided in §
10.99. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a
separate offense.

      (1)   Although the resulting sign will not be in conformance in all
respects with the provisions of the signage regulations, a sign permit may be

nuisance, or block the sign triangle within the city.
   (B)   Illumination of signs. The artificial illumination of signs, either

      (3)   Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as
to be confused or construed as traffic control devices;
      (4)   Reflective type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed 15 watts

because of changes in use or tenants; and

overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this
chapter.
   (F)   Revisions to comprehensive sign programs. Revisions to a comprehensive
sign program may be approved by the Director if the intent of the original
approval is not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the

section shall be stored by the city for 30 days, during which they may be
recovered by the owner only upon payment to the city for costs of removal and
storage. If not recovered within the 30-day period, the sign and supporting
structure shall be declared abandoned and title shall vest with the city. The
costs of removal and storage (up to 30 days) may be billed to the owner. If not
paid, the applicable costs may be imposed as a tax lien against the property.
