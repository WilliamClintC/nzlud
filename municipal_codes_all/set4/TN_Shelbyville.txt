Preface
This code is the result of a comprehensive codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Shelbyville, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to ascertain
the old code section or ordinance from which the particular section has been
revised. The absence of a historical citation means that the section was added
at the time this code was prepared. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates substantial modification of the cited code section or ordinance.
The attention of the user is directed to the arrangement of the code into
titles, chapters, and sections, which follows that used in the Tennessee Code
Annotated. Related matter is kept together, so far as possible, within the same
title. Each section number is complete within itself, containing the title
number, the chapter number, and the section of the chapter of which it is a part.
Specifically, the first number is the title number followed by a hyphen, then the
chapter number with the last two numbers showing the section number within
the chapter, so that, for example, title 10, chapter 2, section 6, is designated as
section 10-206.
By utilizing the thumb tabs and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should readily find all provisions in the code relating to
any question which might arise.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance
for the code).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is furnished
to MTAS after its adoption (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(3) That the city agrees to reimburse MTAS for the actual cost of
reproducing replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the
consultant's work, and reproduction costs are usually nominal).
iii
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume or amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date. If this very simple procedure is followed the code will
be kept up to date in a way that will serve fully the needs of the city's officials
and citizens. If any questions or problems arise concerning the updating
procedure, an MTAS Ordinance Codification Consultant is available to the city
for advice and assistance.
The able assistance of Mrs. Tracy G. Gardner, the MTAS Sr. Word
Processing Specialist who did all the typing on this project, is gratefully
acknowledged.

TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT REGULATIONS

1-1502. Travel requests.
1-1503. Travel documentation.
1-1504. Transportation.
1-1505. Lodging; meals; miscellaneous expenses; entertainment.

1-1507. Travel reconciliation.
1-1508. Special circumstances.
1-1509. Disciplinary action.
1-1501. Travel policy. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, the term '"traveler" or "authorized traveler" means any elected or
appointed municipal officer or employee, including members of mayor and city
council and committees appointed by the mayor or the city council, the
employees of such boards and committees and all other municipal employees
who are traveling on official municipal business and whose travel was
authorized in accordance with this policy. Members of advisory boards and
commissions desiring to travel on city business shall file a written request to
travel with the city manager. (Ord. #496, Sept. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #582,
Oct. 1997, and Ord. #2013-931, Dec. 2013)
1-1502. Travel requests. To ensure reimbursement for official travel, an
approved travel authorization form is required. Lack of pre-approval does not
prohibit reimbursement, but it does assure reimbursement within the limits of
the city travel policy. All costs associated with the travel should be reasonably
estimated and shown on the travel authorization form. The authorized traveler
also shall indicate:
(1) That the proposed travel is approved in the present budget; and
(2) The line item that will be used to pay for the travel.
Any travel advance must be approved by the city manager. An approved
authorization form is needed before advanced expenses are paid or travel
advances are authorized. A copy of the conference program, if applicable, should
be attached to the form. If the program is not available prior to the travel,
submit it with the reimbursement form.
The municipality may pay directly to provider for expenses such as meals,
lodging, and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars, and other
education programs. (Ord. #496, Sept. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #582, Oct. 1997,
and Ord. #2013-931, Dec. 2013)
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-36
1-1503. Travel documentation. To qualify for reimbursement, travel
expenses must be:
(1) Directly related to the conduct of the city business for which the
travel was authorized; and
(2) Actual, reasonable, and necessary under the circumstances. The
city manager may make exceptions for unusual circumstances.
(3) It is the responsibility of the authorized traveler to:
(a) Prepare and accurately describe the travel;
(b) Certify the accuracy of the reimbursement request;
(c) Note on the reimbursement form all direct payments and
travel advances made by the city; and
(d) File the completed reimbursement form with the necessary
supporting documents and original receipts.
(4) The reimbursement form must include director's signature and
should be filed with the purchasing office within ten (10) days of return or at the
end of the month, whichever is more practical. (Ord. #496, Sept. 1993, as
replaced by Ord. #582, Oct. 1997, amended by Ord. #785, Nov. 2005, and
replaced by Ord. #2013-931, Dec. 2013)
1-1504. Transportation. (1) All potential costs should be considered when
selecting the modes of transportation. For example, airline travel may be
cheaper than automobile when time away from work and increased meal and
lodging costs are considered. When time is important, or when the trip is so long
that other modes of transportation are not cost beneficial, air travel is
encouraged.
If the traveler goes outside the state by means other than air, the
reimbursement will be limited to air fare at tourist or economy class, mileage to
and from the nearest airport, ordinary expenses during the meeting dates, and
one day's meals and motel before and after the meeting. The traveler will be
required to take annual leave for any additional time taken beyond the day
before and after the meeting dates.
(2) Exceptions. When the traveler extends the trip with personal time
to take advantage of discount fares, the reimbursement will be limited to the
less of:
(a) The actual expenses incurred; or
(b) The amount that would have been incurred for the business
portion only.
The calculations for the business portion of the trip must be made
using the least expensive rates available. All expenses and savings
associated with extending the trip must be submitted with the expense
reimbursement form.
(i) Air. When possible, the traveler should make full use
of discounts for advance airline reservations and advance
registration. The traveler should request conference, government,
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-37
or weekend rates, whichever is cheaper, when making lodging or
rental car reservations. The city will pay for tourist or economy
class air travel. The traveler should get the cheapest reasonable
fare and take advantage of "super saver" or other discount fares.
Airline travel can be paid by direct billing to the city.
Mileage credits for frequent flyer programs accrue to the
individual traveler. However, the city won't reimburse additional
expenses, such as circuitous routing, extended stays, layovers to
schedule a particular carrier, upgrading from economy to first class
for travelers to accumulate additional mileage or for other personal
reasons.
The city won't reimburse travel by private aircraft unless
authorized advance by the city manager.
(ii) Rail or bus. The city will pay for actual cost of ticket.
(iii) Vehicles. Automobile transportation may be used
when a common carrier cannot be scheduled, when it is more
economical, when a common carrier is not practical, or when
expenses can be reduced by two (2) or more city employees
traveling together.
(A) Personal vehicles. Employees must use city
vehicles when possible. Use of a private vehicle must be
approved in advance by the city manager. The city will pay
a mileage rate equal to the current milage rate paid by the
State of Tennessee. The miles for reimbursement shall be
paid from origin to destination and back by most direct
route. Necessary vicinity travel related to official city
business will be reimbursed. However, mileage in excess of
the Rand-McNally mileage must be documented as
necessary and business-related. If an indirect route is taken,
the Rand-McNally milage table will be used to determine
the mileage to be reimbursed.
If a privately owned automobile is used by two or
more travelers on the same trip, only the traveler who owns
or has custody of the automobile will be reimbursed for
mileage. It is the responsibility of the traveler to provide
adequate insurance to hold harmless the city for any
liability from the use of the private vehicle.
In no event will mileage reimbursement, plus vicinity
travel and associated automobile costs, exceed the lowest
reasonable available airfare and associated air fare travel
costs.
Travelers will not be reimbursed for automobile
repair or breakdowns when using their personal vehicle.
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-38
(B) City vehicle. The city will require the employee
to drive a city vehicle if available. If a city vehicle is
provided, the traveler is responsible for seeing that the
vehicle is used properly and only for acceptable business.
The employee will be reimbursed for expenses directly
related to the actual and normal use of the city vehicle when
proper documentation is provided. Out-of-town repair cost
to the city vehicle in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
must be cleared with the proper city officials before the
repair is authorized. Anyone driving a city vehicle must
have a valid driver's license in his or her name.
(C) Rental cars. Use of a rental car is not
permitted unless it is less expensive or otherwise more
practical than public transportation. Approval of car rental
is generally required in advance by the city manager.
Always request the government or weekend rate, whichever
is cheaper. Anyone who uses a rental car for out-of-state
travel must obtain liability coverage from the vendor. In
nearly all cases, an intermediate size automobile is the most
appropriate vehicle to rent.
Fines for traffic or parking violations will not be
reimbursed by the city.
Reasonable tolls will be allowed when the most direct
travel route requires them.
(D) Taxi, limousine, and other transportation
fares. When an individual travels by common carrier,
reasonable fares will be allowed for necessary ground
transportation. Bus or limousine service to and from
airports should be used when available and practical. The
city will reimburse mileage for travel to and from the local
airport and parking fees, provided such costs do not exceed
normal taxi/limousine fares to and from the airport.
Receipts are required.
For travel between lodging quarters and meetings,
conferences, or meals, reasonable taxi fares will be allowed.
Original receipts are required for claims of five dollars
($5.00) or more. Transportation to and from shopping,
entertainment, or other personal trips is the choice of the
traveler and not reimbursable.
Reimbursement claims for taxis, limousines, or other
ground transportation must be listed separately on the
expense reimbursement form, claiming the destination and
amount of each fare. (Ord. #496, Sept. 1993, as replaced by
Ord. #582, Oct. 1997, amended by Ord. #636, March 2000,
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-39
and Ord. #785, Nov. 2005, and replaced by Ord. #2013-931,
Dec. 2013).
1-1505. Lodging; meals; miscellaneous expenses; entertainment.
(1) Lodging. The amount allocated for lodging shall be the lowest
possible attainable.
(a) Original lodging receipts must be submitted with the
reimbursement form. Photocopies are not acceptable.
(b) Moderately priced accommodations must be requested
whenever possible. It will be the traveler's responsibility to provide
documentation of the "officially designated meeting site" room rates.
(c) If two (2) or more city employees travel together and share
a room, the lodging reimbursement rate will be the maximum of two (2)
single rooms.
(2) Meals. Authorized travelers shall be reimbursed for the actual,
reasonable and necessary expenses for meals consumed while on official city
travel. The city will only pay reasonable and customary amount for meal
expenses. This is subject to a maximum amount depending on the location of the
travel. ("Washington, DC" for example). On any authorized travel involving an
overnight stay, expenditures for meals documented by proper receipts will be
reimbursed to authorized travelers according to the following schedule. The
reimbursement schedule may be changed by motion of the city council.
Calculation is based upon: Breakfast ten dollars ($10.00), lunch twelve dollars
($12.00), and dinner eighteen dollars ($18.00).
Full day $40.00
Day of departure, depart before 7:00 A.M. $40.00
Day of departure, depart after 7:00 A.M./before 11:00 A.M. $30.00
Day of departure, depart after 11:00 A.M. $18.00
Day of return, return after 8:00 A.M. $10.00
Day of return, return after 1:30 P.M. $22.00
Day of return, return after 6:00 P.M. $40.00
(3) Miscellaneous expenses. (a) Registration fees for approved
conferences, conventions, seminars, meetings, and other educational
programs will be allowed and generally include the cost of official
banquets, meals, lodging, and registration fees. Registration fees should
be specified on the original travel authorization form and can include a
request for pre-registration fee payment.
(b) A four dollar ($4.00) allowance in any one (1) day will be
reimbursable for hotel/motel check-in and check-out baggage handling
expenses.
(c) Laundry services are considered personal expenses and are
not reimbursable.
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-40
(d) For travel outside the United States, all expenses claimed
must be converted to U.S. dollars. The conversion rate and computation
should be shown on each receipt.
(4) Entertainment. (a) The city may pay for certain entertainment
expenses provided that:
(i) The entertainment is appropriate in the conduct of
the city business;
(ii) The entertainment is approved by the city manager;
(iii) The group or individuals involved are identified; and
(iv) Documentation is attached to the expense form to
support the entertainment expense claims.
(b) To request reimbursement for authorized entertainment
expenses, be sure to include with the expense reimbursement form:
(i) Required receipts. All requests must be supported by
original; receipts from the vendor (restaurant, caterer, ticket office,
etc.). Reasonable tips and gratuities are reimbursable.
(ii) A disclosure and explanation statement explaining
the purpose of the entertainment and identifying the group and
the number of people entertained (or individual names listed if not
a recognized group). (Ord. #496, Sept. 1993, as replaced by Ord.
#582, Oct. 1997, and Ord. #2013-931, Dec. 2013)
1-1506. Non-reimbursable items. The following items are only given as
a guideline and not necessarily a complete list of things for which the city will
not provide reimbursement: airline or other travel insurance, barbers and
hairdressers, spa/salon services, kennel costs for pets, golf fees, alcoholic
beverages, car washes for employee-owned vehicles, traffic fines and parking
tickets, or accidents and breakdowns in employee-owned vehicles. (Ord. 496,
Sept. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #582, Oct. 1997, and Ord. #2013-931, Dec. 2013)
1-1507. Travel reconciliation. (1) Within ten (10) days of return from
travel, or by the end of the month, the traveler is expected to complete and file
the expense reimbursement form. It must be certified by the traveler that the
amount due is true and accurate. Reimbursement form must be signed by
employee's supervisor, travel reimbursement shall be approved by the city
manager. Original lodging, travel, taxi, parking, and other receipts must be
attached.
If the city provided a travel advance or made advanced payment, the
traveler should include that information on the expense form. In the case of
advances, the form should have a reconciliation summary, reflecting total
claimed expenses with advances and city pre-payments indicated. The balance
due the traveler or the refund due the city should be clearly shown--below the
total claim on the form or in a cover memo attached to the front of the form.
Change 11, April 9, 2015 1-41
(2) If the traveler received a travel advance and spent less than the

officials and personnel of the City of Shelbyville. It applies to all full-time and
part-time elected or appointed officials and employees, whether compensated or
not, including those of any separate board, commission, committee, authority,

official or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.

interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1603. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An official
with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the meeting
at which the vote takes place, before the vote and so it appears in the minutes,

that it affects the officials vote on the measure. In addition, the official may
recuse himself1 from voting on the measure. (as added by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1604. Disclosure of personal interest in non-voting matters. An official
or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other than
casting a vote, and who has a personal interest in the matter that affects or that
would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or
1Masculine pronouns include the feminine. Only masculine pronouns
have been used for convenience and readability.
Change 8, July 10, 2008 1-44
policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter. (as added
by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1605. Acceptance of gratuities, etc. An official or employee may not
accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration or
favor of any kind from anyone other than the city:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
(2) That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business. (as
added by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1606. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to

make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the name
of the city.

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the city. (as added by
Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1609. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept or
continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the city's charter or any ordinance or policy. (as added by
Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
Change 8, July 10, 2008 1-45

ethics officer of the city. Upon the written request of an official or employee
potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney may render
an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter and other
applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation, and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorneys
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request the city council to hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the city council, the city council
shall either determine that the complaint has merit, determine that the
complaint does not have merit, or determine that the complaint has
sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the city council
determines that a complaint warrants further investigation, it shall
authorize an investigation by the city attorney or another individual or
entity chosen by the city council.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics. (as added
by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)
1-1611. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipalitys charter or other applicable law,
and in addition is subject to censure by the city council. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (as added by Ord. #806, Dec. 2006)

2-222. Beer licenses not to be issued when congestion of traffic,
interference with schools, etc., will result. No license or permit to store, sell,
distribute, or manufacture any beverage covered by this chapter, at any place
or places in the city, shall be issued by the board to any person, when such
storage, sale, distribution, or manufacture will cause or will be likely to cause
(as determined by the board) congestion of traffic or interference with schools,
churches, or other places of public gathering, or residential areas, or otherwise
interfere with, injure, adversely affect, or be likely to interfere with, injure, or
adversely affect the public health, safety, and morals, as hereinafter in this
section more fully defined. The board is especially charged with the duty, upon
application for such license or permit, to inquire into and determine whether or
not the granting of such license or permit for the place or places stated in the
application will cause, or be likely to cause, congestion of traffic or such
interference or injury, or have, or be likely to have, such adverse effect. If it
finds that such congestion of traffic or interference or injury or adverse effect
will be caused, or is likely to be caused, it shall deny such application. The board
shall presume conclusively that the issuance of a license for on premises
consumption of beer for a location adjacent to residentially zoned property would
be likely to have an adverse effect upon the residential area, and it shall deny
the application; provided however, this conclusive presumption shall not apply
where the permit or license holder would otherwise be entitled to sell alcoholic
beverages for on-premises consumption under Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 57-4-101.
The board, in determining whether or not such storage, sale, distribution
or manufacture of any such beverage at any place or places for which a license
or permit is applied for, will cause or be likely to cause congestion of traffic, or
interference with schools, churches, or other places of public gathering, or
residential areas, or will interfere with, or be likely to interfere with, injure, or
adversely affect the public health, safety, and morals, shall give consideration
to the following, among other facts, conditions and circumstances:
The proximity of such places to schools, churches, or other public places;
whether such place or places are in a business or residential section of the city
and the general nature of the neighborhood in which such place or places are
situated together with the probable effect upon the public health, peace, quiet,
rest, sleep, safety, and morals; the amount, condition, and effect of traffic, both
pedestrian and vehicular, at, by, or near such place or places; whether or not the
storage, sale, distribution, or manufacture of such beverage at such place or
places would be likely adversely to affect the full but usual prior use, occupation,
and enjoyment of property in the same locality; whether or not the storage, sale,
distribution, or manufacture of such beverage at such place or places would be
likely to cause unusual or large congestion of persons or unusual noises and
disturbances, or would be likely to disturb the peace, quiet, rest, or sleep of
citizens; whether or not the city police, giving due consideration to the number
of police on the city's police force and to the location of such place or places in
Change 11, April 9, 2015 2-17
reference to the location of police headquarters, the public square, and the fire
zone, can adequately patrol and police such place or places; whether or not such
place or places are situated in a locality adjacent to or near any bawdy house or
house of ill-fame or adjacent to or near a house reputed to be a bawdy house or
house of ill-fame; the number and location of other places in the same
neighborhood or locality for which licenses or permits to store, sell, distribute,
or manufacture beer have been issued by the city; the experience of the city with
any other place or places in the same locality or neighborhood where such
beverage is then or has previously been stored, sold, distributed or
manufactured, with reference to the effect thereof upon traffic, schools,
churches, or other places of public gathering, and upon the public health, safety,
quiet, peace, rest, sleep and morals, and especially with reference to whether or
not the operation of any such other place in the same locality or neighborhood
has previously created disturbances and disorders and whether or not such
places have been frequented by drunks, or persons of bad reputation or public
prostitutes, or have been the scene of fights, brawls, or killings; and any other
fact, condition, or circumstance that would be relevant to the inquiry. The
enumeration of the foregoing facts, conditions, and circumstances shall not be
construed as exclusive. The board is expressly authorized and required to take
into consideration all facts, conditions, and circumstances, whether so
enumerated or not, that may be relevant upon the inquiry as to whether or not
the storage, sale, distribution, or manufacture of any such beverage at any such
place or places will cause or be likely to cause congestion of traffic, or
interference with schools, churches, other places of public gathering, or
residential areas, or will interfere with, or be likely to interfere with, injure, or
adversely affect, the public health, safety and morals. (1979 code, § 2-223, as

inflicted the particular injury difficult to ascertain, then regardless of the degree
of participation by the individual dog(s), all such dogs shall be deemed
dangerous dogs.
(7) Transfer of ownership prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any
person who has been served with a citation to appear in a court of competent
jurisdiction for the purpose of determining whether such person's dog should be
designated as a dangerous dog to transfer ownership of such dog until after the
court has issued a ruling on such citation. It shall be unlawful for any person
whose dog has been designated as a dangerous dog to transfer ownership of such
dog to another person without:
(a) Having advised such other person that the dog has been
designated as a dangerous dog; and
(b) Having advised such other person in writing of the
restrictions that have been placed upon such dog.
(8) Court imposes restrictions. Upon designating a dog as a dangerous
dog, the court shall impose the restrictions on the owner of such dog as set forth
in this chapter and may impose such additional restrictions as are appropriate
under the circumstances of the case. The court shall reduce such restrictions to
writing and have them served on the respondent. If the owner or keeper of the
dog(s) is absent from the hearing, he or she shall be notified by the court in
writing of the decision of the court and of any restrictions imposed upon the
respondent, either personally through animal control or by first-class mail,
postage prepaid. If a dog is declared to be dangerous, the owner or keeper shall
comply with all restrictions imposed by this chapter and by the court.
(9) Mandatory restrictions for dangerous dogs. Once the court of
competent jurisdiction designates the dog as a dangerous dog, the following
shall be restrictions that are mandatory upon the owner or custodian of such
dog:
(a) The dog must be kept securely confined indoors, within an
automobile or other vehicle, or confined in a securely enclosed and locked
Change 8, July 10, 2008 3-10
pen or structure upon the premises of the owner of such dog. Such pen or
enclosure must have secure sides and a secure top. If the pen or structure
has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the
ground no less than two (2) feet.
(b) The owner must allow inspection of the dog and its enclosure
by animal control and must produce, upon demand, proof of compliance
with such restrictions.
(c) In the event that the owner or custodian of the dog is a
tenant on real property where the dog is being kept, the owner or
custodian must obtain written permission, to be filed with the animal
control department, to keep the dog on certain specified premises from
the landlord or property owner.
(d) The owner or custodian shall post a sign having reflective
letters and backing with letters measuring at least 1.5 inches in width
and 1.5 inches in height and reading "Beware of Dangerous Dog" in a
conspicuous place at all entrances to the premises on or within which
such dog is kept.
(e) A dangerous dog shall not be permitted to leave the premises
of the owner unless such dog is properly restrained and humanely
muzzled for protection of persons and other animals.
(f) A dangerous dog may never, even with the owner present,
be allowed to be unrestrained on property that allows the dog direct
access to the public.
(g) The owner of a dangerous dog shall not permit such a dog to
be chained, tethered or otherwise tied to any inanimate object such as a
tree, post or building, inside or outside of its own separate enclosure.
(h) The owner of the animal or owner of the premises on which
the animal is kept shall obtain and maintain public liability insurance in
a single incident amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)
for bodily injury to or death, or damage to personal property of, any
person which may result from the owning, possessing, keeping or
maintaining of such animal. Such insurance policy shall provide that no
cancellation of the policy will be made unless ten (10) days written notice
is first given to the city recorder.
(i) The owner or custodian shall have an identification
microchip implanted in the dog, and provide the identification number of
the chip to the animal control office.
(j) The owner of such dog shall register the dangerous dog with
the animal control department, and provide and maintain a record that
lists the dog owner(s) or agent contact information, emergency contact
persons and phone numbers, veterinarian, landlord or property owner
contact information, property/liability insurance carrier, vaccination,
licensing and permit number, photo of the animal and any other
information deemed necessary by animal control.
Change 8, July 10, 2008 3-11
(k) Any other reasonable requirement specified by the court.
(10) Removal of designation of dangerous dog. No sooner than twelve
(12) months after a court of competent jurisdiction has designated a dog a
dangerous dog, the owner may petition animal control for a review of the
circumstances of the dog and for a report for the court, and may thereafter
petition the court to remove the designation upon a showing that changes in
circumstances or measures taken by the owner or keeper, such as training of the
dog, training of the owner, confinement, etc., have mitigated the risk to the
public safety.
(11) Impoundment of dogs threatening public safety. (a) If upon
investigation it is determined by the animal control officer or law
enforcement officer that probable cause exists to believe a dog poses an
immediate threat to public safety, then the animal control officer or law
enforcement officer may immediately seize and impound the dog pending
a hearing to be held pursuant to this chapter. At the time of an
impoundment pursuant to this subsection or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the officer shall serve upon the owner or custodian of the dog
a notice of hearing to be held pursuant to this chapter to declare the dog
dangerous.
(b) Any animal control officer may impound any designated
dangerous dog if the animal control officer has reasonable cause to
believe that any of the mandatory restrictions upon such dog are not
being followed, if the failure to follow such restrictions would likely result
in a threat to public safety. The owner or custodian of a dangerous dog
shall surrender such a dog to any animal control officer or law
enforcement officer upon demand. In the event such dog is impounded,
the animal control officer shall serve a citation upon the owner of such
dog for violation of the provisions of this chapter.
(c) If a dog has been impounded pursuant to subsection (a) or
subsection (b), the animal control director may permit the dog to be
confined at the owner's expense in a veterinary facility pending a hearing
pursuant to this chapter, provided that such confinement will ensure the
public safety.
(d) No dog that has been designated by the court as a dangerous
dog may be released by animal control or a veterinarian until the owner
has paid all veterinarian costs and all other fees and costs of the animal
control shelter that are normally charged to an owner prior to redemption
of the animal. If the owner fails to pay such fees and costs and take
possession of the dog within ten (10) days of the owner's receipt of notice
of the designation of the dog as a dangerous dog, the dog shall be deemed
to have been abandoned and may be disposed of by animal control.
Euthanasia or surrender to animal control of such a dog does not free the
owner of responsibility for all cost incurred up to and including the date
of euthanasia or surrender.
Change 8, July 10, 2008 3-12
(12) Destruction of dogs previously found to be dangerous. If any dog
which has previously been found to be "dangerous" as is described herein shall
be at large and shall attack or bite a human being, upon report to the animal
control officer said dog shall be impounded and shall be confined the number of
days as prescribed by the state health department and after said time shall be
destroyed in a humane manner upon notice to the owner of said dog as is
prescribed in § 3-207 of this chapter.
(13) Change of ownership, custody or location, or death of dog. (a) The
owner or custodian of a designated dangerous dog who moves or sells the
dog, or otherwise transfers the ownership, custody or location of the dog,
shall, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the actual transfer or removal of
the dog, notify animal control in writing of the name, address and
telephone number of the proposed new location of the dog, and the name
and description of the dog.
(b) The owner or custodian shall, in addition to the above, notify
any new owner or custodian of a designated dangerous dog in writing
regarding the details of the dog's record and the terms and conditions for
confinement and control of the dog. The transferring owner or custodian
shall also provide animal control with a copy of the notification to the new
owner or custodian of his or her receipt of the original notification and
acceptance of the terms and conditions. The new owner or custodian
shall comply with all court restrictions.
(c) If a designated dangerous dog should die, the owner or
custodian shall notify animal control no later than twenty-four (24) hours
thereafter and, upon request, from animal control shall produce the
animal for verification or evidence of the dog's death that is satisfactory
to animal control.
(d) If a dangerous dog escapes, the owner or custodian shall
immediately notify animal control and make every reasonable effort to
recapture the escaped dog to prevent injury or death to humans or
domestic animals.
(e) The following persons must notify animal control when
relocating a dog to Shelbyville even on a temporary basis:
(i) The owner of a dangerous dog that has been
designated as such by another lawful body other than Shelbyville;
and
(ii) The owner of a dog that has had special restrictions
placed against it by any humane society or governmental entity or
agency other than Shelbyville based upon the behavior of the dog.
No such designation as a dangerous dog or any other similar such
designation shall be recognized by Shelbyville if such designation is based
solely on the breed of the dog. Such owner is subject to the restrictions
set forth in this chapter. (1979 Code, § 3-206, as replaced by Ord. #295,
§§ 6 and 7, and Ord. #821, June 2007)
Change 8, July 10, 2008 3-13
3-207. Impoundment of dogs and cats. (1) It shall be the duty of the city
police, animal control or rabies control officer or other authorized persons to
seize and impound when found or come across by the officer, any "stray dog,"
"dangerous dog," dog reported or suspected of having rabies, dog or cat which is
found to be a "nuisance," all as defined herein, or any dog or cat found "at large"
or otherwise in violation of this chapter. It shall be required that any dog that
has bitten a human being or has shown symptoms of rabies or is for any reason
suspected of having rabies shall be reported by any citizen with knowledge of
same to the animal or rabies control officer and said dog shall be immediately
impounded, isolated, and confined under the supervision and observation of a
licensed veterinarian and the animal control officer in the city animal shelter
for such time as the veterinarian and the rabies control officer deem it necessary
to protect the safety of the people and/or property. The animal may be
quarantined at the facility of a licensed veterinarian with the permission of the
animal control officer. In addition to the impoundment fee and boarding fees
provided for in this chapter, the owner of said dog impounded for having bitten
a human being or suspected of or showing symptoms of rabies shall pay a fee as
set by resolution of the city council, which fee shall defray the expenses of the
veterinarian under whose supervision the dog must be kept. All of said fees
must be paid before the dog is relinquished to the owner at the end of the
confinement.
(2) If the owner of any dog or cat confined under paragraph (1) of the
section shall contest the validity or basis of said confinement, he shall file a
petition contesting same before the city manager within five (5) days from the
date of notice of confinement sent to him as is hereinafter provided or within five
(5) days of confinement and the burden of proof shall be upon said owner to
establish that said dog or cat was not validly confined under the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this section. The decision of the city manager in such cases
shall be binding and final except that the owner shall have a right to appeal
such case to a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) The animal control officer shall keep a record of each dog confined
under paragraph (1) of the section, and all pertinent information relating to the
dog, its license and its owners, which report shall be furnished to the city
manager. (as added by Ord. #821, June 2007)
3-208. Impounded dog procedures; disposition. (1) If an impounded dog
or cat is wearing a tag, the owner shall be notified on the day the dog is
impounded, by postcard addressed to his last known mailing address to appear
before the person designated in said notice (city manager or animal control
officer) within five (5) days from the date of said notice and, except as
hereinafter provided, to redeem his dog by paying such fees as are set by
resolution of the city council and the payment of any license fee or, penalty
assessed, if any, due at the time of impoundment. The said dog or cat may be
disposed of by adoption, under terms imposed by paying the same fees, as if he
Change 8, July 10, 2008 3-14
were the owner, including the pound fee, board fee and veterinary fee under
terms imposed by the city manager, or by humane destruction; provided
however, that if said impounded dog is a "dangerous dog," or a "nuisance," as
defined herein, said dog shall not be released except under conditions prescribed
by this chapter and the city manager. The dog or cat shall not be released to
any group, organization, or person until said release is authorized by the city
manager, provided further that if said dog constitutes a danger to the
community in the opinion of the city manager, said official may order its
destruction, as provided herein.
(2) If said dog or cat is not wearing a tag, the dog so seized and
impounded shall be confined for a period of five (5) days after which it may be
disposed of by adoption under terms imposed by this chapter, and by the
payment of the fees set out in (1) above, or by humane destruction, all as
provided in (1) above.
(3) No dog or cat shall be released in any event from the shelter unless
and until it is in compliance with the Tennessee Spay/Neuter Law, Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 44-17-501, or any successor statute, and it has been
vaccinated and a tag purchased and placed on its collar, and a release fee as set
by resolution of the city council, board bill, and veterinarian fee has been paid.
(4) Any owner wishing to contest the validity or basis for
impoundment of his dog hereunder or any and all other decisions rendered prior
to a formal hearing by the rabies control officer and/or city manager may file a
petition before the city manager contesting same. At the hearing on said
petition the burden of proof shall be upon the owner to prove the lack of basis
for the impoundment of his dog or cat and any and all decisions theretofore
rendered concerning said dog or cat. An owner shall have the right to appeal
any final decision of the city manager upon such a petition and hearing to a
court of competent jurisdiction within the time prescribed by law.
(5) City responsibility while dog or cat confined. The city and its
officials shall not be responsible for any illness, disease, or death occurring to
any dog or cat confined in the city animal shelter. (as added by Ord. #821, June

warrant signed by any person that the owner of a dog or cat is in violation of the
provision of this chapter, the owner shall be required to appear before the court
at the time designated in the citation or warrant to answer the charges brought
against him or her, at which time city officials shall be present and shall present
evidence for consideration by the court. (as added by Ord. #821, June 2007)

at law, the City Shelbyville shall have the right to seek injunctive relief for any
violation of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #821, June 2007)
3-211. Severability. The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared
to be severable. If any of the sections, provisions, sentences, clauses, phrases or
parts hereof be declared unconstitutional or void, the remainder of this act shall

chapter would have been adopted even if such unconstitutional or void matter
had not been included herein. (as added by Ord. #821, June 2007)

5-901. Purpose and findings. This part shall be known as the "Sexually-
Oriented Registration Act of 1998."
(1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither
the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(2) Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to
the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 111 S. Ct. 2456 (1991), Triplett
5-28
Grille, Inc. V. City of Akron, 40 f. 3d 129 (6th cir. 1994), and Northend Cinema
Inc. V. Seattle, 585 P. 2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on studies in other
communities including, not not limited to Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los
Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Memphis, Tennessee; and Beaumont,
Texas; and also on findings found in the Report of Attorney General's Working
Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented businesses, (June 7, 1989, State
of Minnesota), the council finds:
(a) Sexually oriented businesses in the city lend themselves to
ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently
uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is
presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on the premises.
(b) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined
in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incident
of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than
employees of other establishments.
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows,
as defined under this chapter as adult book stores, adult novelty shops,
adult video stores, adult motion picture theatres, or adult arcades.
(d) Offering and providing such space, encourages such
activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
(e) Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, adult
cabarets, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of
engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(f) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
(g) As of June 30, 1995, there have been 5,672 reported cases of
persons with AIDS and 6,277 persons testing positive for the HIV
antibody test in the State of Tennessee.
(h) The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in
the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported
in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990.
(i) The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-million cases
being reported in 1990.
(j) The surgeon general of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986 has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
5-29
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug
abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an
infected mother to her newborn.
(k) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted
by sexual acts.
(l) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,
and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
(m) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen
is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view
"adult" oriented films.
(n) In Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee, deputies and police
officers investigating exotic dance clubs found numerous obscenity
violations, physical contact between fully nude dancers and patrons
including fondling of dancers and full sexual intercourse, a variety of
other sexual contact including fellatio, solicitation offered (sex for hire),
undercover narcotics buys, different acts of violence, runaway juveniles
and allegations of white slavery. Another officer testified that 90-95% of
the dancers use drugs (cocaine, crack, methamphetamine), that clubs do
not report crimes because they do not want police involved, and that he
saw three girls performing five sex acts in 15 minutes. Further, the
Manager of Infectious Disease at Shelby County Health Department
testified that in one topless club, out of 9 females arrested, 8 tested
positive for VD and that there is a very close relationship between
prostitution and these clubs.
(o) Out of 26 females arrested at BOTTOMS UP, a topless bar
in Memphis, 14 had a medical record at the Shelby County STD Clinic.
(p) According to Chattanooga City Police investigating exotic
dance clubs since 1993, there has been a considerable amount of bodily
contact between patrons and dancers, dancers sometimes: sit in patron's
lap; place their breast against the patron's face; while physical contact is
maintained gyrate in such a manner as to stimulate sexual intercourse;
breathe heavily into a patron's groin area; bite at, gnaw at, as well as
fondle, the genitals of male patrons; pulled patrons into their vaginal
areas; allowed patrons to spoon feed themselves with whipped cream that
had been spread on the breasts, vaginal, and anal areas of the dancer;
and have had patrons place a peeled banana between their legs while
female "dancers" have eaten the banana.
(q) The Federal Court for Eastern District of Tennessee at
Chattanooga found that Chattanooga's adult cabarets displayed tactile,
5-30
body contact, sexual experiences tantamount to prostitution as defined in
TCA 39-13-512(5).
(r) The findings noted in paragraphs (a) through (q) raise
substantial government concerns.
(s) Sexually oriented businesses have operational
characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect
those substantial government concerns.
(t) Requiring that entertainers at adult oriented
establishments: not appear in a state of full nudity, without interfering
in their right to free expression, according to the latest restrictive means
possible as found in Barnes v. Glen theatre, Inc., and Triplett Grille, Inc.,
v. City of Akron; not dance closer to patron than six feet; not mingle with
patrons as found in city of New Orleans v. Kiefer 164 Southern Reporter
2d 3367 (Supreme Court of Louisiana 1964); not solicit any pay or
gratuity from any patron as found in KEV v. Kitsap County 793 F.2d
1053 (9th Cir. 1986); and not fondle any patron or other entertainer or
allow any other entertainer or patron to fondle them will help reduce the
incidence of certain types of criminal behavior on the premises of sexually

Change 11, April 9, 2015 5-55
or fireman on the scene of the activated alarm system shall inspect the area
protected by the system and shall determine whether the emergency response
is in fact required as indicated by the alarm system or whether in some way the
alarm system malfunctions and thereby activated a false alarm.
(2) It is hereby found and determined that all false alarms constitute
a public nuisance. The permit holder will be billed a fifty dollars ($50.00) service
charge per false alarm occurrence in any calendar year. Each service charge

city shall conform to the following standards:
(1) The installer of the alarm system may place each alarm so installed
on a thirty (30) day test period to reduce the possibility of false alarms. During
this test period, the alarm installer will notify the fire and police bureaus that
specific alarms are being tested that will not require police or fire response
should an alarm be activated. Since no fire or police response will be required
during the test period, there will be no charge to the alarm user should a false
alarm occur; however any false alarm that results in response by either the fire
or police bureaus will implement the provisions set forth in § 5-1111(1) and (2)
of this chapter.
(2) The installer of any alarm system will maintain a local service
organization within the Middle Tennessee area ("Middle Tennessee area" as
used herein shall mean the counties of Bedford, Giles, Lincoln, Coffee, Wilson,
Moore, Marshall, Rutherford, Davidson, Williamson, and Sumner) capable of
providing necessary service calls of both a maintenance and emergency nature,

attempted on the premises, or otherwise to cause a false alarm.
(2) It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, or use an audible alarm
system which can sound continually for more than ten (10) minutes.
(3) It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, or use an automatic dial
protection device that reports, or causes to be reported, any recorded message
to the Shelbyville Police Department. (as added by Ord. #2015-954, Feb. 2015)
5-1118. Permits--denial; revocation. (1) The chief of fire, chief of police,
or chief building official may deny any application for an alarm installation
permit, or revoke such permit, if the applicant or any or the applicant's owners,
partners, or principal corporate officers have:
(a) Knowingly and willfully submitted any false information of
a material nature in connection with the application for a license or
reinstatement thereof.
(b) Been convicted in any jurisdiction of a felony or a

5-1120. Government immunity. Alarm registration is not intended to, nor
will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of
response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the
failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental
immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm registration,
Change 11, April 9, 2015 5-57
the alarm user acknowledges that the Shelbyville Police Department response
may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of
calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels
and prior response history. (as added by Ord. #2015-954, Feb. 2015)

8-321. Confidential information. Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the User specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Shelbyville
Sewerage System that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the User.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, (NPDES) Permit, state disposal
system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
8-30
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
Information accepted by the Shelbyville Sewerage System as confidential,
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the Shelbyville Sewerage System until and unless a ten-day notification is given
to the User. (as added by ord. No. 350)
8-322. Harmful contributions. The Shelbyville Sewerage System may
suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution
permit when such is necessary, in the opinion of the Shelbyville Sewerage
System, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare
of persons, to the environment, causes Interference to the POTW or causes the
Shelbyville Sewerage System to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Shelbyville Sewerage System shall take such
steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals, the Shelbyville Sewerage System shall
reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment
upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written
statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the Shelbyville Sewerage System within 15 days of the date of
occurrence. (as added by ord. No. 350)

provide a hearing regarding any order of termination or refusal of water service;
provided however, that when an order is issued pursuant to sub-section (3) of
this section, such hearing may be held after such termination or refusal, but not
later than five (5) working days after receipt of the request. Any customer
aggrieved by such an order may appear in person, or by legal counsel, and show
cause why an order to terminate water service, or to refuse water service, should
be rescinded.
(5) Failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public
water system as prohibited by this chapter or Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711 within the time limits set by the general manager or this chapter,
shall be cause for denial or termination of water service. If proper protection is
not provided after a reasonable time, the general manager or his/her designated
representative shall give the customer written notification that water service is
to be discontinued, and thereafter physically separate the public water system
from the customer's system in such manner that the two systems cannot again

sanitary sewer and all building sewers from the building to the
POTW sanitary sewer shall be inspected by the general manager
before the underground portion is covered.
(ii) The applicant for discharge shall notify the control
authority when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the POTW sanitary sewer. The connection shall be
made under the supervision of the general manager.
(d) Maintenance of building sewers. Each user shall be entirely
responsible for the maintenance of the building sewer located on private
property to insure that the building sewer is watertight. This
maintenance will include repair or replacement of the building sewer as
deemed necessary by the control authority to meet specifications of the
city. If, upon smoke testing or visual inspection by the general manager,
roof downspout connections, exterior foundation drains, or other sources
of rainwater, surface runoff or groundwater entry into the POTW sewer
system are identified on building sewers on private property, the control
authority may take any of the following actions:
(i) Notify the user in writing of the nature of the
problem(s) identified on the user's building sewer and the specific
steps required to bring the building sewer within the requirements
of this ordinance. All steps necessary to comply with this ordinance
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-82
must be complete within sixty (60) days from the date of the
written notice and entirely at the expense of the user.
(ii) Notify the user in writing of the nature of the
problem(s) identified on the user's building sewer and inform the
user that the city will provide all labor, equipment and materials
necessary to make the repairs required to bring the building sewer
within the requirements of this ordinance. The work on private
property will be performed at the city's convenience and the cost of
all materials, labor and equipment used will be charged to the
user. The city will be responsible for bringing any excavations back
to original grade, replacing topsoil and hand raking all disturbed
areas; however, the user shall be responsible for final landscaping,
including but not limited to seeding, fertilizing, watering,
mulching, sodding and replacing any shrubbery or trees displaced
or damaged by the city during the execution of the work.
(3) Prohibited discharge standards. (a) General prohibitions. No user
shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or
wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general
prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not the user is
subject to categorical pretreatments standards or any other national,
state or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(b) Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or
wastewater:
(i) Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their
nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by
interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be
injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the
POTW. At not time shall two (2) successive readings on an
explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the POTW
system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent
(5%) nor any single reading over ten percent (10%) of the Lower
Explosive Limit (LEL) of the meter or have a closed-cup flashpoint
of less than one hundred forty degrees (140E) F (sixty degrees
(60E) C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline,
kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols,
ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates,
carbides, hydrides, sulfides and any other substance which the
city, the state, or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a
hazard to the system.
(ii) Solid or viscous substances which may cause
obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the
operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-83
limited to: grease garbage with particles greater than one-half inch
(1/2") or one and twenty-seven hundredths (1.27) centimeters in
any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones,
hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass,
straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops,
waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues
from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass
grinding or polishing waxes.
(iii) Any wastewater having a pH less than five (5) or
wastewater having any other corrosive property (such as pH over
ten (10)) capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW.
(iv) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants which
result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the
POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
(v) Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or
other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life
(acute worker health and safety problems) or are sufficient to
prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(vi) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent
or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or
scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere
with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations
developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or
regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.
(vii) Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate
its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards.
Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test.
(viii) Any wastewater with objectionable color which causes
discoloration of the POTW treatment plant effluent to the extent
that the NPDES permit is violated, such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
(ix) Any wastewater heat in amounts which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-84
temperature at the POTW exceeds forty degrees (40E) C (one
hundred four degrees (104E) F).
(x) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants, such as BOD5, NH3-N, and oil and grease, released at
a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or
by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference to the
POTW. In no case shall a discharge to the POTW have a flow rate
or contain concentrations or quantities of pollutants that exceed for
any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than (5)
times the average twenty-four (24) hour concentration, quantities,
or flow during normal operation.
(xi) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits
established by the control authority in compliance with applicable
state or federal regulations.
(xii) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life
or creates a public nuisance.
(xiii) Any wastewater containing fats, wax, grease,
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral
oil origin, or other substances which may solidify or become viscous
at temperatures between zero degrees (0E) C (thirty-two degrees
(32E) F) and forty degrees (40E) C (one hundred four degrees
(104E) F) and/or cause interference or pass through at the POTW
treatment plant.
(xiv) Any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or
unpolluted industrial process waters. Stormwater and all other
unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to storm sewers, or to a
natural outlet approved by the control authority and the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation. Industrial cooling
water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval
of the control authority and the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
(xv) Any trucked or hauled pollutants except at discharge
points designated by the POTW in accordance with § 8-1003(4) of
this chapter.
(xvi) Fats, oils, and grease, waste food, and sand. Refer to
§ 8-1002(4) for guidelines.
When the control authority determines that a user is contributing to the
POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, the control authority shall:
(a) Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW; and
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-85
(b) Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not
be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the
POTW.
(4) Fats, oils, and grease, waste food, and sand guidelines. Fats, oil,
grease, waste food, and sand in the POTW can interfere with the collection
system and wastewater treatment facility by causing blockages and plugging of
pipelines, problems with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and
contribute waste of a strength or form that is beyond the treatment capability
of the treatment plant.
(a) Interceptors. Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG), waste food, and
sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the control
authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing fats, oils, and grease, ground food waste, sand, soil, and solids,
or other harmful ingredients in excessive amounts which impact the
POTW. Such interceptors shall not be required of single-family
residences, but may be required for multiple-family residences. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the control
authority, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
(i) Fats, oil, grease, and food waste.
(A) New food service facility. On or after the
effective date of this ordinance, food service facilities which
are newly proposed or constructed, shall be required to
install, operate and maintain a grease interceptor with a
minimum capacity of seven hundred fifty (750) gallons
located on the exterior of the building. Approval of the
installation of a grease trap instead of a grease interceptor
at a new food service facility can be obtained for those
facilities where inadequate space is available for the
installation of a grease interceptor. Design criteria shall
conform to the standard in accordance with any provisions
of the plumbing code as adopted by the City of Shelbyville
and Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation engineering standards or applicable local
guidelines.
(B) Existing food service facilities. On or after the
effective date of this ordinance, existing food service
facilities or food service facilities which will be expanded or
renovated shall install a grease trap or grease interceptor
when, in the opinion of the control authority, necessary for
the control of FOG and food waste. Upon notification, the
facility must be in compliance within ninety (90) days
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-86
(unless due case of hardship may be proven). The facility
must service and maintain the equipment in order to
prevent adverse impact upon the POTW. If in the opinion of
the control authority the user continues to impact the
POTW, additional pretreatment measures may be required.
(ii) Sand, soil, and oil. All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, and other sources of sand, soil, and oil
shall install effective sand, soil, and oil interceptors when directed
by the control authority. These interceptors shall be sized to
effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the proper flow rates.
These interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent
impact upon the POTW. Owners whose interceptors are deemed to
be ineffective by the control authority may be asked to change the
cleaning frequency or to increase the size of the interceptors.
Owners or operators of washing facilities shall prevent the inflow
of rainwater into the sanitary sewer.
(iii) Laundries. Where directed by the control authority
commercial laundries shall be equipped with an interceptor with
a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that
prevents passage into the POTW of solids one-half inch (1/2") or
larger in size such as strings, rags, buttons, or other solids
detrimental to the POTW.
The equipment or facilities installed to control FOG, food
waste, sand, and soil shall be designed in accordance with the
plumbing code and Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation engineering standards or applicable local guidelines.
Underground equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow
of rainwater and easily accessible to allow regular maintenance
and inspection. Control equipment shall be maintained by the
owner or operator of the facility so as to prevent a stoppage of the
public sewer, and the accumulation of FOG in the POTW. If the
control authority is required to clean out the public sewer lines as
a result of a stoppage resulting from poorly maintained control
equipment, or lack thereof, the owner or operator shall be required
to refund the labor, equipment, materials and overhead costs to
the control authority. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit or restrict any other remedy the control authority has
under this ordinance, or state or federal law.
The control authority retains the right to inspect and approve
installation of the control equipment.
There shall be no charge for random inspections conducted by the
control authority personnel on traps or interceptors. If a trap or
interceptor has to be re-inspected because of deficiencies found during the
previous inspection by the control authority personnel, and all of the
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-87
deficiencies have been corrected, there shall be no charge for the
reinspection. If all of the deficiencies have not been corrected, a first
re-inspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be charged to the facility.
If a second re-inspection is required, a second reinspection fee of one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be charged to the facility if all of the
deficiencies have still not been corrected. If three (3) or more
re-inspections are required, a re-inspection fee of three hundred dollars
($300.00) for each successive re-inspection shall be charged to the facility
in addition to other enforcement actions if all of the deficiencies have not
been corrected.
(b) Solvents. The use of degreasing or line cleaning products
containing petroleum-based solvents is prohibited.
(5) National categorical pretreatment standards. Users must comply
with the categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing sources set out
in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471 and shall serve as the
minimum requirements.
(a) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the control authority may impose equivalent concentration
or mass limits in accordance with § 8-1002(5)(e) and (f) as allowed at
40 CFR 403.6(c).
(b) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable
to the individual industrial users as allowed at 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2).
(c) When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard,
the control authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5).
(d) A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with the following subsections of
this section as allowed at 40 CFR 403.15.
(i) Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted
to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake
water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing
to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the
city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard
will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e. adjusted to reflect credit for
pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of subsection
(ii) of this section are met.
(ii) Criteria. (A) Either:
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-88
(1) The applicable categorical pretreatment
standards contained in 40 CFR, chapter I,
subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or
(2) The industrial user demonstrates that
the control system it proposes or uses to meet
applicable categorical pretreatment standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the
standards in absence of pollutants in the intake
waters.
(B) Credit for generic pollutants such as
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Suspended
Solids (TSS), and oil and grease shall not be granted unless
the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of
the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially
similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the
intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are
placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or
elsewhere.
(C) Credit shall be granted only to the extent
necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent
value. Additional monitoring (at the person's, applying for
credit, expense) may be necessary to determine eligibility
for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under
this section.
(D) Credit shall be granted only if the user
demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same
body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The
board may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
(e) When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only
in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that
the board convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination
to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of
the control authority. The board may establish equivalent mass limits
only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections
(5)(e)(i)(A) through (E) below.
(i) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the
industrial user must:
(A) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ,
water conservation methods and technologies that
substantially reduce water use during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge or general permit;
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-89
(B) Currently use control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have
used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(C) Provide sufficient information to establish the
facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams,
based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring
device, as well as the facility's long-term average production
rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the
long-term average production rate must be representative
of current operating conditions;
(D) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or
pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent
mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge;
and
(E) Have consistently complied with all applicable
categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior
to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(ii) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits
must:
(A) Maintain and effectively operate control and
treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with
the equivalent mass limits;
(B) Continue to record the facility's flow rates
through the use of a continuous flow monitoring device;
(C) Continue to record the facility's production
rates and notify the control authority whenever production
rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent
(20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
subsection (5)(e)(i)(C) of this section. Upon notification of a
revised production rate, the control authority will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary
to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(D) Continue to employ the same or comparable
water conservation methods and technologies as those
implemented pursuant to subsection (5)(e)(i)(A) of this
section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass
limit.
(iii) When developing equivalent mass limits, the control
authority:
(A) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by
multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the
regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-90
standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;
(B) Upon notification of a revised production rate,
will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the
facility; and
(C) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in
subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms
if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was
reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual
average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of
the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of
dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to
subsection (10). The industrial user must also be in
compliance with § 8-1013(3) regarding the prohibition of
bypass.
(D) The control authority may convert the mass
limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR
parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes
of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial
users. The conversion is at the discretion of the control
authority. When converting such limits, the control
authority will use the concentrations listed in the applicable
subparts of 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 and document
that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as
prohibited in § 8-1002(10) of this chapter (see 40 CFR
403.6(d)). In addition, the control authority will document
how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from
concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this
information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).
(E) Once included in its permit, the industrial user
must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in
this § 8-1002(5) in lieu of the promulgated categorical
standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
(F) Many categorical pretreatment standards
specify one (1) limit for calculating maximum daily
discharge limitations and a second for calculating monthly
average, or four (4) day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow
figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the
maximum equivalent limitation.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-91
(G) Any industrial user operating under a permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits
calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the
control authority within two (2) business days after the user
has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any
user not notifying the control authority of such anticipated
change will be required to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate
of the long term average production rate.
(6) Modification of national pretreatment standards. If the POTW
system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by the national
pretreatment standards, the board may apply to the approval authority for
modifications of specific limits in the national pretreatment standards.
"Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or
alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the POTW system to a less toxic or
harmless state in the effluent whish is achieved by the system in ninety-five
percent (95%) of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures
set forth in 40 CFR section 403.7(a)(3)(ii) part 403 - General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant
to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the national
pretreatment standards if the requirements continued in 40 CFR, part 403,
section 403.7, are fulfilled and approval is obtained from the approval authority.
(7) State pretreatment standards. Users must comply with Tennessee
Pretreatment Standards codified at Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 69-3-101, et
seq. and 4-5-201, et seq.
(8) Local limits. (a) The control authority is authorized to establish
local limits pursuant to Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.05(3).
(b) Specific pollutant limitations. Pollutant limits are
established to protect against pass through and interference. No person
shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the limits for each
pollutant. Refer to Appendix A (latest revision), Table A1: Specific
Pollutant Limitations for a list of the specific pollutants and respective
concentrations.
(c) Criteria to protect the POTW treatment plant influent. The
general manager and/or his designated representative shall monitor the
POTW treatment plant influent for each parameter in Table A2: Criteria
to Protect the POTW Treatment Plant Influent contained in Appendix A
(latest revision). Analyses for all pollutants listed at Table A2 shall be
conducted in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 136 or
equivalent methods approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. All industrial users shall be subject to the reporting
and monitoring requirements set forth in § 8-1007, Reporting
Requirements, and § 8-1008, Compliance Monitoring, as to these
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-92
parameters. In the event that the influent at the POTW treatment plant
reaches or exceeds the levels established by said table, the control
authority shall initiate technical studies to determine the cause of the
influent violation, and shall recommend to the Shelbyville Power, Water
and Sewerage Board such remedial measures as are necessary, including,
but not limited to recommending the establishment of new or revised
pretreatment levels for these parameters. The control authority shall also
recommend changes to any of these criteria in the event the POTW
effluent standards are changed or in the event that there are changes in
any applicable law or regulation affecting same or in the event changes
are needed for more effective operation of the POTW.
(d) Conventional pollutants. (i) BOD5, TSS and NH3-N. The
POTW treatment plant was designed to accommodate specific
waste load concentrations and mass amounts of Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and
Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N). If an industrial user discharges
concentrations of these pollutants in excess of the criteria to
protect the POTW treatment plant influent listing at Table A2 in
the appendix (latest revision) of this ordinance, added operation
and maintenance costs will be incurred by the POTW. Therefore,
any industrial user who discharges concentrations in excess of the
criteria to protect the POTW treatment plant influent listed at
Table A2 in the appendix (latest revision) of this ordinance for any
of the conventional pollutants such as BOD5, TSS, and/or NH3-N
will be subject to a surcharge. The formula for this surcharge is
listed in § 8-1004(3) of this chapter. The board also reserves the
right to, at any time, place specific mass or concentration limits for
BOD5, TSS and/or NH3-N on the industrial user if the industrial
user's discharge of the excessive strength wastewater causes the
POTW treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit.
(ii) Oil and grease. Oil and grease loadings were not
taken into account in the design of the POTW treatment plant;
however, oil and grease are regulated under this ordinance as
conventional pollutants.
If an industrial user discharges concentrations of total oil
and grease in excess of the criteria to protect the POTW treatment
plant influent listed in § 8-1002(7)(c) of this chapter for total oil
and grease, added operation and maintenance cost will be incurred
by the POTW. Therefore, any industrial user who discharges
concentrations in excess of the criteria to protect the POTW
treatment plant influent listed in § 8-1002(7)(c) for total oil and
grease will be subject to a surcharge. The formula for this
surcharge is listed in § 8-1004(3) of this chapter. The board also
reserves the right to, at any time, place specific mass or
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-93
concentration limits for total oil and grease on the industrial user
if the industrial user's discharge of the excessive strength
wastewater causes the POTW treatment plant to violate its
NPDES permit.
(e) The control authority and/or his designated representative
may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), in individual
wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, to implement local
limits and the requirements of § 8-1002(3).
(9) Board's right of revision. The board reserves the right to petition
the City of Shelbyville to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater
discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on users of the POTW system if deemed necessary to comply with
the objectives presented in this ordinance.
(10) Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or
in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.
The control authority and/or his designated representative may impose mass
limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
(11) Accidental discharges. (a) Protection from accidental discharge.
Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this ordinance.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the control authority for review, and
shall be approved by the control authority before construction of the
facility. No industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date of this ordinance shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have
been approved by the control authority. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from
the responsibility to modify the industrial user's facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this ordinance.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge. In the case of an
accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall be within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation and shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions. The industrial user
shall repeat the sample within five (5) days, perform an analysis, and
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-94
report the results of the sample analysis to the control authority within
thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the violation [(40 CFR 403.12)(g)].
(i) Written notice. Within five (5) days following an
accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the control
authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
ordinance or other applicable law.
(ii) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently
posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous
accidental discharge. Industrial users shall insure that all
employees who may cause such a dangerous discharge to occur or
may suffer such are advised of the emergency notification
procedure. (Ord. #528, Sept. 1995, as replaced by Ord. #706, Jan.
2003, Ord. #758, Dec. 2004, and Ord. #863, Nov. 2008, and
amended by Ord. #869, April 2009)
8-1003. Pretreatment of wastewater. (1) Pretreatment facilities. Users
shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this ordinance
and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local
limits, and the prohibitions set out in § 8-1002 of this chapter within the time
limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the control authority and/or his
designated representative, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary
for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's
expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the control authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the
control authority before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
board under the provisions of this ordinance.
(2) Additional pretreatment measures. (a) Whenever deemed
necessary, the control authority and/or his designated representative may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage
wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions
as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-95
(b) The control authority may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their
expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization
of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit
may be solely for flow equalization.
(c) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when,
in the opinion of the control authority and/or his designated
representative, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the control authority
and/or his designated representative, shall comply with § 8-1002(4) of this
chapter, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired in
accordance with § 8-1002(4) by the user at their expense.
(d) Users with potential to discharge flammable substances may
be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas
detection meter.
(3) Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The control
authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The control
authority may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement
such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug
discharges. Alternatively, the control authority may develop such a plan for any
user at the user's expense. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(a) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine
batch discharges;
(b) Description of stored chemicals (which shall include cleaning
supplies);
(c) Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority
of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 8-1007(6) of this
chapter; and
(d) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any incidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling, and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment,
measures for containing toxic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
(4) Hauled wastewater. (a) Septic tank waste may be introduced into
the POTW only at locations designated by the control authority, and as
such times as established by the control authority and/or his designated
representative. Such waste shall not violate § 8-1002 of this chapter or
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-96
any other requirements established by the board. The control authority
may require septic tank haulers to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits or general permit.
(b) The control authority may require haulers of industrial
waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general
permits. The control authority may require generators of hauled
industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or
general permits. The control authority may also prohibit disposal of
hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is
subject to all other requirements of this ordinance.
(c) Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at
locations designated by the control authority and/or his designated
representative. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the
control authority and/or his designated representative. The control
authority and/or his designated representative may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The
control authority and/or his designated representative may require the
industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge.
(d) Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form
for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and
address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry,
known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are
RCRA hazardous wastes. (Ord. #528, Sept. 1995, as replaced by
Ord. #706, Jan. 2003, Ord. #758, Dec. 2004, and Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1004. Fees. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide
for the recovery of costs from users of the board's wastewater disposal system
for the administration, operation, maintenance, amortization of debt, and
depreciation of the POTW. The applicable charges or fees are set forth by the
board's schedule of charges and fees.
(2) Charges and fees. The board may adopt charges and fees which
may include:
(a) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating
the POTW's pretreatment program;
(b) Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures
associated with industrial users;
(c) Fees for reviewing accidental/slug discharge
procedures/control plans and construction plans and specifications for
industrial users;
(d) Fees for permit applications;
(e) Fees for FOG plan submittals;
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-97
(f) Fees for inspection of building sewer connections;
(g) Fees for cleaning/removing stoppages from FOG, sand, soil,
oil, and laundry interceptors;
(h) Fees for filing appeals of enforcement actions taken by the
board;
(i) Fees for treating conventional pollutants discharged to the
POTW by industrial users with strengths in excess of the design capacity
of the POTW treatment plant for individual conventional pollutants;
(j) Charges to users for recovery of costs associated with normal
operation, maintenance, administration, amortization of debt and
depreciation of the POTW;
(k) Other fees as the board may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein.
These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this ordinance and are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the board.
(3) Surcharge fees. If an industrial user discharges in excess of the
criteria to protect the POTW treatment plant influent set out for the
conventional pollutants BOD5, TSS, NH3-N, and/or oil and grease in Table A2
of Appendix A (latest revision), additional operation and maintenance costs will
be incurred by the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board. Therefore,
any user who discharges in excess of the limits for any of these parameters will
be subject to a surcharge. Surcharges shall be in addition to normal user fees.
The formula for this surcharge is listed below.
As an alternate to this formula, the Shelbyville Power, Water and
Sewerage Board may calculate surcharge fees based on actual cost caused by the
discharge of excessive strength conventional pollutants. The Shelbyville Power,
Water and Sewerage Board also reserves the right to, at any time, place limits
which may not be exceeded on the industrial user's discharge if the industrial
user's discharge of the excessive strength wastewater cause to the POTW
treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit. (Ord. #528, Sept. 1995, as
replaced by Ord. #706, Jan. 2003, Ord. #758, Dec. 2004, and Ord. #863, Nov.
2008)

(1) Wastewater analysis. When requested by the control authority
and/or his designated representative, a user must submit information on the
nature and characteristics of its wastewater within fifteen (15) days of the
request. The control authority or his designated representative is authorized to
prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update
this information.
There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits:
(a) For connection of residential, commercial and institutional
users to the POTW; and
(b) For connection of industrial users to the POTW.
In either case, the owner of the facility or residence wishing to connect a
building sewer to the POTW or his agent shall make application on a special
form furnished by the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board. The
permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the control authority. A
permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the Shelbyville Power, Water and
Sewerage Board at the time the application is filed as set out in the Shelbyville
Power, Water and Sewerage Board's schedule of charges and fees.
(2) Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit
requirement. (a) No significant industrial user shall discharge
wastewater to the POTW without first obtaining an individual
wastewater discharge permit or general permit from the control
authority, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely
application pursuant to subsection (3) of this section may continue to
discharge for the time period specified therein.
(b) The control authority may require other users to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits as necessary
to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.
(c) Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall be deemed a
violation of this ordinance and subjects the wastewater discharge
permittee to the sanctions set out in §§ 8-1010 through 8-1012 of this
chapter. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or general
permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all
federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements with any other
requirements of federal, state, and local law.
(3) Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting: existing
connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge

allow discharges to the POTW to continue after forty-five (45) days of the
effective date of this ordinance except in accordance with an individual
wastewater discharge permit or general permit issued by the control authority.
(4) Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting; new
connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into
the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of
such discharge. An application for this individual wastewater discharge permit
or general permit, in accordance with subsection (5) of this section, must be filed
ninety (90) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or
recommence.
(5) Individual wastewater discharge and general permit application
contents. (a) General. All users required to obtain an individual

(x) Any other information as may be deemed necessary
by the control authority to evaluate the permit application.
Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the user for revision.
(6) Wastewater discharge permitting: general permits. (a) At the
discretion of the control authority, the control authority may use general
permits to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following condition
are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must:
(i) Involve the same or substantially similar types of
operations;
(ii) Discharge the same types of wastes;
(iii) Require the same effluent limitations;
(iv) Require the same or similar monitoring; and
(v) In the opinion of the control authority, are more
appropriately controlled under a general permit than under
individual wastewater discharge permits.
(b) To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a
written request for coverage that identifies its contact information,
production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for
monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in
accordance with § 8-1007(4)(b) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant
neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, and any other
information the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a
pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is
not effective in the general permit until after the control authority has
provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been
granted in accordance with § 8-1007(4)(b).
(c) The control authority will retain a copy of the general
permit, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a
specific SIU meets the criteria in § 8-1005(6)(a)(i)--(v) and applicable
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-102
state regulations, and a copy of the user's written request for coverage for
three (3) years after the expiration of the general permit.
(d) The control authority may not control an SIU through a
general permit where the facility is subject to production-based
categorical pretreatment standards or categorical pretreatment standards
expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits
are based on the combined wastestream formula (§ 8-1002(5)(c)) or
net/gross calculations (§ 8-1002(5)(d)).
(7) Application signatories and certifications. (a) All wastewater
discharge permit applications, user reports and certification statements
must be signed by a duly authorized representative or the user and
contain the certification statement in § 8-1007(14)(a).
(b) If the designation of a duly authorized representative is no
longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new written
authorization satisfying the requirements of this section must be
submitted to the control authority prior to or together with any reports
to be signed by a duly authorized representative.
(c) A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user by the control authority pursuant to § 8-1001(2)(fff)(iii)
must annually submit the signed certification statement in
§ 8-1007(14)(b).
(8) Individual wastewater discharge and general permit decisions.
The control authority will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may
require additional information. If sufficient data was not received to determine
an industry's category, the control authority may submit a category
determination request to the approval authority as set out in Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14-.06(1). After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the
control authority will determine whether to issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit or a general permit. The control authority may deny any
application for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit.

Individual wastewater discharge and general permits shall be subject to
void upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All
individual wastewater discharge and general permits issued to a user are void
upon the issuance of a new individual wastewater discharge or general permit
to that user.
(6) Individual wastewater discharge and general permit reissuance.
A user with an expiring individual discharge or general permit shall apply for
permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application in accordance
with § 8-1005(5) of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing individual wastewater discharge or general
permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification
by the control authority during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements as identified in § 8-1002 are modified or other just cause exists.
The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty
(30) days prior to the effective date of change unless this allows federal due
dates to be violated. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include
a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(7) Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions. (a) If
another municipality, or user located within another municipality,
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-107
contributes wastewater to the POTW, the control authority shall enter
into an intermunicipal agreement with the contributing municipality.
(b) Prior to entering into an agreement required by
subsection (a) above, the control authority shall request the following
information from the contributing municipality:
(i) A description of the quality and volume of wastewater
discharged to the POTW by the contributing municipality;
(ii) An inventory of all users located within the
contributing municipality that are discharging to the POTW; and
(iii) Such other information deemed necessary by the
control authority.
(c) An intermunicipal agreement, as required by subsection (a)
above, shall contain the following conditions:
(i) A requirement for the contributing municipality to
adopt a sewer use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this
ordinance and local limits, including Baseline Monitoring Reports
(BMRs) which are at least as stringent as those set out in
§ 8-1002(8) of this chapter. The requirement shall specify that such
an ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect
changes made to the board's ordinance and local limits;
(ii) A requirement for the contributing municipality to
submit a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;
(iii) A provision specifying which pretreatment
implementation activities, including individual wastewater
discharge or general permit issuance, inspection and sampling,
and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing
municipality; which of these activities will be conducted by the
control authority; and which of these activities will be conducted
jointly by the contributing municipality and the control authority;
(iv) A requirement for the contributing municipality to
provide the control authority with access to all information that
the contributing municipality obtains as part of its pretreatment
activities;
(v) Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the
contributing municipality's wastewater at the point where it
discharges to the POTW;
(vi) Requirements for monitoring the contributing
municipality's discharge;
(vii) A provision ensuring the control authority access to
the facilities of users located within the contributing municipality's
jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling,

Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-108
(viii) A provision specifying remedies available for breach
of the terms of the intermunicipal agreement.
The intermunicipal agreement may contain provisions for the control
authority has the right to take action to enforce the terms of the contributing
municipality's ordinances or to impose and enforce pretreatment standards and
requirements directly against discharges of the contributing municipality. (as
added by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1007. Reporting requirements. (1) Baseline monitoring reports.
(a) Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final
administrative decision on a category determination under Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing categorical
industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the
information listed in subsection (b), below. At least ninety (90) days prior
to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources becoming
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a
report which contains the information listed in subsection (b), below. A
new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to
meet the applicable categorical standard(s). A new source shall also give
estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be
discharged.
(b) Users described above shall submit the information set forth
below.
(i) All information required in §§ 8-1005(5)(a)(i)(A),
8-1005(5)(a)(ii), 8-1005(5)(a)(iii)(A), and 8-1005(5)(a)(vi).
(ii) Measurement of pollutants.
(A) The user shall provide the information
required in § 8-1005(5)(a)(vii)(A) through (D);
(B) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile the data necessary to
comply with the requirements of this subsection;
(C) Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user
should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula in
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5) to evaluate compliance
with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-109
accordance with Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5) this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the control authority;
(D) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with § 8-1007(10);
(E) The control authority may allow the
submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical
data so long as the data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(F) The baseline report shall indicate the time,
date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and
shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
(iii) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by
the user's authorized representative as defined in § 8-1001(2)(c)
and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and,
if not, whether additional Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(iv) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment
and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards,
the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must
meet the requirements set out in § 8-1007(2) of this chapter.
(v) Signature and report certification. All baseline
monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with section
§ 8-1007(14)(a) of this chapter and signed by an authorized
representative as defined in § 8-1001(2)(c).
(2) Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by § 8-1007(1)(b)(iv) of this
chapter:
(a) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading
to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for
the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events
include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting
routine operation);
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-110
(b) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(c) The user shall submit a progress report to the control
authority no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum,
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for
any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return
to the established schedule; and
(d) In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between
such progress reports to the control authority.
(3) Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the control authority a report containing the information described in
§§ 8-1005(a)(vi) and 8-1007(1)(b)(ii) of this chapter. For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in § 8-1002(5), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production dining the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 8-1007(14)(a) of this
chapter. All sampling will be done in conformance with § 8-1007(11).
(4) Periodic compliance reports. All SIUs and non-significant
categorical industrial users are required to submit periodic compliance reports.
(a) All users must, at a frequency determined by the control
authority, submit no less than twice per year (on dates specified) reports
indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best
Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the control authority or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the user.
(B) The control authority may authorize an industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard (upon the approval
authority's approval) to forego sampling of a pollutant by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through
sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present
nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the
pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. [Tennessee Rule
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-111
1200-4-14-.12(5)(b)] This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
(i) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater
discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater
is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and
otherwise includes no process wastewater.
(ii) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration
of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge
permit, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must
submit a new request (including the requirements of
§ 8-1007(4)(b)(iii) for the waiver before the waiver can be granted
for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See
§ 8-1005(5)(a)(viii).
(iii) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the industrial user must provide sufficient data of the
facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
(iv) The request for monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with § 8-1001(2)(c), and include the certification
statement in § 8-1007(14)(a) [Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14.06(1)(b)(2)].
(v) Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved
method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection
level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(vi) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control
authority must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The
reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by
the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the
control authority and the user for three (3) years after the
expiration of the waiver.
(vii) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision
of the user's permit by the control authority, the industrial user
must include on each submitted report the certification statement
in § 8-1007(14)(c) below, that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user.
(viii) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be
present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur
in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with
the monitoring requirements of § 8-1007(4)(a), or other more
frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control
authority, and notify the control authority.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-112
(ix) This provision does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical
pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the
categorical pretreatment standard.
(c) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified
in accordance with § 8-1007(14)(a) of this chapter. A chain of custody form
must be submitted with all reports.
(d) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(e) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the control authority, using the
procedures prescribed in § 8-1007(11) of this chapter; the results must
included in the report for the corresponding reporting period.
(5) Reports of change conditions. Each user must notify the control
authority of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least one hundred
eighty (180) days before the change.
(a) The control authority may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed as necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 8-1005(5) of this chapter.
(b) The control authority may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit or general permit under § 8-1006(6) of this chapter or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under § 8-1006(3) of this
chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
(6) Reports of potential problems. (a) In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a
non-routine, episodic nature, a uncustomary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the
POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control
authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user. The control authority may request
a sample for analysis be collected at the moment of accidental discharge.
(b) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-113
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may
incur as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user
of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant
to this ordinance.
(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described in subsection (a), above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
(d) Significant industrial users are required to notify the control
authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a slug discharge.
(7) Reports from non-permitted users. All users not required to obtain
an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the control authority as may be required.
(8) Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control
authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation, the
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. Repeat sampling by the industrial user is not required
if the control authority performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the control authority performs sampling at the user between the
time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the
control authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the control authority
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If
sampling performed by the control authority indicates a violation, the control
authority may opt to notify the user of the violation and require the user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis [40 CFR 403.12(g)(2)].
(9) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. (a) Any user who
commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the control
authority, the EPA regional water management division director, and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge to the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous,
batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100)
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification
of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of
the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-114
discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later
than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under § 8-1007(5) of this section. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported
by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the
self-monitoring requirements of § 8-1007(1), (3) and (4) of this section.
(b) Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection
(a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.20(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one (1) time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
control authority, the EPA regional waste management waste division
director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a
permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(10) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the control authority or other parties approved by EPA.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-115
(11) Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the reporting period covered by the report, based on
data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(a) Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control
authority. Where time proportional sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple
grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies
may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits [40 CFR 403.12(g)(3)].
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using
grab collection techniques.
(c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety (90) day compliance reports required in § 8-1007(1) and (3)
[Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(2) and (4)], a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical data are
available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by § 8-1007(4) [Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(5) and (8)],
the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(12) Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed using
the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13) Retention of records. Users subject to the reporting requirements
of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices, as set out in
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-116
individual wastewater discharge or general permits. Records shall include the
date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s)
taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3)
years after the expiration date of the user's permit. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or
the control authority, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the control authority.
(14) Certification statements. (a) Certification of permit applications,
user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification
statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting
permit applications in accordance with § 8-1005(6); users submitting
baseline monitoring reports under § 8-1007(1) [40 CFR 403.12 (1)]; users
submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment
standard deadlines under § 8-1007(3) [40 CFR 403.12 (d)]; users
submitting periodic compliance reports required by § 8-1007(4) [40 CFR
403.12 (e) and (h)], and users submitting an initial request to forego
sampling of a pollutant on the basis of § 8-1007(4) [40 CFR 403.12 (e) (2)
(iii)]. The following certification statement must be signed by an
authorized representative as defined in § 8-1001(2)(c):
"I certify under the penalty of law that this document and
all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision
in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person(s) who manage the system, or
the person(s) directly responsible for gathering the information,
the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including
the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. "
(b) Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial
users. A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial
user by the control authority pursuant to §§ 8-1001(2)(fff)(ii) and
8-1005(6)(c) [40 CFR 403.3 (v) (2)] must annually submit the following
certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory
requirements in § 8-1001(2)(c) [40 CFR 403.120 (1)]. This certification
must accompany an alternative report required by the control authority:
"Based on my inquiry of the person(s) directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment
Standards under 40 CFR Part ___, I certify that, to the best of my

knowledge and belief that during the period from ______, ____ to
______, ____ [month, days, year(s)]:
(i) The facility described as ___________________
[facility name] met the definition of a Non-Significant
Categorical Industrial User as described in
§ 8-1001(2)(fff)(iii);
(ii) The facility complied with all applicable
Pretreatment Standards and requirements during this
reporting period; and
(iii) The facility never discharged more than 100
gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given day
during this reporting period.
This compliance certification is based on the following
information:
________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________"
(c) Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an
approved monitoring waiver based on § 8-1007(4)(b) must certify on each
report with the following statement that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the user.
"Based on my inquiry of the person(s) directly responsible
for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40
CFR Part(s) ______, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, there has been no increase in the level of ________ in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the
last periodic report under§ 8-1007(4)(a)." (as added by Ord. #863,
Nov. 2008)
8-1008. Compliance monitoring. (1) Right of entry: inspection and
sampling. The control authority shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this ordinance and any individual wastewater discharge and general permit or
order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority or his
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and
the performance of any additional duties.
(a) Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guard(s) so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
control authority, approval authority and EPA shall be permitted to
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-118
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities (40 CFR 403.12).
(b) The control authority, approval authority and EPA shall
have the right to set up on the industrial user's property such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering of the user's operations.
(c) The control authority may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices
used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated
annually, unless specified otherwise, to ensure their accuracy. The
location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the
monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples
and on-site analysis (where necessary), whether constructed on public or
private property. The monitoring facilities should be provided in
accordance with the control authorities requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall
be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the control
authority to perform independent monitoring activities.
(d) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control
authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the user.
(e) Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority access
to the user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance. (as added by
Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1009. Confidential information. Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, surveys, permit applications, individual wastewater
discharge or general permits and monitoring programs, and from the control
authority's inspections and sampling activities, shall be available to the public
or other governmental agency without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority,
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user under
applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report, that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this ordinance, the National
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-119
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and/or the state
pretreatment program, and that such portions of a report shall be available for
use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall
not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public
without restriction. (as added by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1010. Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The control
authority shall publish, at least annually, in a newspaper of general circulation
that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the
POTW, a list of users, which at any time during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user
(or any user which violates subsections (3), (4), or (8) of this section) is in
significant noncompliance if its violation meets one (1) or more of the following
criteria:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed on a
rolling quarterly basis (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in § 8-1001(2);
(2) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by § 8-1001(2) multiplied by the applicable TRC
(TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other parameters
except pH);
(3) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by § 8-1001(2) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit,
or narrative standard) that the control authority determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel and/or the general public);
(4) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare, or to the environment or has resulted
in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under 40 CFR
403.8 (f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide, within forty-five (45) days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day compliance
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-120
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the control authority determines
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (as added by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008, and amended by Ord. #869, April
2009)
8-1011. Administrative enforcement remedies. All administrative
enforcement actions taken against a significant industrial user, including
procedures, orders, and complaints, shall be in accordance with the Tennessee
Water Quality Control Act of 1977 and its amendments, specifically Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 69-3-123, and enforcement per the Enforcement Response
Plan (ERP).
(1) Notification of violation. When the control authority finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control
authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10)
days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control authority.
Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in
this section shall limit the control authority to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice
of violation.
(2) Consent orders. The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage
Board is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action
to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the document. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections §§ 8-1004 and 8-1005
of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(3) Show cause hearing. The control authority may order a user which
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before
the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-121
this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user as defined in § 8-1001(2)(c) and
required by § 8-1005(7). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Whether or not a duly
notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 69-3-124.
(4) Compliance orders. When the control authority finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, order issued
hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, the Shelbyville Power,
Water and Sewerage Board may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time
period. If the user does not show compliance within the specified time period,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices
or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated to allow
compliance with this ordinance. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, the installation of pretreatment systems(s), and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. A compliance order may also contain a fine for noncompliance with the
ordinance or an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(5) Cease and desist orders. When the control authority finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit order issued
hereunder, any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's
past violations are likely to recur, the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage
Board may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance
of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(6) Administrative penalties. (a) Notwithstanding any other section
of this ordinance, when the control authority finds that a user has
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-122
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance,
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, and/or orders
issued hereunder, any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority
may penalize such a user in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00). Such penalties shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis in accordance with the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-125, 126, 128 and 129 and 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(A). In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the Shelbyville Power, Water and
Sewerage Board shall have such other collection remedies as are
available to collect other service charges.
(b) Unpaid charges and penalties shall constitute a lien against
the individual significant industrial user's property.
(c) Users desiring to dispute such penalties must file a written
request for the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board to
reconsider the fine along with full payment of the penalty amount within
thirty (30) days of being notified of the penalty. Where the Shelbyville
Power, Water and Sewerage Board believes a request has merit, the
Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board shall convene a hearing
on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request from the
significant industrial user and a hearing will be held before the
Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board in accordance with the
provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-124. The control
authority may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the penalty.
(d) Issuance of an administrative penalty shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(7) Emergency suspensions. The Shelbyville Power, Water and
Sewerage Board may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the
POTW, or the environment.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution of process wastewater to
the POTW. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the control authority may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
building sewer connection to the POTW, to prevent or minimize damage
to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-123
The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the control authority that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection (8) of
this section are initiated against the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit to the control
authority a detailed written statement describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence within five days after notification of suspension of service or
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
subsections (3) or (8) of this section.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
(8) Termination of discharge. In addition to the provision in
§ 8-1007(6) of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to permit termination:
(a) Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or
general permit conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 8-1002 of this
chapter.
Such user(s) will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (3) of this section
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
control authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (as added by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1012. Judicial enforcement remedies. (1) Injunctive relief. (a) If any
person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
POTW contrary to the provisions of this ordinance or any order or
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit issued
hereunder, the Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board, through
the board attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the Chancery Court of Bedford County. Any judicial
proceedings and relief shall be in accordance with the provisions of
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-127.
(b) When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provisions of this ordinance, an individual
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-124
wastewater discharge permit or general permit, order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Shelbyville
Power, Water and Sewerage Board, through the board attorney, may
petition the court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction
or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual wastewater discharge or general permit,
order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the
user.
(c) The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board may also
seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(2) Civil penalties. (a) A user who has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit or general permit, an order issued hereunder, or any
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Shelbyville
Power, Water, and Sewerage Board for a maximum civil penalty of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(b) The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board may
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, engineering fees, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
board.
(c) In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited
to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(d) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(3) Criminal prosecution. Any violation of this ordinance is subject to
criminal prosecution as ascertained in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 40-35-3.
(4) Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this
ordinance are not exclusive. The control authority may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Shelbyville
Power, Water and Sewerage Board enforcement response plan. However, the
control authority may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to take
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-125
more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (as added
by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1013. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. (1) Treatment
upset. (a) Any significant industrial user which experiences an upset in
operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is
not the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the control
authority thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the upset.
(b) A user who wishes to establish affirmative defense of a
treatment upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(i) An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset;
(ii) The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(iii) The user has submitted the following information to
the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the upset (where such information is provided orally, a
written report thereof shall be filed by the user within five (5)
days).
The report shall contain:
(A) A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance;
(B) The duration of noncompliance, including exact
dates and times of noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance
is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably
expected to be restored;
(C) All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate
and prevent recurrence of such an upset.
(c) A significant industrial user which complies with the
notification provisions of this section in a timely manner shall have an
affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the Shelbyville
Power, Water and Sewerage Board for any noncompliance with this
ordinance, or an order or industrial wastewater discharge or general
permit issued hereunder to the significant industrial user, which arises
out of violations attributable and alleged to have occurred during the
period of the documented and verified upset.
(d) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-126
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(2) Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in § 8-1002(3)(a) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions
in § 8-1002(3)(b)(i) through (xvi) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
(a) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharge and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
(b) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the control authority was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.
The affirmative defense outlined in this section does not apply to the
specific prohibitions in § 8-1002(3)(b)(i), (iii) and (xv) of this chapter.
(3) Bypass. (a) For the purposes of this section:
(i) Bypass means the intentional diversion of
wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(ii) Severe property damage means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which
causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent
loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b) Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) Bypass notification. (i) If a user knows in advance of the
need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control
authority, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass.
(ii) A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the
control authority within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also
be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration to the bypass, including
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-127
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
(d) Prohibition of a bypass. (i) Bypass is prohibited, and the
control authority may take enforcement action against a user for
a bypass, unless;
(A) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(B) There was no feasible alternative to the
bypass, including the use of auxiliary treatment facilities,
retention of untreated wastes, or maintenances during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is
not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;
and
(C) The user properly notified the control authority
as required by subsection (3)(c) of this section.
The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will
meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(i) of this section. (as added
by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)
8-1014. Miscellaneous provisions. (1) Pretreatment charges and fees.
The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Board may adopt reasonable fees
for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the board's pretreatment
program, which may include:
(a) Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including
the cost of processing such applications;
(b) Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing the user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports and certification statements submitted by
users;
(c) Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
(d) Fees for filing appeals;
(e) Fees to recover administrative and legal costs (not included
in subsection (1)(b)) associated with the enforcement activity taken by the
control authority to address user noncompliance; and
Change 9, June 28, 2011 8-128
(f) Other fees the board may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered by this ordinance and are separate from all other fees, fines, and
penalties chargeable by the board.
(2) Severability. If any provision, paragraph, word, section or article
of this ordinance is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections and chapters shall not be
affected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(3) Conflict. All other ordinances and parts of other ordinances
inconsistent or conflicting with any part of this ordinance are hereby repealed
to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict.
(4) Effective date. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from
and after its passage, approval and publication, as provided by law. (as added
by Ord. #863, Nov. 2008)

interferes with the comfort and well-being of the public, thereby creating a
public nuisance. Such nuisance shall be handled by the city as follows:
(1) Removal required. One or more such motor vehicles in violation of
the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a nuisance detrimental to the
health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. It shall be the
duty of the registered owner of such motor vehicle and shall also be the duty of
the person in charge or control of the private property upon which motor vehicle
is located, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or otherwise, to remove
the same or to have the vehicle housed within a fully enclosed structure.
(2) Notice to remove. Whenever it shall appear that a violation of the
provision of this section exists, the city manager shall give, or cause to be given,
notice to the registered owner of any motor vehicle which is in violation of this
section, and to the owner or person in lawful possession or control of the
property upon which such motor vehicle is located, advising that such motor
vehicle violates the provisions of this section and directing that such vehicle be
moved to a place of lawful storage within ten (10) days. Such notice shall be
served upon the owner of the vehicle by leaving a copy of such notice upon or
within the vehicle. Notice to the owner or person in lawful possession or control
of the property upon which motor vehicle is located may be served by
conspicuously posting such notice upon the premises or by United States mail.
(3) Refusal to remove. Any person who fails, neglects or refuses to
remove the improperly stored or disabled motor vehicle or properly store the
same and abate said nuisance in accordance with the notice as provided herein,
shall be in violation of the provisions of this section.
10-12
(4) Vehicle removal. If the vehicle is not disposed of after the time
provided for in the aforesaid notice, the owner shall be cited for violating this
section. It shall be a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof,
during which any violation of this section is committed, continued, or permitted,
and upon conviction of any such violation such person shall be punishable by a
fine as established by local applicable laws. If the vehicle is not disposed of after
the time provided for in the aforesaid notice and after having been properly
adjudicated in violation of this section, the city manager may report the location
of such vehicle to the police department and direct its removal. The police
department or a wrecker designated by it shall then remove such vehicle or
cause it to be removed to a designated storage area. A permanent record shall
be completed on the vehicle containing make, model, I.D., personal contents and
general condition. Vehicle will be removed only during day light hours.
(5) Disposal of vehicle. If after 45 days, the vehicle has not been
claimed, the holder of the vehicle shall make or cause to be made a title search
on the vehicle. After the title search has been completed, the holder of such
vehicle may dispose of such vehicle as prescribed by state law.
(6) Return of vehicle to owner. If during the time that the vehicle is
being held, the owner of the vehicle demands the return of such vehicle, then the
holder shall turn the vehicle over to the owner upon payment of the storage and
tow in fees by the owner. The holder shall notify the city manager of such
redemption by the owner.
(7) Storage and sale of valuable property found in abandoned vehicles.
Any valuable property found in any abandoned vehicle subject to this section
shall be stored by the police department and sold at public auction as
determined by the city manager. (Ord. #520, March 1995, as amended by
Ord. #743, July 2004)

of Lag Field, Shelbyville Municipal Airport, Shelbyville, Tennessee, of record in
the office of the city recorder, is hereby incorporated into this chapter and made
a part hereof.
(1) The established elevation of the airport is 802 feet above mean sea

(2) The airport reference point is established at a location described as
follows: The exact center of the main runway. (1979 code, § 11-1103)
11-304. Zones. In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, airport
approach surface zones, horizontal surface zones, conical surface zones, and
transitional surface zones are hereby established as hereinafter defined and as
shown on the airport zoning map.
(1) Approach surface zone. The approach surface zone is an inclined
plane located directly above the approach area. The dimensions of the approach
area are measured horizontally. The approach areas for each particular runway
are symmetrically located with respect to the extended runway center lines and
have lengths and widths as shown on the airport zoning map, which also shows
the slopes of the respective approach surface zones.
(2) Horizontal surface zone. The horizontal surface zone is a plane,
circular in shape, with its height 150 feet above the established airport elevation
and having a radius from the airport reference point as indicated on the airport
zoning map.
(3) Conical surface zone. The conical surface zone extends upward and
outward from the periphery and outward from the horizontal surface zone with
a slope of 20:1 measured in a vertical plane passing through the airport

with the runway center line. These parallel lines are at a horizontal distance
from the runway center line equal to one-half of the minimum width of each
approach area as shown on the airport zoning map. (1979 code, § 11-1104)
11-305. Height limits. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no
structure, or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained so as
to penetrate the plane which composes the airport approach surface zone,
horizontal surface zone conical surface zone or transitional surface zone, by
being of a height in excess of the height limits herein established for such zone.
For purposes of this regulation, height limits shown on the airport zoning map
are hereby established for each of the zones in question. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the height limits prescribed by
this chapter shall not establish for any particular parcel of land at any
particular point within such parcel, a height limit of less than sixty (60) feet
above the surface elevation of the land at that point. (1979 code, § 11-1105)
11-306. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
chapter, no use may be made of land within any airport approach surface zone,
horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone, or transitional surface zone, in
such manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish
between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endanger the
landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft. Except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, it shall be unlawful to put on land located within an airport
approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone, or

and any governmental office or building, the facilities of which
involves the concentration of people. (1979 code, § 11-1106)
11-307. Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase
the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property,
not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply for
a variance therefrom. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application
of enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this
chapter. (1979 code, § 11-1107)
11-7
11-308. Permits. (1) Future uses. No material change shall be made in
the use of land, and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or
otherwise established in any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface
zone, conical surface zone, or transitional surface zone, unless a permit therefor
shall have been applied for and granted. Each such application shall indicate
the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted.
(2) Existing uses. Before any existing use, structure, or tree may
replaced, substantially altered, or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or
replanted within any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone,
conical surface zone, or transitional surface zone which would violate any of the
within set forth provisions a permit must be secured authorizing such
replacement, change, or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would
allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a
non-conforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become
a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these
provisions or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as
indicated, all applications for a permit for the replacement, change, or repair of
any existing use, structure, or tree shall be granted. (1979 code, § 11-1108)
11-309. Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
under section 11-307 or 11-308 may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purposes of this chapter and reasonable in the circumstances, be
so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
permit the Shelbyville Airport Commission, at its own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to
indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. (1979 code, § 11-1109)

prohibit the normal and ordinary domestic and/or farm use of electrical tools,
appliances, or lighting in the various zones hereinbefore designated. It is
further provided that existing uses, structures, or trees in existence on the date
of the passage of these provisions and constituting violations of same at that
time, are excepted provisions hereof; but this exception does not apply to
existing trees which may hereinafter become a violation. (1979 code, § 11-1110)
11-311. Appeals. (1) Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by
any decision of the City of Shelbyville made in the administration of this

enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

appealed from, unless the chief enforcement officer certifies to the board, after
the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in
the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by order
of the board on notice to the chief enforcement officer and on due cause shown.
(4) The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give public notice, and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.

(1) Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Tennessee
has in Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 13-7-201 through 13-7-210, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore,
the City of Shelbyville, Tennessee, Mayor and City Council do ordain as follows:
(2) Findings of fact. (a) The City of Shelbyville, Tennessee, Mayor and
its legislative body wishes to establish eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the NFIP
regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
ch. l, section 60.3.
(b) Areas of the City of Shelbyville, Tennessee are subject to
periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(c) Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or
construction which is inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-11
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.
(4) Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are:
(a) To protect human life, health, safety and property;
(b) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(d) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in flood prone areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize blight in
flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a flood prone area;
(h) To establish eligibility for participation in the NFIP. (as
replaced by Ord. #2014-932, Jan. 2014)

entire structure shall meet the standards for new construction;
(n) When proposed new construction and substantial
improvements are located in multiple flood hazard risk zones or in a flood
hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the entire structure
shall meet the standards for the most hazardous flood hazard risk zone
and the highest base flood elevation.
(2) Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following provisions, in addition to those set forth in § 11-405(1) are required:
(a) Residential Structures. In AE Zones where base flood
elevation data is available, new construction and substantial
improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one
foot (1') above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate
equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of this section:
"Enclosures."
Within approximate A Zones where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade (as
defined in § 11-402). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood
hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in
accordance with the standards of this section: "Enclosures."
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-24
(b) Non-residential structures. In AE Zones, where base flood
elevation data is available, new construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated or flood proofed

standards of this section: "Enclosures."
In approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not been
established and where alternative data is not available, new construction
and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
non-residential building, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated or flood proofed to no lower than three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (as defined in § 11-402). Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate
equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of this section:
"Enclosures."
Non-residential buildings located in all A Zones may be flood
proofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the building
below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and are built with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such
certification to the administrator as set forth in § 11-404(2).
(c) Enclosures. All new construction and substantial
improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding,
shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow
for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(i) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a Tennessee professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
(A) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having
a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the finished grade;
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-25
(C) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(ii) The enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles, storage or building access.
(iii) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
finished or partitioned into separate rooms in such a way as to
impede the movement of floodwaters and all such partitions shall
comply with the provisions of § 11-405(2).
(d) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles. (i) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially
improved, on:
(A) Individual lots or parcels;
(B) In expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions; or
(C) In new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all
the requirements of new construction.
(ii) All manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that either:
(A) In AE Zones, with base flood elevations, the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a
permanent foundation to no lower than one foot (1') above
the level of the base flood elevation; or
(B) In approximate A Zones, without base flood
elevations, the manufactured home chassis is elevated and
supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements
of at least equivalent strength) that are at least three feet
(3') in height above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in
§ 11-402).
(iii) Any manufactured home, which has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must meet the
standards of § 11-405(1) and (2).
(iv) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
(v) All recreational vehicles placed in an identified
special flood hazard area must either:
(A) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days;
(B) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed,
on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-26
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached structures or additions); or
(C) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction.
(e) Standards for subdivision and other proposed new
development proposals. Subdivisions and other proposed new
developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to
determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(i) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
(ii) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(iii) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
(iv) In all approximate A Zones require that all new
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater
than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, include
within such proposals base flood elevation (see § 11-405(5)).
(3) Standards for special flood hazard areas with established base flood
elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the special flood
hazard areas established in § 11-403(2), are areas designated as floodways. A
floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters,
debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of
encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall
apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface
elevation of the base flood elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during
the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the
community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide
supporting technical data, using the same methodologies as in the
effective Flood Insurance Study for the City of Shelbyville, Tennessee and
certification, thereof.
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-27
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 11-405(1) and (2).
(4) Standards for areas of special flood hazard Zones AE with
established base flood elevation but without floodways designated. Located
within the special flood hazard areas established in § 11-403(2), where streams
exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new construction
and substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special
flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 11-405(1) and (2).
(5) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations
and floodways (A Zones). Located within the special flood hazard areas
established in § 11-403(2), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been
provided and where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
shall apply:
(a) The administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from any
federal, state, or other sources, including data developed as a result of
these regulations (see (b) below), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development in
approximate A Zones meet the requirements of § 11-405(1) and (2).
(b) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home
parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation
data.
(c) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or flood
proofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent
grade (as defined in § 11-402). All applicable data including elevations or
flood proofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 11-404(2).
Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-28
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of § 11-405(2).
(d) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet (20') whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank,
unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the City of Shelbyville,
Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(e) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 11-405(1) and (2). Within approximate A Zones,
require that those subsections of § 11-405(2) dealing with the alteration
or relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities
are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as
required.
(6) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 11-403(2), are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1' to 3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition
to those set forth in § 11-405(1) and (2) apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above as many feet
as the depth number specified on the FIRM's, in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three feet
(3') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of § 11-405(2).
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential buildings may be flood proofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
flood proofed and designed watertight to be completely flood proofed to at
least one foot (1') above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-29
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be flood proofed to at least
three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required
in accordance with § 11-404(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(7) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 11-403(2), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 11-404 and 11-405 shall apply.
(8) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the City of
Shelbyville, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood
hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the
following provisions shall apply:
(a) No encroachments including fill material or other
development including structures shall be located within an area of at
least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of
each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing
and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
locality.
(b) When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation
and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with
§§ 11-404 and 11-405. (as added by Ord. #2014-932, Jan. 2014)
11-406. Variance procedures. (1) Municipal board of zoning appeals.
(a) Authority. The City of Shelbyville, Tennessee Municipal
Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
(b) Procedure. Meetings of the municipal board of zoning
appeals shall be held at such times, as the board shall determine. All
meetings of the municipal board of zoning appeals shall be open to the

municipal board of zoning appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the
grounds thereof. In all cases where an appeal is made by a property
owner or other interested party, a fee of (amount) dollars for the cost of
publishing a notice of such hearings shall be paid by the appellant. The
administrator shall transmit to the municipal board of zoning appeals all
papers constituting the record upon which the appeal action was taken.
The municipal board of zoning appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to
parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time which
shall not be more than (number of) days from the date of the hearing. At
the hearing, any person or party may appear and be heard in person or
by agent or by attorney.
(d) Powers. The municipal board of zoning appeals shall have
the following powers:
(i) Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged by the applicant that there is error in any order,
requirement, permit, decision, determination, or refusal made by
the administrator or other administrative official in carrying out
or enforcement of any provisions of this ordinance.
(ii) Variance procedures. In the case of a request for a
variance the following shall apply:
(A) The City of Shelbyville, Tennessee Municipal
Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this
ordinance.
(B) Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures as defined herein, upon
a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary deviation from the requirements of this ordinance
to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(C) In passing upon such applications, the
municipal board of zoning appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this ordinance; and
(1) The danger that materials may be swept
onto other property to the injury of others;
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-31
(2) The danger to life and property due to
flooding or erosion;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed
facility and its contents to flood damage;
(4) The importance of the services provided
by the proposed facility to the community;
(5) The necessity of the facility to a
waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent use;
(6) The availability of alternative locations,
not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
(8) The safety of access to the property in
times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration,

and the purposes of this ordinance, the municipal board of
zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this ordinance.
(E) Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard and the factors listed in § 11-406(1).
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
Change 11, April 9, 2015 11-32
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance (as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred
dollars ($100.00)) coverage, and that such construction below the base
flood elevation increases risks to life and property.
(d) The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request. (as added by
Ord. #2014-932, Jan. 2014)
11-407. Legal status provisions. (1) Conflict with other ordinances. In
case of conflict between this ordinance or any part thereof, and the whole or part
of any existing or future ordinance of the City of Shelbyville, Tennessee, the
most restrictive shall in all cases apply.

maintenance of said system, guarding trenches and excavations while said
system is being installed or subsequent extensions, repairs or alterations are

to defend the same. (1979 code, § 13-210)
13-5
13-211. Regulation. The city and the company hereby agree that this
ordinance shall, from time to time, be subject to rules and regulations adopted
by the company and approved by the Tennessee Public Service Commission or
any other regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof during the term of this
franchise, and shall also be subject to all rules and regulations adopted and
approved by the Tennessee Public Service Commission itself; and that all such
rules and regulations shall be and become part of this ordinance to the same
extent and with the same effect as if said rules and regulations were herein set

relating thereto adopted or approved by the Tennessee Public Service
Commission. (1979 code, § 13-211)

whatsoever. (1979 code, § 13-212)

accepting the terms of this franchise, and agreeing to perform all the conditions
thereof. (1979 code, § 13-213)
13-214. Franchise fee, term, renegotiation. The company shall continue
to pay the inspection fee currently paid to the city under its prior franchises. In
addition, the company shall pay an initial franchise fee in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000). No franchise fee based on gross receipts shall be
initially payable during the term of this franchise. However, the city reserves
the option to reopen this section at the times set out below so as to provide for
a franchise fee based on gross receipts from the sale of gas through the
company's distribution system within the City of Shelbyville, or within its
Shelbyville system within Bedford County should Tennessee law be changed to
permit same. Said franchise fee, if negotiated in the future, shall become due
and payable each year ninety (90) days from the end of the company's fiscal
year, so long as the company shall supply and sell natural gas to the public
within said city, or so long as this franchise is in effect. Any said franchise fee
shall be treated and recovered as required by Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 65-4-105, as it exists at the time of such renegotiation. in the event such a
13-6
franchise fee is negotiated, the city shall have access at all reasonable times to
the appropriate books of the company for the purpose of ascertaining the amount
due to the city, and the company shall furnish to the city an annual report
showing the amount of its sales within its Shelbyville system.
This system may be reopened for the sole purpose of negotiating or
renegotiating a franchise fee, on the following dates:
(1) 26th day of March, 1991 (five (5) years after the effective date of
the franchise).
(2) 26th day of March, 1996 (ten (10) years after the effective date of
the franchise).
(3) 26th day of March, 2001 (fifteen (15) years after the effective date
of the franchise) .
(4) 26th day of March, 2006 (twenty (20) years after the effective date
of the franchise).
In addition to the dates set out above, this section may be reopened in the
event of a change in that portion of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 65-4-105, or
any other provision of law that deals with the treatment and recovery of
franchise fees, or in the event of any change in the governmental structure of
the city and Bedford County.
In the event the city or the company shall desire a negotiation or revision
of any franchise fee on any of the dates set out herein, it shall notify the other
party in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the appropriate reopening date.
Said franchise fee may be initiated, increased, decreased, or otherwise modified,
but if no change is agreed upon, the fee than in effect shall continue in effect.
Any fee agreed upon by the parties shall become effective on the first day
of the month following said revision date and shall continue to be in full force
and effect to the termination date of this franchise, unless same shall be further
revised at a subsequent date as provided herein. Upon the revised franchise fee
becoming effective in accordance with the provisions of this section, the fee in
existence at that time shall be cancelled.
It is understood between the parties that the company's base rates
(charges over and above purchased gas costs paid to the Company's pipeline
suppliers) are uniform throughout the State of Tennessee. So long as no
franchise fee is imposed hereunder, the company's base rates, plus taxes, in
Shelbyville will be its lowest such rates within the State of Tennessee. (1979
code, § 13-214)
13-215. Severability . If any section or portion of any section of this
ordinance shall hereafter be declared or determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the company, at its election (to be given to the city by
notice in writing within thirty (30) days after any such declaration or
determination) may ratify or confirm the remaining portions of this ordinance
and upon such ratification or confirmation the remaining portions of this
ordinance shall remain in full force and effect. (1979 code, § 13-215)
13-7
13-216. Acceptance by company. The company shall, within thirty (30)
days after the passage of this ordinance, file with the City Recorder of the City
of Shelbyville its unconditional acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
ordinance signed by its president and, after the filing of such acceptance, this
ordinance shall constitute a contract between the parties hereto and shall
(subject to the rights and powers vested in and orders lawfully issued by the
Tennessee Public Service Commission or such other regulatory body of the State
of Tennessee as may hereafter succeed to the rights and powers of the Tennessee
Public Service Commission) be the measure of the rights, powers, obligations,
privileges and liabilities of the city and of the company. (1979 code, § 13-216)
13-217. Successors. All the privileges given and obligations created by
this ordinance shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the company.

Updated August 2016
2. If a portion of the tract is underlain by more than one natural feature subject to a deduction from the total tract acreage, that acreage shall be subject to the most restrictive deduction only.
3. Since acreage that is contained within the public or private rights of way, access easements or access strips are excluded from developable lot area, any portion of these items that also contains a natural feature subject to a deduction from the total tract acreage should not be deducted when calculating the adjusted tract acreage.
4. The net Adjusted Tract Acreage resulting from the calculations below shall be divided by the density factor specified for the base zoning district in Table 4.125(A) to determine the total residential density.
5. The maximum density may be calculated by multiplying the Adjusted Tract Acreage by the number of dwelling units per adjusted tract acre permitted within the zone district(s) requested in the development plan.

The non-residential non-conforming use of a building designed and constructed for nonresidential activities which were permitted prior to the change in zoning may be expanded or changed to another nonconforming use upon a determination by the board of zoning appeals that the new nonconforming use will be more compatible with surrounding land uses than the existing nonconforming use and the land is owned or otherwise controlled by the business owner so the existing business is not expanded through the acquisition of additional land.

However, the new structure shall comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be no larger than 125 percent of the original structures floor area. If the use is residential and is not rebuilt within twelve (12) months, then the use shall not be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any purpose except for reasonable cause as determined by the Planning Director. If this use is industrial or commercial and is not rebuilt within thirty (30) months, then the use shall not be restored, or reoccupied for any purpose except for reasonable cause as determined by the Planning Director. Non-conforming structures must be rebuilt in accordance with the regulations of this ordinance. No reconstruction of damaged or destroyed facilities utilized by a nonconforming use shall increase the extent of any infringement upon any open space required by this ordinance. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to the reconstruction of all buildings and structures associated with any non-conforming use located in a Floodway District. Reconstruction of all buildings and structures shall be in accordance with the City of Shelbyvilles Municipal Floodplain Regulations.

ARTICLE VII
BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
SECTION
7.1 Purpose
7.2 Authority
7.3 Variances
7.4 Special Exceptions
7.5 Specific Requirements for Special Exceptions
7.1 PURPOSE: The Board of Zoning Appeals is a quasi-judicial body responsible for hearing appeals from individuals who are requesting exceptions or variations for City Ordinances in regard to land use requirements or from individuals who are questioning the appropriateness of orders made by City officials. It is the Boards goal to treat all individuals fairly and courteously.
7.2 AUTHORITY: The state enabling statutes as cited in Section 13-7-207 of the Tennessee Code Annotated limit the responsibilities of Boards of Zoning Appeals. A listing of these responsibilities in conjunction with a brief narrative thereof is as follows:
A. Administrative Review: The first enumerated power is to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement, permit, decision, or refusal made by a City Official in the carrying out or enforcement of any provision of the zoning ordinance. This power concerns the Boards authority to review the actions of the building official in relation to the specifics of the zoning ordinance. In all cases falling under this power, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove that the administrative official actions are not in conformance with the provisions within the zoning text.
B. Special Exceptions: The second specified power within the Tennessee Code Annotated is to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, requests for special exceptions or for interpretation of the zoning map. Each zoning district allows certain uses, and excludes others. Generally, these uses fall into one of two categories: uses by right and uses on appeal. A use by right was discussed earlier. Uses on appeal, also known as special exceptions, are a category intended to provide flexibility in an effort to cope with situations where a particular
Shelbyville Municipal Zoning Ordinance Article 7, Page 2
Effective April 15, 2015
Last Updated August 2016
use or class of uses, although not inherently inconsistent with the intent and purpose of a particular zone, could create special problems or hazards if allowed to develop and locate as a matter of right.
C. Variances: The purpose of variances is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of this ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land. The variances shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle which is preventing an owner from using their property under this ordinance. Each appeal is heard and decided on its own merit. Be advised that the Board of Zoning Appeals may be limited in their authority, if any, to grant a variance from the Zoning Ordinance.
7.3 VARIANCES.
A. STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES: The Board shall not grant a variance unless it makes findings based upon evidence presented to it as follows:
1. The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographic conditions of the specific property involved that would result in a particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict application of this ordinance were carried out.
2. The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same district.
3. The variance will not authorize activities in a zone district other than those permitted by this ordinance.
4. Financial returns only shall not be considered as a basis for granting a variance.
5. The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person having an interest in the property after the effective date of this ordinance.
6. That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
7. The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
8. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the property is located.
9. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of
Shelbyville Municipal Zoning Ordinance Article 7, Page 3
Effective April 15, 2015
Last Updated August 2016
