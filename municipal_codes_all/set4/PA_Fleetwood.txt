TABLE OF CONTENTS
Tools for Finding Information: In addition to the municipality's legislation, this publication
contains tools to help locate information: table of contents, index, chapter outlines (schemes),
and a disposition list.
Chapters: Chapters are generally discrete pieces of legislation but can also be made up of
several individual pieces on a related topic. In that case, the individual pieces are arranged into
articles or parts within the chapter.
Reserved Chapters: In the numbering of chapters, space has been provided for the convenient
insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments.
Section Numbering: A chapter related section numbering system is employed. Each section of
every item of legislation is assigned a number, which indicates both the number of the chapter
in which the item of legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter.
Thus, the fourth section of Chapter 6 is § 6-4.
Scheme: The scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter. These titles
are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the
content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For
ease and precision of reference, the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.
Page Numbers: A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms
an autonomous unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a
colon and the numeral "1." Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 6:1. By the use of this system, it is
possible to add or to change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the
sequence of subsequent pages.

d) Revisions. The boundaries of the Architectural Overlay District as delineated herein shall not be changed (expanded or decreased) without the review and approval of Borough Council, and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code and other applicable law.
25
Article 406.3 - Conflict with Other Code Sections
The definitions and regulations set forth in this Article shall apply solely to the Architectural Overlay District. Wherever there is a conflict or inconsistency between the Architectural Overlay District regulations and other definitions of the Zoning Ordinance, those regulations set forth in this Article shall govern the development and redevelopment within the Architectural Overlay District.
Article 406.4 - Design Criteria
a) Materials
1) Exterior Painting, Metals and Masonry
All buildings within the Architectural Overlay District should be restored to the original architectural period if appropriate. Modifications which use color, details and architectural motifs from other eras should be avoided. Cosmetic face-lifts which cover and/or obliterate the original architectural character of a façade should be avoided.
The original materials used for wall facings and ornamentation such as brick, sheet metal, cast iron and the colors themselves, give buildings special character and identity. The materials actually provide visual harmony to the entire streetscape and downtown atmosphere. Covering original material and details of just one building with inappropriate substitutes like aluminum or vinyl siding and stucco destroys the architectural character and identity of the entire commercial district. Repair and proper maintenance of original exterior surfaces and decorative features is the best solution to the problem of a deteriorating façade. By taking advantage of the quality of the original materials and design, the life of a building will be indefinitely prolonged and its commercial value increased.
A) Brickwork / Masonry
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
i) When cleaning or removing paint from buildings that are made of brick or masonry, use steam or low pressure water (no more than 300psi).
ii) Never sandblast or use abrasives on brick. Brick is one of the least costly materials to maintain.
iii) To preserve its original beauty and prolong its life, only periodic cleaning and repointing are required.
Repoint brick and masonry facades when required. Repointing is the process of removing deteriorated mortar from the joints of a wall and replacing it with new mortar. Repointing is required when weather and the elements have worn away the mortar or when the mortar is so old that it begins to break apart and crumble from between the building blocks. Properly done, repointing restores the visual and physical integrity of brick and masonry. When repointing, match new mortar to the original compressive strength, color, composition, depth, and finishing of the original joints. Failure to match mortar may be harmful to the composition of the building.
26
If brick is already painted, it may be cleaned with a chemical paint remover, but a test should be performed to prevent brick damage. Brick used in some older buildings was fired from inferior clay and was meant to be protected. In this case, match the original paint color that was used to protect the surface; otherwise, painting brick is not recommended or encouraged.
Repair decorative brickwork and masonry whenever possible. Only replace decorative masonry features when they are completely missing or too deteriorated to repair. Use existing physical evidence to guide the new work and match the original features as closely as possible.
B) Wood
The Architectural Overly District encourages and recommends the following:
i) All wood structures and wood trim should be prepared for painting by manually scraping old paint to reveal the original architectural details.
ii) Wood should not be cleaned by sandblasting or by using pressurized water or steam.
iii) In areas where wood is beyond repair, appropriate carpentry is available. Professional milling of architectural elements or composite reproductions are available.
iv) Wood details should not be covered over with cladding which hides the original milled wood work.
C) Metals
1) Sheet Metal
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
i) Clean all sheet metal using chemical paint remover.
ii) Never sandblast or use abrasives on sheet metal.
iii) Repair or replace damaged areas with sections duplicated by a commercial sheet metal shop.
iv) Automobile fiberglass compounds can be used to fill and patch small voids and dented areas.
v) Properly prime and paint sheet metal with oil-based paint to prevent rusting.
2) Cast Iron
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
i) Use wire brushes and steel wool to remove loose or deteriorating paint and rust. Chemical paint removers should not be used on cast iron.
27
ii) Heat or low pressure sandblasting may be used to remove paint from cast iron.
iii) Missing cast iron parts can be recast in aluminum, fiberglass or reinforced gypsum polymer cements.
iv) Properly prime and paint cast iron with rust inhibitive paint made for use on exterior metal surfaces.
v) A powder coating may be applied to entire architectural pieces for longer term rust prevention.
D) Painting and Color Palettes
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
i) White paint is a reversible treatment, paint color(s) should nonetheless be chosen from those colors which are appropriate to the period of the building and should be applied to architectural features in a period appropriate fashion.
ii) The placement and quantity of accent colors and the relationship of lights to darks should be in keeping with the character of the building.
iii) Use historically accurate color palettes. Local paint suppliers or the Architectural Overlay District resource library can help you select colors from the historical collections.
iv) For most of Fleetwoods buildings, use colors from the period between 1880 and 1930.
Avoid large areas of stark, bright white, as such color is often not historically accurate and shows dirt faster than most colors. In many cases, the original colors used on any building can be determined with minimum effort. In the process of scraping old paint, one should be able to uncover the original coat of paint and match it to samples provided by local paint suppliers. However, discretion is allowed depending on choices made by original owners.
E) Stucco
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
i) Repair stucco façades by removing only the damaged material and patching with new stucco.
ii) Duplicate the strength, composition, color and texture of the original stucco surface.
28
Article 406.5 Architectural Elements and Details
This section outlines the uses and appropriateness of architectural designs and features that give personality to existing and new buildings and outdoor spaces.
a) Windows and Doors
1) Store Front Entrance Ways
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) The design of entrance ways and the street-level portion of façades should be compatible with the design of upper floors to retain the overall character of a building.
B) Retail stores, service-oriented businesses and restaurants should have large panes, proportioned display windows on the ground level.
C) Buildings with multiple storefronts should be visually unified through the use of building materials, colors, architectural details, awnings, signage and lighting. It is encouraged to work with attached property owners to create unity.
D) The original proportions of windows and any special features such as transoms or leaded glass should be retained.
E) Entrances should be well defined by architectural elements such as lintels, pediments, pilasters, columns, porticos, porches, railings, balustrades, etc.
F) Avoid replacing an entire building front when repairing existing materials and surfaces or replacing parts or sections may be all that is necessary.
2) Windows and Shutters
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Repair of windows, original to the structure, is recommended as a priority to business/property owners.
B) New windows should be compatible with the style, size, finish, color and detail of windows on the existing building
C) Whenever possible, windows on upper floors should align vertically with windows and entrances on the first floor.
D) The rhythm of windows and façade openings and decorative window trim should be consistent with that of the original building.
E) New windows should match the original ones in size, material and style.
F) When appropriate to the design of a building, shutters should be provided on all windows.
29
G) Proper hardware should be used for the installation of shutters.
H) Air conditioning vents are discouraged in all windows facing streets.
b) Site and Building Enhancements
The design and use of sidewalks, fences, landscaped areas and lamp posts can dramatically affect the attractiveness of the Architectural Overlay District to potential shoppers. Conversely, if poorly designed or not used at all, these elements can detract from the publics experience of a downtown area and leave negative impressions. Well-designed and implemented site and building enhancements add value to properties.
1) Paving and Sitescaping
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Quality paving materials should be used on sidewalks, pedestrian walkways, pathways, plazas and courtyards. The materials should be appropriate for the proposed pedestrian function and circulation requirements of such areas.
B) The materials and design should enhance the overall site and be consistent with the building itself.
C) Avoid using asphalt for pedestrian walk or pathways.
D) All areas of a site not occupied by buildings, parking facilities or other improvements should be landscaped with trees, shrubs, hedges, perennial gardens or ground cover.
E) Plantings should be designed in a manner that is complimentary to the surrounding property and buildings.
F) Tree guidelines, both selection of trees and planting, are on file in the Fleetwood Borough office and are incorporated herein by reference.
2) Walls and Fences
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Walls and fences should match the architecture and style of the building(s) on the property.
B) The materials used and color of walls and fences should be consistent.
C) Avoid the use of highway-style guard rails and stockade or contemporary security fencing such as chain link fences and barbed or razor wire.
D) Garden walls and appropriate fencing styles should continue through the building line along sidewalks.
3) Exterior Lighting
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
30
A) When selecting lighting fixtures, use minimum wattage metal halide or high pressure sodium light sources. Low pressure sodium and mercury vapor light sources are discouraged.
B) Select decorative lamp posts that conform to downtown Fleetwoods lighting standards. Their design should be appropriate to the overall character of the downtown district.
C) Lamp posts are especially recommended along façade sidewalks, near gateways and side entrance corridors.
D) Parking area light stands and decorative lamp posts should not exceed twelve (12) feet in overall height.
c) Signs and Awnings
Signs are as important today as they were long ago. Signs have a dramatic impact on the overall image of the Borough. The effect of signage on passersby, whether they are current or potential customers, can leave a great impression.
Signs and awnings that are simple, suitably sized, attractively designed, constructed of appropriate materials and properly located will favorably enhance the image of a business and the overall downtown.
1) Sign Types
The following are recommended sign types with definitions.
A) Flush Signs are generally meant to be viewed from a distance. These signs are visible when one is directly facing a structures facade or from across the street. Ideally, flush signs should be placed on vacant panels above doors and display windows.
B) Projecting Signs are primarily meant to attract the attention of pedestrians because they hang over the sidewalk. Projecting signs are most effective when used on buildings which abut a sidewalk.
C) Freestanding Signs are appropriate when a structure is set back ten or more feet from the sidewalk. Freestanding signs alert people that a business exists when the structure may be partially hidden from pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
D) Window Signs are applied on the inside of display windows or doors. Generally, the viewer would need to be relatively close to the sign for legibility, but that depends on the overall size of the window.
2) Sign Basics
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Use display windows for creative signage.
B) Locate signs and awnings in such a way that avoids completely covering or overwhelming architectural details such as cornices, trim, windows, decorative brickwork or other unique architectural features.
C) The orientation of signs should be geared to sidewalk pedestrians and to vehicular traffic.
31
D) Signs should not be so detailed as to be unreadable by vehicular traffic.
E) Avoid extraneous information on signs and scale them to attract the attention of vehicular traffic.
F) Limit the quantity of signs on storefront display windows and doors. Signs should be sized and scaled to balance, not hide or overwhelm the structure.
G) Neon, internally lit plastic signs, or flashing lights are not recommended as they do not reflect the historic character of the Borough. (Unless the sign comes from the original period, as such, is original to the business.)
H) The size of signs must conform to the Borough Building Codes. Call the Boroughs Code Enforcement Officer for this information.
3) Sign Construction and Design
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Return to or re-create period signage.
B) Utilize lettering fashionable to the period of the building. This type of sign should become the main source of identification.
C) Sign materials and design should reflect the period of the building and the original design of the storefront. Additionally, the colors of signs and awnings should compliment the overall color scheme of the buildings facade and the downtown streetscape.
D) Use artisan-crafted signs and quality sign materials manufactured specifically by the sign industry.
E) Use graphic elements and details of the building and architectural motifs as part of the sign design when feasible.
F) Lettering should be kept to a minimum, and likewise, the message should be brief and to the point. A logo, shape and/or illustration can be submitted or included to communicate the nature of the business.
G) Avoid using multiple signs when one sign will be sufficient, thereby avoiding confusion and distraction. However, the following additional signs may be appropriate in a given situation:
i) Small secondary signs used for directional purposes are acceptable so long as they maintain the same design elements of the main identification sign.
ii) Freestanding sandwich signs that advertise daily specials or events are acceptable so long as they maintain the same design elements of the main identification sign.
4) Lighting Signs
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
32
A) Use external lighting fixtures rather than internally lit plastic fixtures.
B) Avoid using flashing lights of any kind.
C) Sign lighting should be directed to the sign itself and not used to light the surrounding area. Separate fixtures should be used for area lighting.
D) Lighting fixture designs, if visible, should be consistent across the facade and compliment the architectural period of the building.
E) Neon signs are not a good substitute for well-lit, well-designed signs that reflect the Boroughs historical character.
5) Awnings
Awnings are both functional and decorative. They provide sun and climate (thus added energy savings) control for merchandise in display windows and shelter for pedestrian shoppers. An added feature of awnings is that they bring the tremendous appeal of color and pattern, not only to individual buildings, but to the entire downtown streetscape. Both fixed position and retractable awnings are acceptable.
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
A) Utilize awnings fashionable to the period of the building. Slope-type awnings are appropriate as opposed to a waterfall-type awning.
B) Awnings may display the name and nature of the business on the front face and/or side facings. Use simple letter designs and keep the message brief.
C) Awnings may be used on street level and upper stories as long as they are appropriate to and maintain the architectural style of the facade.
D) Select weather-treated canvas or natural looking material when shopping for awnings. Metal and plastic awnings are not recommended.
E) Awnings should not be oversized and should fit within the storefront area and not cover architectural elements.
d) New Construction
New construction should conform to the architectural style(s), scale and character of the existing surrounding properties and shall incorporate the objectives of these Design Guidelines.
1) Demolition
Demolition of existing structures should only be considered under the following conditions:
A) If the building is beyond repair.
B) If the building is not a significant structure or has lost all integrity of its historic character.
33
C) If over 50% of the structure has been destroyed by fire or disaster.
D) If the structure is an unsound threat to public health that cannot be corrected or stabilized in a reasonable time frame.
Article 406.6  Architectural Design
This section outlines the uses and appropriateness of architectural designs and features that give existing and new buildings and outdoor spaces their personality.
a) Orientation of New Buildings
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
1) New buildings should face a street or other public space. Buildings should not front directly onto parking lots.
2) New buildings situated on street corners should have two façades. Both walls do not need to provide their own entrance, but the facade without a door should not be a blank canvas. Rather, it should be an extension of the facade with the entranceits design should be integrated with the main wall of the building.
3) Off street parking areas should be sensitively located to the side or rear of the building. This layout will reduce the visual impact to and disruption of the streetscapes continuity.
b) Scale and Mass of Additions and New Buildings
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
1) The overall scale, massing and proportions of new additions, buildings and new landscape should relate to and be compatible with those of adjacent and surrounding buildings. Changes in scale and mass, such as offsetting a wall(s), or deviating from the existing roof line should be made in graduated increments.
2) Buildings should not have long, uninterrupted flat walls.
3) Designing wall offsets, adding changes in floor levels, including windows and ornamentation to exterior walls should be used to add interest and variety.
4) Roof line offsets, gables and dormers should be utilized to vary the massing of the roofs of buildings.
5) Visibly exposed features of new additions and buildings should be defined with a base and cap or cornice.
c) Materials and Details of Additions and New Buildings
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
1) All materials, details and colors used with new additions should be compatible with the overall design of the original building, as well as with surrounding buildings.
34
2) New additions and buildings should be well integrated with existing structures.
3) Architectural features and motifs of the original building should be retained and repeated in the design of new additions whenever possible.
4) When designing buildings, the patterns, colors, details and prominence of materials used in adjacent building should be taken into account.
5) Aluminum and vinyl siding and trim materials are not recommended.
d) Roofs and Walls of Additions and New Buildings
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
1) The new roof form (its shape) should be appropriate to imitate the existing buildings roof profiles.
2) In new additions, the use of gables, dormers, masonry chimneys, cupolas and similar elements is encouraged where appropriate to the design of the existing building
3) Flat roofs should be avoided on one and two story buildings.
4) The facade of a building should be emphasized through window patterns and proportions and the enhanced treatment of entrances through details, materials and architectural motifs.
5) The design of visible side and rear walls should be compatible with the facade. The use of blank, windowless walls is discouraged. However, if they are absolutely necessary, they should utilize surface articulation and architectural elements found in other wall facings.
e) Service Areas and Mechanical Equipment
The Architectural Overlay District encourages and recommends the following:
1) Loading areas, waste facilities, air conditioning units, exhaust and vent stacks, elevator penthouses and antennae should be located to the rear of buildings or screened from view.
2) The use of interior refuse rooms in lieu of outdoor dumpsters or other methods of waste removal is encouraged. Exterior refuse containers and dumpsters should be screened from view.
3) Fire escapes should not be visible when viewing the façade.

The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following powers:
802.1 APPEALS FROM THE ZONING OFFICER: INTERPRETATION AND REVIEW

requirement, decision or determination, including any order requiring an alleged
violation to stop, cease and desist, made by the Zoning Officer in the
enforcement of this Ordinance.
b) To interpret the provisions of this Ordinance, with the advice of the Solicitor
of the Governing Body and the Planning Committee, where there is doubt as to
its meaning or application. To determine the exact location of a district

determinations.
c) Any other matter relating to this Ordinance when an appellant seeks a review of
any decision, order, or ruling made by the Zoning Officer.

802.2 CHALLENGES TO THE VALIDITY OF ZONING ORDINANCE OR MAP  The
Board may hear all challenges to the validity of the ordinance and map except as indicated in Section 1003 and Subsection (1)(b) of Section 1004 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Codes, as amended. In all such challenges the Board shall take evidence and make record thereon as provided for in this Ordinance or the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions and shall make findings or all relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the court.
802.3 VARIANCE  To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance(s) from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in particular difficulty or unnecessary hardship. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this Ordinance. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
a) That there are unique physical circumstances including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size, of shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not
92
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
c) That said special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from any act
of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance, whether in
violation of the provisions hereof or not, and that such circumstances or
conditions are such that strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land, structure, or
building.
d) That for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, the granting of the
variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or buildings and that
the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
e) That the granting of the variance under such conditions as the Board may deem
necessary or desirable, will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood district in which the property is located.
f) That any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that
the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special
privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity
and district in which the subject property is situated, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property.
g) That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structure,
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the granting of a
variance.
h) That in no case shall a variance be granted solely for reasons of additional financial gain on the part of the applicant.
i) That the jurisdiction of the Governing Body shall not be infringed upon by action
of the Board in any matter which should appropriately be the subject for an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map. No variance shall be
granted under this section to allow a structure or use in a zone restricted
against such structure or use.
802.4 UNIFIED APPEALS  The Board in handling jurisdictional matters outlined in 802.1, 802.2, and 802.3 shall also hear all appeals which an applicant may elect to bring before it with respect to any municipal ordinance or requirement pertaining to the same development plan or
development. In such case the Board shall have no power to pass upon non-zoning issues, but shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided in Section 908 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
93
Planning Code as amended. The Board shall at the conclusion of the hearings make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the court.
802.5 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS  To hear and decide only such special exceptions to the terms of this Ordinance upon which the board is specifically authorized to pass upon by the terms of this Ordinance.

Use in said district.

safeguards as required by this Ordinance.

safeguards as may be deemed by the Board to be advisable and appropriate.

conservation of property values, nor the health and safety of residents or

to its access streets that vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from such use
