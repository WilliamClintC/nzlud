same motion in the same meeting, nor for more than five minutes at a
time, without the consent of the majority of the Board members
present.

adjournment to another time when the lack of public decorum so
interferes with the orderly conduct of the meeting as to warrant such
action.
A. Citizens desiring to address the Board at its stated meetings may do so
by providing written notice to the Township Manager at least seven
days prior to the day of the meeting, and such registration shall include
the name and address of the participant, group affiliation, if applicable,
and the topic to be addressed, or without such notice if recognized by
the presiding officer.

the Board on any agenda item without written notice. All participants
must be recognized by the presiding officer and must preface their

applicable. The presiding officer may limit the time to five minutes for
each citizen to speak. Such discussion shall occur prior to the vote on
the agenda item.

and, upon recognition and receiving permission to speak, shall confine

subject matter, it shall be proper for the presiding officer to request
that a spokesperson be chosen by the group to address the Board and to
limit the number of persons addressing the Board on the same matter
so as to avoid unnecessary repetition.
E. It shall be the policy of the municipality that participants in public
meetings of the Board shall be citizens or taxpayers of the Township or
their counsel or authorized representatives. Others permitted to

interest in any contemplated action of the Board; anyone representing a
group in the community; any representative of a firm or company
eligible to bid on materials or services solicited by the Township; any
employee of the Township; or the counsel or authorized representative
of the previously described persons.

slanderous or obscene remarks or who becomes boisterous or who
makes threats against any person or against public order and security
while in the Board chamber shall be forthwith barred by the presiding

continue shall be granted by the majority vote of the Board members
present.

The Township Manager and all appointed officials, members of committees,
commissions, boards, councils or offices, before commencing their official
duties, shall take and sign an oath of office to support the Constitution of
the United States and of Pennsylvania and to perform the duties of their
office with fidelity, in such form as shall from time to time be prescribed by

be filed with the Township Manager:
Affirmation of Code of Ethics of Township of Pine
Date:
As a(n) (indicate position) of the Township of Pine, I believe and
affirm:
1. That the proper operation of government requires that officials and
employees be independent and impartial in their judgments and
actions; that government decisions and policies be made in the
proper channels of the government structure; that office or position
not be used for personal gain: and that the citizens have confidence
in the integrity of their government and officials and employees.
2. That the realization of these ends is impaired wherever there
exists, or appears to exist, an actual or potential conflict between
the private interest of a municipal official or employee and the
duties of office; and that the public interest requires ethical
standards with respect to official duties.
3. Therefore, as a(n) of the Township of Pine, I assert my
solemn belief that the primary responsibility for maintaining a high
level of ethics among municipal officials and employees falls upon
those in public service.
4. Consequently, I believe it is my duty to:
(a) Respect the rule of law, the concepts of equal treatment for all,
human dignity and ethical conduct in the performance of my
duties.
(b) Observe and act in accordance with the Code of Ethics adopted
by the Township of Pine.

operators providing service within the Township of said certification

schedule of rates and supporting FCC forms and worksheets for basic
service, installation and equipment. If a cable operator elects to use

operator shall submit such number and form of copies as the Township
Secretary shall determine in the notice.
B. Upon receipt of any rate schedule referenced in Subsection A or of any
rate schedule proposing any change in such rates, the Board of
Supervisors, through its designate, the Township Secretary, shall
schedule, give public notice and give notice to the cable operator of a
period during which the Superintendent will receive written comments
from the public and the cable operator on the reasonableness of the
rates. The Board of Supervisors shall also schedule and preside at a
public hearing for the receipt of oral comments. The Board of

received and present an evaluation thereof to the Board of Supervisors.
The Township Secretary shall present the evaluation within 30 days of

Secretary shall recommend that the Board of Supervisors act to extend
the period established for the review as permitted by the Act and the
FCC's regulations to prevent the proposed rates from becoming
effective by operation of law.
D. If the Board of Supervisors extends the period for the Township's
review of a rate filing pursuant to Subsection C, the period for written
comments and the public hearing may be scheduled by the Board of

provided that such period and hearing shall be held at such time that
the comments received will be available for the Board of Supervisors
consideration in making the evaluation. The close of the comment
period and hearing for the initial rate filing of a cable operator that is
providing service upon the effective date of the Township's certification
by the FCC shall not be scheduled more than 120 days from the
effective date of the certification.
E. The Board of Supervisors may waive the requirements of this section
for promotional rate reductions.

Chapter 19
INVESTMENT POLICY
§ 19-1. Purpose.
The intent of the Investment Policy of the Township of Pine is to define the
parameters within which funds are to be managed. In methods, procedures
and practices, the policy formalizes the framework for the Township's
investment activities that must be exercised to ensure effective and
judicious management of the Township's funds. The guidelines are intended
to be broad enough to allow the Board of Supervisors or their designees to
function properly within the parameters of responsibility and authority, yet
specific enough to adequately safeguard the Township's financial assets.
§ 19-2. Governing authority.
The Investment Policy shall be executed in compliance with the
Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code, the Township of Pine Home
Rule Charter, Pennsylvania Act 72 of 1971 (pertaining to collateralization of
§ 18-1 PINE CODE § 19-2
18:106
deposits exceeding insurable limits) and all other applicable federal, state
and local requirements.
§ 19-3. Scope.
§ 19-4. Standards of care.
A. This Investment Policy applies to all financial assets of the Township of
Pine which are funds accounted for in the Township of Pine Annual
Financial Report and includes the following funds:
(1) General Fund.
(2) Recreation Fund.
(3) Transportation Impact Fund.
(4) Water/Sewer District Fund.
(5) Capital Projects Fund.
(6) Liquid Fuels Fund.
(7) Any new fund created by the legislative body, unless specifically
exempted.
B. The Investment Policy excludes the Deferred Compensation and
Municipal Employees' Pension Funds, for which the Township acts as
trustee or fiduciary. Investments in these funds are determined by the
individual employees, and the plan assets can only be used for the
employees or their beneficiaries. Consequently, these funds fall outside
the scope of this policy.
A. Prudence.
(1) The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall
be the "prudent person" standard. Officers and designated
employees acting in accordance with this investment policy and
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal liability for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided
deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(2) The "prudent person" standard states that, "Investments shall be
made with judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of
their capital as well as the probable income to be derived."
B. Ethics and conflicts of interest.
(1) Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall
refrain from personal activity that could conflict with the proper
§ 19-2 FIRE DISTRICTS § 19-4
18:107
§ 19-5. General objectives.
The primary objectives of this Investment Policy, in order of priority, are:
execution and management of the investment program, or that
could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
(2) The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission
requires public officials and certain public employees to file a
statement of financial interests form pursuant to the provisions of
the Public Official and Employee Ethics Law, Act 170 of 1978 as
amended by Act 9 of 1989, 65 P.S. § 401 et seq. Officers and
employees making investment decisions must file the statement of
financial interests form no later than May 1 of each year.
C. Delegation of authority and responsibilities.
(1) While ultimate authority rests with the governing body (the Board
of Supervisors), the Township of Pine Code delegates authority to
the Township Manager. Chapter 2, Article IV, § 2-21C states that
the Township Manager, as head of the Department of
Administration, is responsible for "the administration of activities
pertaining to the receipt, expenditure, accounting, investment,
custody and control of municipal funds and assets." This
Investment Policy further establishes a Financial Management
Team, consisting of the following three individuals:
(a) Township Manager (Township Treasurer).
(b) Assistant Treasurer.
(c) Financial Administrator.
(d) Two members of the Board of Supervisors.
(2) The Financial Management Team shall consult together in making
investment decisions and shall act responsibly as custodians of the
public trust. No team member may engage in an investment
transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy. Team
members acting in accordance with this investment policy and
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal liability for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided
that deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(3) The governing body (Board of Supervisors) retains ultimate
fiduciary responsibility and decision making authority for
investments and cash management. The Board will receive
performance updates as requested and review the investment
policy annually.
A. Safety. Preservation of principal is the foremost objective. Investments
shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation
§ 19-4 PINE CODE § 19-5
18:108
§ 19-6. Specific objectives.
The Financial Management Team will consider the following factors when
making investment decisions:
of capital in the overall portfolio. The goal will be to mitigate credit risk
and interest rate risk.
B. Liquidity. Investments shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all
operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
C. Return on investment. Funds shall be invested with the objective of
attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints of safety and
liquidity needs.
A. Diversification: The purpose of diversification is to reduce the overall
risk within the investment portfolio while attaining market/benchmark
rates of return. The Township of Pine shall diversify its investments
among institutions to prevent over-concentration in an entity. As a
guideline, no more than 50% of the Township's total financial assets
should be invested in a single financial institution or security type. This
percentage limit is a guideline to insure diversification; however, a
reasonable temporary imbalance will not significantly impair this
strategy as long as it is monitored regularly. [Amended 5-7-2018 by
Res. No. 990]
B. Maximum maturities: The Financial Management Team will attempt to
match maturity dates of investments as closely as possible with
anticipated cash flow requirements. In the General Fund, investments
will be limited to those with maturity dates of one year or less. In the
other funds, a longer maturity date may be used only if the rate of
return is advantageous and the maturity date coincides with the
expected use of the funds.
C. Performance standards:
(1) The financial assets of the Township will be managed in accordance
with the parameters specified within this policy, but the
expectation is that the assets should obtain a market average rate
of return during an economic environment of stable interest rates.
When interest rates are forecast to rise in the near future, the
"prudent person" standard dictates that care be taken not to tie up
large amounts of funds at a fixed interest rate that is expected to be
lower than the expected future market rate. Conversely, when
interest rates are forecast to decline, it is prudent to take
advantage of investments bearing an interest rate that is higher
than the expected future market rate.
(2) Financial performance should be gauged against an appropriate
benchmark, such as the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the
monthly average federal funds rate.
§ 19-5 FIRE DISTRICTS § 19-7
18:109
§ 19-7. Authorized investments.
§ 19-8. Custodial credit risk, PA Act 72.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of a bank failure, the
government's deposits may not be returned to it. Bank balances up to
$250,000 per bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). Investments of Township financial assets shall first
conform to the requirements of the Second Class Township Code. In
addition, when the value of the Township's deposits exceeds the insurable
limits of the institution, the additional sums shall be secured by collateral
pledged by the depository pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 72 of 1971 (72
P.S. § 3836-1 et seq., "Standardizing the Procedures for Pledges of Assets")
which requires banks to pledge collateral for Township deposits in excess
of $250,000. Act 72 of 1971 was amended by Act 139 of 2000 to permit
the depository institution to secure its public deposits with a Federal Home
Loan Bank letter of credit rather than with a pledge of collateral.
§ 19-9. Investment Policy adoption.
The Township of Pine Investment Policy shall be adopted by resolution of
the Board of Supervisors. The policy shall be reviewed at least annually and
modifications made thereto must be approved by the Board of Supervisors.

B. Employee contributions. Employees shall neither be required nor

if:
(1) The contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the
contribution is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of
the contribution; or
(2) The plan is terminated, as provided in § 32-19D.
A. Upon retirement on his normal retirement date, a participant who
retires on or after the effective date shall be entitled to a monthly
retirement benefit, expressed in the form of a life annuity with 10 years
certain and commencing at normal retirement date which shall be
equal to 1 1/2% of his average monthly earnings multiplied by his years
of credited service.
B. The benefit amount of a participant who retired prior to the

terms of the plan (or, where applicable, of the heretofore unfunded
pension program) in effect on the day preceding the effective date.
A. If a participant shall retire on an early retirement date, he shall be
entitled to receive, upon making an election therefor, either:
(1) A deferred pension commencing at normal retirement date equal to
his accrued benefit determined as of his early retirement date; or
(2) An immediate pension commencing on his early retirement date (or

retirement date and by 1/360 for each of the 61st through 120th
months by which such early commencement date precedes his
normal retirement date.
B. Notice of early retirement. Each participant who desires to retire at a
date earlier than his normal retirement date, in accordance with § 32-5,
shall notify the employer and the committee prior to such date by
written notice setting forth his proposed retirement date.
§ 32-3 PINE CODE § 32-6
32:122
§ 32-6. Late retirement.
If a participant remains in the employ of the employer subsequent to his
normal retirement date, he shall continue to be eligible to participate
hereunder but he shall not be credited with any additional years of credited
service subsequent to his normal retirement date; provided, however, that
in no case shall a participant's late retirement date be later than the first
of the month coincident with or immediately following the date when he
attains age 70. A participant who retires on a late retirement date shall be
entitled to receive a monthly pension which shall be the actuarial equivalent
of his normal retirement benefit determined in accordance with the formula
set forth in § 32-4 and based upon his years of credited service as of his

§ 32-7. Disability retirement.
§ 32-8. Death benefits.
A. If a participant who is an employee of the employer becomes totally and
permanently disabled, as defined in Subsection B, such participant's
disability retirement date shall be the date as of which he is first eligible
to receive social security benefits. A participant's disability retirement
benefit shall be equal to his accrued benefit determined as of the first
day of the month immediately preceding the last day on which he was
actively employed by the employer.
B. "Totally and permanently disabled" shall mean a condition of physical or
mental impairment due to which a participant is unable to perform any
and every duty of a gainful occupation for which he is reasonably fitted
through training, education and experience, which continues for a
period of at least six months and will be permanent and continuous for
the remainder of the participant's lifetime and due to which a
participant is certified by the Social Security Administration as being
eligible for social security disability benefits; provided, however, that no
participant shall be deemed to be "totally and permanently disabled" for
the purpose of this plan if his incapacity results from chronic alcoholism
or addiction to narcotics or was engaged in a felonious criminal
enterprise or resulted therefrom or resulted from an intentionally selfinflicted
injury or if such disability was incurred while in the armed
services of any country.
C. The employer may require proof of continued disability but not more
frequently than once in any six-month period. If any participant shall
refuse to submit to a medical examination or furnish proof of his
continued disability upon the request of the employer, his disability
payments shall cease.
D. Commencement of benefits. Monthly retirement benefits shall
commence on the first day of the month following the month in which a
participant retires on a retirement date pursuant to §§ 32-4, 32-5, 32-6
and 32-7 above.
§ 32-6 PENSIONS § 32-8
32:123
§ 32-9. Optional forms of benefit payment.
A. Preretirement surviving spouse benefit. If a married participant dies
while in the active service of the employer at a time when he is eligible
to retire on an early retirement date or if such a participant terminates
employment with the employer at a time when he is eligible to receive
early or normal retirement benefits and dies thereafter but prior to the
date when his benefits commence, then the spouse of such participant
shall be eligible to receive a monthly benefit, provided that the
participant and his spouse have been married throughout the one-year
period ending on the date of the participant's death. The monthly
benefit payable to the spouse shall be equal to the pension such spouse
would have been eligible to receive if the participant had retired under
the early retirement provisions of the plan on the first day of the month
in which his death occurs with a fifty-percent contingent annuitant
option in effect, with the spouse as contingent annuitant.
B. Postretirement death benefit. If a terminated participant shall die after
benefit payments have commenced, no death benefits shall be payable
under this section, and the death benefit payable, if any, shall be that
which is specified pursuant to the form of benefit payment in force for
the benefit of such person at the time of his death.
A. The automatic form of payment of retirement benefits shall be the form
specified in § 32-4 unless a participant elects to receive his benefits in
some other form as provided herein. If a participant who retires under
this article elects not to take his benefits in the automatic form of
payment, any such retirement benefit may be distributed by the trustee
in such manner as the plan administrator, in its sole discretion, shall
determine, after consultation with the participant. Such distribution, as
determined by the plan administrator, may be in any actuarially
equivalent optional method of settlement that is permitted by the plan
administrator. Any optional form of payment shall be the actuarial
equivalent of the automatic form of payment.
B. The provisions of this section shall be subject to the limitation that no
participant shall elect an interest option or an installment distribution
to be paid over a period which shall exceed the greater of:
(1) The life of the participant;
(2) The life expectancy of the participant;
(3) The joint lives of the participant and his beneficiary; or
(4) The joint life expectancy of the participant and his beneficiary.
C. A participant may not elect an optional form of pension providing
monthly benefits to a contingent annuitant who is other than his spouse,
or to a beneficiary, unless the actuarial present value of the payments
expected to be made to the participant is more than 50% of the
§ 32-8 PINE CODE § 32-9
32:124
§ 32-10. Maximum benefit limitations.
actuarial present value of the total payment expected to be made under
such optional form.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, no benefit provided
under this plan attributable to contributions of the employer shall
exceed, as an annual amount, the lesser of:
(1) Ninety thousand dollars, assuming a single life annuity or qualified
joint and survivor annuity (as defined for purposes of Code Section
415),44 subject to cost-of-living adjustments made from time to time
by plan amendments or automatically in accordance with and in
such amounts as are prescribed in or pursuant to regulations
promulgated under Section 415(d) of the code (which adjustments
shall not become effective prior to January 1 of the year for which
such adjustment is made); or
(2) One hundred percent of the participant's average compensation for
the three consecutive years of employment (or such lesser number
as may apply if the employee does not have three consecutive
years) in which he received the highest aggregate compensation
while a participant, and the rate of benefit accrual shall be frozen
or reduced accordingly, subject to the provisions of Subsection B
below.
B. The limitation provided in Subsection A above shall be subject to the
following conditions:
(1) For purposes of the above limitations, "compensation" shall mean
the participant's wages, salaries, fees for professional services and
other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in
the course of employment with an employer maintaining the plan
(including, but not limited to, commissions paid salesmen,
commissions on insurance premiums, tips and bonuses). The term
"compensation," as used in this section, shall not include items
such as the following:
(a) Contributions made by the employer to a plan of deferred
compensation to the extent that before the application of Code
Section 41545 limitations to that plan, the contributions are not
includable in the gross income of the employee for the taxable
year in which contributed. In addition, employer contributions
made on behalf of an employee to a simplified employee
pension described in Code Section 408(k) are not considered
as compensation for the taxable year in which contributed to
the extent such contributions are deductible by the employee
under Code Section 219(b)(7). Additionally, any distributions
44.Editor's Note: See the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
45.Editor's Note: See the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
§ 32-9 PENSIONS § 32-10
32:125
from a plan of deferred compensation are not considered as
compensation for Section 415 purposes, regardless of whether
such amounts are includable in the gross income of the
employee when distributed. However, any amounts received by
an employee pursuant to an unfunded nonqualified plan may
be considered as compensation for Code Section 415 purposes
in the year such amounts are includable in the gross income of
the employee.
(b) Other amounts which receive special tax benefits, such as
premiums for group-term life insurance (but only to the extent
that the premiums are not includable in the gross income of the
employee) or contributions made by an employer (whether or
not under a salary reduction agreement) towards the purchase
of an annuity contract described in the Internal Revenue Code
Section 403(b) (whether or not the contributions are
excludable from the gross income of the employee).
(2) For purposes of the above limitations, if the benefit under the plan
is payable in any form other than in the forms described therein
(without regard to ancillary benefits) or if the employees contribute
to the plan or make rollover contributions, the determination as to
whether the limitations have been satisfied shall be made by
adjusting the benefit so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the
benefit described in Subsection A. For the purpose of making the
adjustment in the form of the benefit to an actuarial equivalent, the
interest rate shall not be less than the greater of 5% or the rate
specified under the plan's definition of actuarial equivalent.
(3) If retirement income benefits commence prior to a participant's
attainment of age 62, the limitation contained in Subsection A(1)
shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of
$90,000 commencing at age 62. The reduction under this
subsection shall not reduce the limitation of Subsection A(1) below
$75,000, if the benefit begins at or after age 55 or, if the benefit
begins before age 55, the amount which is the equivalent to the
limitation of $75,000 for age 55. For the purpose of making this
adjustment, the interest rate used shall not be less than the greater
of 5% or the rate specified in the plan's definition of actuarial
equivalent.
(4) If retirement income benefits commence after the participant's
attainment of age 65, the limitation described in Subsection A(1)
shall be adjusted so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an
annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit
begins) which is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of
$90,000 commencing at age 65; provided, however, that in no case
shall such benefit exceed the limitation contained in Subsection
A(2). For the purpose of making this adjustment, the interest rate
assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5% or the rate
specified in the plan's definition of actuarial equivalent.
§ 32-10 PINE CODE § 32-10
32:126
§ 32-11. Nonduplication of benefits.
To avoid any duplication of benefits, if any participant ceases to be
employed for any reason and is reemployed, any benefit payments then
being paid pursuant to the terms of this plan shall be suspended, and future
retirement benefits shall be coordinated in such a manner as to preclude
any duplication hereunder.
§ 32-12. Distribution of small value benefits.
In its sole discretion, the Committee may direct the trustee to distribute
in the form of a lump sum payment to a participant who is terminating his
participation in the plan such participant's vested benefit if the actuarial
present value of such benefit is $3,500 or less and such participant is onehundred-
percent vested in his accrued benefit hereunder. Any distribution
made pursuant to this section shall be made within one year after a
participant terminates service with the employer.
§ 32-13. Commencement of retirement benefits.
(5) Benefits payable to a participant under this plan shall be deemed
not to exceed the limitations imposed by Subsection A if the annual
benefit payable to such participant does not exceed $10,000 (for
this year or any prior year), provided that such participant has
never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the
employer.
(6) In the event that a participant has less than 10 years of service, the
limitations described in Subsections A and B(5) of this section shall
be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
years of service credited to the participant and the denominator of
which is 10.
(7) For purposes of applying the limitations of this section, all defined
benefit plans of the employer shall be treated as one defined
benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans shall be treated as
one defined contribution plan.
(8) For purposes of the above limitations, the limitation year shall be
the plan year, unless such period is otherwise defined in a written
resolution adopted by the employer.
A. A participant may elect to commence receiving distribution of his
retirement benefits as of his normal retirement date, late retirement
date or disability retirement date, whichever is applicable, or may defer
such payments to a date not later than the required date for
commencement of benefits determined under § 32-14. If a participant
elects immediate commencement of his retirement benefit, payments
shall commence as soon as administratively feasible following his
retirement date.

32:127
§ 32-14. Required distributions.
B. Unless the participant otherwise elects, payment of his benefits under
the plan shall commence not later than 60 days following the close of

(2) The 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant
commenced participation in the plan; or
(3) The date when the participant terminates his service with the

life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and
a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life
expectancy of such participant and a designated beneficiary).
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior
to the date when his entire interest has been distributed to him
after distribution of his benefits has begun in accordance with
Subsection A(1)(b) above, the remaining portion of such benefit
shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of
distribution being used under Subsection A(1)(b) as of the date of
his death.
B. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies before
distribution of his benefit has begun, the entire interest of such
employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable, if any portion of
the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such
designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life
expectancy of such beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later
than one year after the date of the employee's death or such later date
as provided by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury,
then, for purposes of the five-year rule set forth in the preceding
sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as
distributed on the date on which such distributions begin; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then
the date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be

earlier than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2 and, provided, further, that if the surviving spouse dies before

(3) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined, but not more frequently than

participant's normal retirement date had he continued his
employment. Notwithstanding the preceding, a participant with an
entitlement to a vested benefit may elect to commence receiving
such benefit as of the date when he would have been eligible for an
early retirement pension as provided in § 32-5 had he continued
employment with the employer; provided, however, that any
payment of a vested accrued benefit as of a participant's early
retirement date shall be subject to the reduction factor for early
payment set forth in § 32-5. A participant eligible to receive his
vested benefit shall be permitted to receive such benefit in any
form of payment authorized for payment of retirement benefits
under the provisions of § 32-9; provided, however, that he may elect
an optional form of payment only with the consent of the plan
administrator. The plan administrator shall, after consulting with
the participant, and subject to the provisions of § 32-14, determine
the time and form of any distribution of vested benefits hereunder
in a nondiscriminatory manner and not contrary to any laws or
regulations which may govern such distributions.
(3) A participant shall always be one-hundred-percent vested in any
portion of his accrued benefit attributable to employee
contributions.
B. Vesting at normal retirement date. Notwithstanding the preceding, a
participant shall become one-hundred-percent vested as of his normal
retirement date.
C. Forfeiture upon death. A participant who terminates his employment
with the employer at a time when he is not vested in any portion of his
accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall cease to be a
participant hereunder and shall not be entitled to any benefits under
the plan derived from employer contributions. Payment of a
participant's vested retirement benefit depends upon his continued
survival to the date of his actual retirement on either an early
retirement date or normal retirement date hereunder.
D. Application of forfeitures. Amounts forfeited by any participant may not
be used to increase the benefits which other participants would
otherwise receive under the plan; they shall be used only to reduce the
employer's contributions to the plan.
§ 32-15 PINE CODE § 32-16

A. Plan administrator.
(1) The administration of this plan shall be vested in the plan
administrator, who shall have the power and duty to operate and

efficient administration of the plan.
(2) The plan administrator hereunder shall be the Board of Supervisors
of the Township of Pine.
(3) The plan administrator may appoint such subcommittees with such
powers as it shall determine; may authorize one or more of its
members to execute or deliver any instrument or do any act on its
behalf; and may employ counsel and agents and such clerical,
accounting and actuarial services as it may require in carrying out
the provisions of the plan.
(4) Any act which the plan administrator is authorized or required to
perform hereunder may be performed by a majority of its members.
The action of such majority expressed from time to time by voting
at a meeting, or in writing without a meeting, shall constitute the
action of the plan administrator and shall have the same effect for
all purposes as if assented to by all members then in office.
(5) The plan administrator shall have the power to determine the
eligibility of any employee to participate in or receive benefits
under this plan, to settle any disputes which may arise in the
operation of the plan, to determine the interest of any participant in
the trust fund on the basis of their present market value in such
manner, consistently applied, as the plan administrator or, at the
direction of the plan administrator, the trustee, may deem
appropriate, in the form of periodic payments, or any combination
of the foregoing.
(6) All discretionary acts which may be taken pursuant to this plan by
the plan administrator with respect to participants or their
beneficiaries shall be uniform and nondiscriminatory in their
nature and shall be applicable to all participants and their
beneficiaries in substantially identical situations.
(7) Any decision by the plan administrator denying a claim by a
participant or a beneficiary for benefits under the plan shall be
communicated in writing to the participant or beneficiary, setting
forth the specific reasons for such denial. Any such participant or
beneficiary whose claim has been denied, or his or her duly
authorized representative, may appeal to the plan administrator in
writing within 90 days after receipt of the notice of denial for a full
review of the decision by the plan administrator; review pertinent
documents; and submit issues and comments in writing. The
decision by the plan administrator following such review shall be
made no later than 60 days after the date of receipt by the plan

to all persons affected thereby. Such decision shall be in writing
and shall include both specific reasons for the decision, written in
a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and specific
references to the pertinent plan provisions on which the decision is
based.
B. Trustee.
(1) The Township's governing body shall serve as trustee hereunder to
hold and invest the contributions in accordance with the terms of
the agreement of trust, incorporated as § 32-17 hereof.
(2) The trust shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the plan and,
to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the expenses
of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.
(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the trust required under the plan. The employer
shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in the trust;
benefits are payable only from the trust, and only to the extent that
there are moneys available therein.
A. Establishment and acceptance of trust. The trust will consist of all funds
held by the trustee under the plan, including contributions made
pursuant to the provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments
and proceeds thereof. The trust shall be held, managed and
administered in trust pursuant to the terms of the plan. The trustee
hereby accepts the trust created hereunder and agrees to perform the
duties under the plan on its part to be performed. Except as otherwise
expressly provided for in the plan, the trustee has exclusive authority
and discretion to manage and control the trust assets. The duties,
powers and responsibilities reserved to the trustee may be allocated
among the trustees (if there be more than one) so long as such
allocation is pursuant to action taken by the employer, or by written
agreement executed by the trustee and approved by the employer, in
which case no trustee shall have any liability, with respect to any duties,
powers or responsibilities not allocated to him, for the acts or omissions
of any other trustee.
B. Powers and duties of trustee. With respect to the trust the trustee shall
have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition to those vested
in it elsewhere in the plan or by law:
(1) To retain in cash so much of the trust as it deems advisable and to
deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial

institution, including any such institution which may be a trustee
hereunder, without liability for interest thereon.
(2) To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and
keep said fund invested, without distinction between principal and

fiduciaries under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act of
1949, or as the same may be subsequently modified or amended.
(3) To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
exchange such property, and to grant options for the purchase or
exchange thereof.
(4) To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting
property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation
pursuant to any such plan.

fund and in connection therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.
(7) To cause any securities or other property held as part of the trust
fund to be registered in its own name or in the name of one or more
of its nominees, without designating the same as trust property,
and to hold any investments in bearer form, but the books and
records of the trustee shall at all times show that all such
investments are part of the trust fund.
(8) Generally, to do all such acts, execute all such instruments, take all
such proceedings and exercise all such rights and privileges with
relation to property constituting the trust fund as if the trustee
were the absolute owner thereof.
(9) If bonds, preferred stocks or other securities shall be purchased at
a premium, it shall not be necessary for the trustee to set aside a
sinking fund from the earnings to retire or absorb the premium.
(10) To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed by the trustee
to be appropriate for the purposes of this trust, no matter where
situated, including the savings department of its on commercial
bank. Such deposits may be for such duration as the trustee, in its
sole discretion, may determine.
(11) In addition to the foregoing powers, the trustee shall also have all
of the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon Trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Act of 1949, 20 P.S. § 320, or as the same
§ 32-17 PENSIONS § 32-17
32:133
may be subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do
all acts, take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges,
although not specifically mentioned herein, as the trustee may
deem necessary to administer the trust fund and to carry out the
purposes of this trust.
(12) To invest the assets of the trust in any collective commingled trust
fund maintained by a bank or trust company, including any bank or
trust company which may act as a trustee hereunder. In this
connection, the commingling of the assets of the trust with assets
of other eligible, participating trusts through such a medium is
hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the trust which may be
so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to all of the
provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as amended from
time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to the extent
of the participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by
the trust.
(13) To make any payment or distribution directed by the employer or
otherwise required or advisable to carry out the provisions of the
plan.
(14) To compromise, content, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands.
(15) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
liability for the payment of interest thereon and to decline to make

(16) After advance notice to the employer, to pay, and to deduct from the
charge against the trust, any taxes which may be imposed upon the
trust, the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with
respect to the interest of any person therein, which the trustee is
required to pay; to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount
of any tax, assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or
made against or in respect of the trust, the income, property or
transfer thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith,
provided that the trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction.
C. Management authority. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection B,
the powers granted the trustee thereunder shall be exercised in the
discretion of the trustee; however, the employer may at any time
affirmatively direct the trustee with regard to the investment of the
trust, or direct the trustee to obtain the employer's approval before
exercising any of the powers granted the trustee. Any such direction
may be of a continuing nature or otherwise, may be revoked at any time
and shall be complied with as promptly as possible by the trustee. The
trustee shall not be liable for any loss or depreciation in value of the
trust or any adverse effect upon the exempt status of the trust under the
§ 32-17 PINE CODE § 32-17
32:134
code, resulting from actions taken in accordance with the employer's
affirmative direction or from the failure or refusal of the employer to
give any required approval, nor shall the trustee be obliged to review
the assets of the trust acquired on the direction of the employer.
D. Successor trustee. Pending the appointment of any successor trustee
and the acceptance of such appointment, the existing trustee or
trustees shall have full power to take any action hereunder. Each
successor or additional trustee shall have all rights and powers, as well
as duties and liabilities, vested in the original trustee without the
signing or filing of any further instrument, but any resigning or
removed trustee shall execute all documents and do all acts necessary
to vest title of record to any assets of the trust in any successor trustee
or in the remaining trustee or trustees. With the approval of the
employer, a successor trustee may accept the account rendered and the
property delivered to it by a predecessor trustee as a full and complete
discharge of the predecessor trustee, without incurring any liability or
responsibility for so doing.
E. Common investments. The trustee shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest
contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
F. Compensation and expenses of trustee. The trustee shall be entitled to
such reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed
upon by the employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is
prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably
incurred by the trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a
charge upon the employer or the trust fund which may be executed at
any time after 30 days written notice to the employer. The employer
shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the
event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same,
or to reimburse itself for the payment thereof from the trust.
G. Immunity and liability of trustee.
(1) The trustee shall not be liable for the making, retention or sale of
any investment or reinvestment made by it, as herein provided, nor
for any loss to, or diminution of, the trust fund, unless due to its
own intentional or willful misconduct, lack of good faith or gross
negligence.
(2) The trustee shall be fully protected in acting upon any instrument,
certificate or paper believed by it to be genuine and to be signed or
presented by the proper person or persons, and the trustee shall be
under no duty to make any investigation or any inquiry as to any
statement contained in any writing, but may accept the same as
conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of the statements
therein contained.
§ 32-17 PENSIONS § 32-17
32:135
(3) The trustee shall not be liable for the proper application of any part
of the trust if payments are made in accordance with the directions
of the employer as herein provided, and the trustee shall not be
obliged to inquire as to whether any payee is entitled to any
payment or distribution, pursuant to such directions, or as to
whether any payment or distribution, pursuant to such directions,
is proper or within the terms of the plan. The trustee shall not be
required to make any investigation to determine the identity or
mailing address of any person entitled to benefits under the plan
and shall be entitled to withhold making any payments or deliveries
upon instructions from the employer.
(4) The trustee shall not be responsible for the adequacy of the trust to
meet and discharge any and all payments and liabilities under the
plan. The trustee shall be responsible only for such sums as shall
actually be received by it as trustee, hereunder, and it shall not be
the duty of the trustee to collect, or to ascertain the correctness of
the amount of, any sum receivable or received from the employer.
(5) The trustee shall discharge its duties with respect to the assets of
the trust solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,
administering the assets of the plan with the care and diligence,
under the then prevailing circumstances, that a prudent man
acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in
the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims.
H. Financial records. The trustee shall maintain records and accounts
reflecting all receipts and disbursements made by it under the plan and
showing such other items and information as the employer from time to
time may specify. The trustee's records and accounts shall be open to
the inspection of the employer at all reasonable times and may be
audited from time to time by such person or persons as the employer
may specify.
I. Periodic accounting. The trust will be evaluated annually, or at more
frequent intervals, by the trustee, and a written accounting rendered as
of each fiscal year end of the trust, and as of the effective date of any
removal of resignation of the trustee, and such additional dates as
requested by the employer, showing the condition of the trust and all
receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by the trustee
during the period covered by the accounting, based on fair market
values prevailing as of such date. Any such accounting shall be due
within 90 days after the date thereof; to the extent permitted by law,
upon the expiration of 180 days from the filing of such accounting, the
trustee shall be forever released, revised and discharged from all
liability and accountability to anyone with respect to the propriety of its
accounts and transactions shown in such accounts except with respect
to any such accounts or transactions as to which the employer shall
within such one-hundred-eighty-day period file written exceptions. All
determinations as to the value of the assets of the trust, and as to the
amount of the liabilities thereof shall be made by the trustee, whose

§ 32-18. Amendments to plan and trust.
The employer shall have the right to amend the plan and trust, at any
time, and with respect to any provisions thereof, and all parties thereto
or claiming any interest thereunder shall be bound thereby; provided,
however, that no amendment shall revise the accrued benefit of a
participant determined as of the later of the date such amendment is
adopted, or the date such amendment becomes effective, is such revised
vested accrued benefit is less than that computed under the plan without
regard to such amendment.
§ 32-19. Employer termination of plan.
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the
opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers and
other experts, and the trustee shall also be entitled to rely upon reports
as to sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
J. Rights of trustee. The rights and interest of any participant on whose
life or in whose name a contract is issued shall not be expanded by such
an investment and any and all rights provided under the contract or
permitted by the insurer shall be reserved to the trustee. Such rights
shall include the right to surrender, reduce or split the contract, the
right to name and change the payee to receive thereunder on the
happening of any contingency specified in the contract, the right to
exercise any loan provisions to pay premiums or for any other reason
and such other rights as may be reserved to the owner of the policy.
K. Actions of insurer. No insurer which may issue a policy for the purpose
of this plan shall be required to take or permit any action contrary to
the provisions of said policy nor shall the insurer be required to look
into the terms of this plan, or question any action as authorized by the
trustee in the application for a policy or changes in an existing policy.
L. Insurer not a party to plan. The insurer shall not be deemed to be a
party to this plan for any purpose nor shall it be responsible for the
validity of this plan.
A. Right to terminate. It is the present intention of the employer to
maintain the plan indefinitely. Nevertheless, the employer reserves the
right, at any time, to permanently discontinue further contributions to
the trust or to terminate the entire plan and trust.
B. Automatic termination of contributions. The liability of the employer to
make contributions to the trust shall automatically terminate upon
liquidation of the employer, upon its adjudication as bankrupt, upon the
making of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or upon its
merger into or consolidation with any other corporation or corporations
§ 32-17 PENSIONS § 32-19
32:137
§ 32-20. Compliance with standards.
and failure of the surviving corporation or consolidated corporation to
specifically adopt and agree to continue the plan.
C. Distribution upon termination. In the event of the termination or partial
termination of the plan, all amounts of benefits accrued by the affected
participant to the date of such termination, to the extent funded on such
date, shall immediately become fully vested and nonforfeitable. In the
event of termination of the plan, the employer shall direct that:
[Amended 2-3-1992 by Res. No. 394]
(1) The trustee continue to hold the accrued benefits of participants in
the trust fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other
than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such
termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance
with such provisions;
(2) The trustee immediately distribute to each participant an amount
equal to his accrued benefit as of such date; or
(3) The trustee transfer the accrued benefits of participants in the
trust fund to another qualified retirement plan.
D. Residual assets. If all liabilities under the plan to participants and
others entitled to receive a benefit have been satisfied and there remain
any residual assets in the trust fund, the residual assets shall be divided
among the participants in the plan at the date of termination of the plan
pursuant to an allocation formula set forth by the employer which does
not contravene any provision of the law. [Amended 2-3-1992 by Res.
No. 394]
A. Actuarial evaluations. The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial
valuation at least biennially unless the employer is applying or has
applied for supplemental state assistance pursuant to section 603 of the
Act,46 whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the
beginning of each plan year occurring in an off-numbered calendar
year, beginning with the year 1985. Such actuarial valuation shall be
prepared and certified by an approved actuary, as such term is defined
in the Act.
B. Reporting requirements. Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and
filed under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer of the
municipality. The Chief Administrative Officer of the pension plan shall
determine the financial requirements of the pension plan on the basis of
the most recent actuarial report and shall determine the minimum
obligation of the employer with respect to funding the plan for any
given plan year. The Chief Administrative Officer shall submit the

§ 32-21. Incapacity of pensioner.
If any pensioner shall be physically or mentally incapable of receiving or
acknowledging receipt of any payment of pension benefits hereunder, the
trustee, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such pensioner is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining him and
that no guardian or committee has been appointed for him, may provide for
such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such person or institution so
maintaining him, and any such payments so made shall be deemed for every
purpose to have been made to such pensioner.
§ 32-22. Payment of benefits for deceased participant.
If any benefit shall be payable under the plan to or on behalf of a participant
who has died, if the plan provides that the payment of such benefits shall
be made to the participant's estate, and if no administration of such
participant's estate is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the
trustee, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving spouse
of such deceased participant, or, if there be no such surviving spouse, to
such participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the trustee from insisting upon the
commencement of estate administration proceedings and the delivery of
any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or administrator.
§ 32-23. Liability of employer.
Subject to the provisions of the Act,47 no past, present or future officer of
the employer shall be personally liable to any participant, beneficiary or
other person under any provision of the plan or trust or any policy issued
pursuant thereto.
§ 32-24. Participants not to receive interest in trust assets.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give any participant or his
beneficiary any interest in any specific property of the trust or any right
financial requirements of the plan and the minimum obligation of the
employer to the Board and/or to the employer annually and shall certify
the accuracy of such calculations and their conformance with the Act.
C. Benefit modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the Board, the Chief Administrative Officer of the plan
shall provide to the Board a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary,
which estimate shall disclose to the Board the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the
plan and the future minimum obligation of the employer with respect to
the plan.

32:139
except to receive such distributions as are expressly provided for in this
plan.
§ 32-25. Plan not to affect employment rights.
Participation in this plan shall not give any right to any employee to be
retained in the employ of the employer, nor shall it interfere with the
right of the employer to discharge any employee and to deal with him
without regard to the effect that such treatment might have upon him as a
participant in this plan.
§ 32-26. Use of trust fund.
The income and principal of the trust fund are for the sole use and benefit
of the participants of this plan, and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be
free, clear and discharged of and from and are not to be in any way liable
for, debts, contracts or agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter
be contracted, and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred
by any participant or beneficiary.
§ 32-27. Word usage.
As used herein, the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender and
the singular shall include the plural in all cases where such meaning would
be appropriate. Headings of sections are inserted only for convenience of
reference and are not to be considered in the construction of the plan.
§ 32-28. Information to be furnished by employer.
The employer shall furnish to the Retirement Committee and the trustee
information in the employer's possession as the Retirement Committee and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under the
plan and the trust.
§ 32-29. Tax-exempt status of trust.
The employer intends that the trust herein created shall qualify as an
exempt organization within the meaning of Section 501(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954, or under any comparable section of any future
legislation which amends, supplements or supersedes said section, and until
advised to the contrary, the trustee may assume that the trust is so qualified
and is entitled to tax exemption. Nevertheless, all taxes of any and all kinds
whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under the existing or future laws
upon the trust fund or the income thereof and investment charges, shall
be paid from the trust fund. The trustee may assume that any such taxes
are lawfully levied or assessed unless, subsequent to notification to the plan
administrator of such action as the plan administrator shall direct, but all
expenses incident thereto shall be chargeable to the Trust Fund, unless
otherwise directed by the plan administrator.

or fill, make such permit necessary. This exception shall not affect the
applicability of this chapter to or the requirement of a grading permit
for any fill made with the material from such excavation unless such fill
is within the exception of Subsection B herein. A grading permit shall
not be required for the temporary stockpiling on the same site of the
material from such excavation, however such temporary stockpiling
shall not create excessively steep slopes.
D. A single-family house site where the maximum slope between property
lines or the maximum excavation or fill, exclusive of the situations
referred to in § 48-5C hereof, do not exceed the slopes or quantities set
forth in the following table:

land after completion of the proposed grading at a scale of not
greater than 50 feet to one inch and at a contour interval of not less
than two feet and a plan showing cross sections of the proposed cut
or fill on fifty-foot intervals which show the method of benching
both cut and/or fill; however, under no circumstances shall there be
less than two cross sections for each property involved under said
permit; a plot plan showing the location of the grading, boundaries,
lot lines, neighboring streets and ways, existing and proposed
buildings, existing waterlines and sewers or drains, existing utility
lines, trees over 12 inches in diameter measured at breast height
(DBH) above the ground and sufficient dimensions and other data

48:159
§ 48-7. Fees.
Before issuing a permit, the Administrator shall collect a permit fee in the

§ 48-8. Bond required.
Before issuance of a permit, the applicant shall post a bond, with corporate
surety or other approved security as set forth in this section, in an amount
of 110% of the estimated cost of the work to guarantee the completion
of said work, including surface treatment, drainage, and site restoration
contemplated by the permit. In the event that the applicant will move or
grade more than 50,000 square feet or more than 30,000 cubic yards, then
a formal security agreement shall be required by the Board of Supervisors
of the Township of Pine. Said agreement will be prepared by the Township
Solicitor and must be approved by the Township prior to the issuance of the
requested permit. No grading shall commence and no grading permit shall
be issued until the formal agreement, if required, is signed by both parties
and, in all cases, the security is posted.
§ 48-9. Expiration of permit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within six
months or is not completed within one year from the date of issue, provided
that the administrator may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory
evidence in writing that unusual difficulties have prevented the work being
started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable
extension of time and provided, further, that the application for the
extension of time is made before the date of expiration of the permit.
§ 48-10. Denial of permit.
Where, in the opinion of the Administrator, the work as proposed by the
applicant is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or is likely
to endanger any person, any property or any street or way, he shall deny
the grading permit. In determining whether the proposed work is likely
to endanger property or streets or alleys or streams or create hazardous
conditions or damage the ecology of the area, the Administrator shall give
due consideration to, but shall not be limited to, possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoff of surface waters and subsurface conditions,
such as the stratification and faulting of rock, and the nature and type of
the soil, rock or other minerals and the extent of removal, if any.
§ 48-11. Appeals.
The applicant may appeal the decision of the Administrator to the governing
body, which may consider alternate methods, standards or materials

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 56-17. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Township of Pine
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs),
dated September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including
all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study, and the
above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township of Pine and declared to
be a part of this chapter.
§ 56-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
§ 56-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 56-22B for situations where
FEMA notification is required.
A. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
B. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
§ 56-17 EXCAVATIONS AND GRADING § 56-20
48:197
§ 56-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township's governing body
(following receipt of any recommendation from the Township's Planning
Commission), and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 56-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

ARTICLE V
Technical Provisions
§ 56-22. General requirements.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the

§ 65-1. Designation of private roads.
At the time of the enactment of this chapter, the Township of Pine has
determined that 61 private roads have been constructed and currently exist
within the boundaries of the Township of Pine. Such 61 private roads are
identified by name and are each specified as belonging to one of four
classifications (Class A, B, C, or D, respectively) as set forth in an exhibit
hereto entitled "Township of Pine Private Road Index and Classification
Schedule," the provisions of which exhibit are incorporated herein by
reference as if hereby set forth at length in this section.66
§ 65-2. Criteria for classification.
The Township of Pine has reviewed each of the 61 private roads identified
in § 65-1 hereof for purposes of both classifying them and setting forth the
procedures and criteria under which any of them might be accepted in the
future as a public Township road. In establishing the classification of each
of the aforesaid private roads, the Township of Pine has considered, among
other elements: the number of housing units which presently exist upon
such private road; the amount and type of vehicular traffic thereon; and the
potential for additional development in the area of the existing private road,
and the likelihood of the amount of additional residential and/or commercial
structures to be served thereby and the amount and type of vehicular traffic
that would be occasioned by such additional development.
§ 65-3. Classification specifications.
In the event that the Township of Pine, pursuant to procedures set forth
herein, hereafter desires to accept any of the aforementioned private roads
as public Township roads, it shall do so only after such private road has
been previously improved and upgraded at the financial expense of parties
other than the Township prior to its acceptance, and according to its hereindesignated
classification, to the following specifications:
A. Class A: Dedication to the Township of a public right-of-way of a
minimum of 50 feet in width. Construction of a road surface (cartway)
and drainage thereof which satisfies the current Township
66.Editor's Note: Said exhibit is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 62-50 PINE CODE § 65-3
62:250
specifications for construction and drainage of new public roads, as
shown on Drawing No. R-1 as prepared by the Township's Engineer,
originally dated July, 2001, and with revisions thereto dated December,
2004, or latest subsequent revision date (as on file in the office of the
Township Manager), and provided that the width of the paved road
surface shall be a minimum of 20 feet and that, in addition, the road
shall have integral wing curbs of two feet constructed on both sides
thereof. Such road shall be required to also have the area specified for
turnaround and to have met all other requirements set forth in Chapter
72 ("Streets and Sidewalks") and § 84-125 ("Stormwater management")
of Chapter 84 ("Zoning") of the Code of the Township of Pine. In
addition, all preexisting, unacceptable cartway material shall have been
completely removed prior to construction of the new road surface
specified herein.
B. Class B: Dedication to the Township of a public right-of-way of a
minimum of 33 feet in width. Construction of a road surface (cartway)
of a minimum of 18 feet in width and, in addition, with construction of
one-and-one-half-foot-wide integral wing curbs on both sides thereof.
Such road shall also be required to have met all requirements of the
road specifications as prepared by the Township's Engineer in Drawing
No. R-2, originally dated July, 2001, and with revisions thereto dated
June, 2011, or latest subsequent revision date, as is on file in the office
of the Township Manager. Such road shall also be required to have met
the specifications for drainage and turnaround area as set forth in
Chapter 72 ("Streets and Sidewalks") and § 84-125 ("Stormwater
management") of Chapter 84 ("Zoning") of the Code of the Township of
Pine. In addition, all preexisting, unacceptable cartway material may be
required to have been completely removed prior to the construction of
the new road surface specified herein if such is so required by the
Township's Engineer due to unsatisfactory results of a roadway base
material analysis performed by such Engineer upon such preexisting
roadway material.
C. Class C: Dedication to the Township of a public right-of-way sufficient in
width, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors, to provide for: safe
public travel, accommodation of any necessary utilities, and
appropriate ability for public maintenance. Construction of a road
surface (cartway) of a minimum width sufficient, in the opinion of the
Board of Supervisors, to permit safe public travel and public
maintenance, and including construction of one-and-one-half-foot-wide
wing curbs on each side. Such road shall also be required to have met
all requirements of the road specifications as prepared by the Township
Engineer in Drawing No. R-2, originally dated July, 2001, and with
revisions thereto dated June, 2011, or latest subsequent revision date,
as is on file in the office of the Township Manager. Such road shall also
be required to have met the specifications for drainage and turnaround
area as set forth in Chapter 72 ("Streets and Sidewalks") and § 84-125
("Stormwater management") of Chapter 84 ("Zoning") of the Code of
the Township of Pine. In addition, such preexisting, unacceptable

Those private roads classified as Class D in § 65-5 of this chapter shall not
at any time in the future be accepted by the Township of Pine as public
Township roads under any circumstances.

roads).
cartway material shall be replaced as required by the Township's
Engineer based upon such Engineer's analysis of the degradation of
such existing material.
A. Based upon the review set forth in § 65-2 hereof and the classifications
set forth in § 65-3 and § 65-4 hereof, it has been determined by the
Board of Supervisors that the Township's aforementioned 61 existing
private roads are dividable into Classes A, B, C, and D and are,
henceforth, classified as follows:
(1) Class A: those 39 private roads identified as Class A on the attached
exhibit hereto entitled "Township of Pine Private Road Index and
Classification Schedule," the provisions of which are incorporated
herein by reference as if set forth at length in this section.
(2) Class B: those seven private roads identified as Class B on the
attached exhibit hereto entitled "Township of Pine Private Road
Index and Classification Schedule," the provisions of which are
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth at length in this
section.
(3) Class C: those 14 private roads identified as Class C on the
attached exhibit hereto entitled "Township of Pine Private Road
Index and Classification Schedule," the provisions of which are
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth at length in this
section.
(4) Class D: that one private road identified as Class D on the attached
exhibit hereto entitled "Township of Pine Private Road Index and
Classification Schedule," the provisions of which are incorporated
herein by reference as if set forth at length in this section.
B. Any additional private road which meets the requirements set forth in
Chapter 72 ("Streets and Sidewalks") of the Code of the Township of
Pine and which is later approved as such by any official action of the
Township's Board of Supervisors taken subsequent to the effective date
of this chapter shall be deemed to have been classified thereby as a
Class A private road, pursuant to § 65-3 hereof, unless some other
classification is specifically designated for it in formal action taken by
the Township's Board of Supervisors.
§ 65-3 PINE CODE § 65-6
62:252
§ 65-6. Evaluation for acceptance; petition required.
The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Pine may initiate the evaluation
of the possible future public acceptance of any existing private road
classified within Classes A, B, or C, as previously set forth herein, upon
the written petition signed by all owners of property representing more
than 50% of the number of properties abutting on such existing private
road proposed for public acceptance. In the event that a property does not
abut upon the existing private road proposed for public acceptance, but is
legally permitted to reach and utilize such private road and, also, does not
otherwise abut an existing public Township road, then such property shall
also be included in the calculation of the percentage of owners described
within this § 65-6.
§ 65-7. Preparation of plans and estimates.
Upon receipt of a written petition meeting the criteria as set forth in § 65-6
hereof, the Board of Supervisors may refer such matter to the Township
Engineer, Township staff, and Solicitor to prepare engineering plans and
estimates of the costs necessary to improve and upgrade the private road in
question to the specifications set forth for a private road of its classification
as designated in §§ 65-3 and 65-5 of this chapter.
§ 65-8. Establishment of assessments; Board of Viewers.
The method for establishing the assessments against owners of properties
abutting on and/or served by any private road which is to be the subject of
public acceptance shall be as follows:
A. Whenever the engineering plans and cost estimates for the proposed
improvement and construction of the private road to the appropriate
specifications set forth herein have been completed and approved by
the Township Engineer, the Board of Supervisors shall appoint a Board
of Viewers to establish the method (footage or benefit) by which each
property accommodated, improved, or benefitted by the construction of
the road improvements to the private road shall be assessed. Said
Board of Viewers shall consist of three members, all of whom shall be
residents of the Township. One member shall be a member of the
Township's Planning Commission, one member shall be a member of
the Township's Zoning Hearing Board, and one member shall hold no
other current elected or appointed position for the Township.
B. The Board of Viewers so appointed shall determine the method whereby
the properties accommodated, improved, or benefitted by the
construction of the road improvements to the private road shall be
assessed. The assessment method to be used in each instance shall be
confirmed in writing by the Board of Viewers and conveyed to the
Township Manager.
§ 65-6 MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS § 65-9
62:253
§ 65-9. Petition for public acceptance.
Upon receipt by the Township Manager of the information described in
§ 65-8 of this chapter, he/she shall convey to both the petitioning and
nonpetitioning property owners on the private road proposed for public
acceptance: the findings of the preliminary studies, the engineering
drawings, construction cost estimates, review of legal issues associated
with the proposed conversion, and methodology for cost assessment as
determined by the Board of Viewers. Upon consideration of this and any
other relevant information, the owners of property (as such is defined in
§ 65-6 of this chapter) abutting on or served by the private road in question
may file a written petition with the Board of Supervisors to undertake the
steps necessary to convert the private road to public ownership, subject to
the requirement that at least 2/3 of such owners of properties abutting and/
or serviced by the private road shall join in the written petition to the Board
of Supervisors to undertake its conversion to public ownership.
§ 65-10. Financial criteria for acceptance.
Upon the receipt of a written petition which meets the criteria as set
forth in § 65-9 hereof, the Board of Supervisors of the Township of Pine
shall determine if the Township's financial position permits it to undertake
an advancement of funds necessary for the improvement of the private
road for public acceptance and shall advise both the petitioners and the
nonpetitioning property owners in writing of such determination. The Board
of Supervisors shall have the absolute right to reject or to defer the
petitioners' request if, in the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, the
Township's financial position does not reasonably permit such advancement
of funds for construction.
§ 65-11. Additional conditions for acceptance.
The Board of Supervisors of the Township shall not accept any presently
existing private road unless all of the following conditions have been met:
A. Appropriate public right-of-way has been dedicated to the Township by
all necessary owners of property and they have provided written
approval to the Township for removal of trees, branches, or structures
in or projecting into the public right-of-way.
B. The private road's cartway, drainage, turnaround, and other required
features have been previously constructed (and the Township Engineer
has so certified in writing) to the appropriate specifications set herein.
C. The property owners have provided certifications to the Township that
all construction contractors have been fully paid or the appropriate
arrangements for assessment of property owners have been made as
set forth in §§ 65-12 and 65-13 hereof.
§ 65-9 PINE CODE § 65-12
62:254
§ 65-12. Final assessment.
The final assessment against owners of property abutting and/or benefitted
or serviced by the private road shall be made as follows:
§ 65-13. Payment of assessment.
All such above assessments shall be payable forthwith to the Township
Manager. Any owner of property so assessed shall have the additional
option of paying the assessment in equal, annual installments for not to
exceed a total of three years, with a maximum annual interest rate equal
to the then-prevailing legal rate of interest specified in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania (unless a lower rate of interest is specifically approved
therefor by the Township's Board of Supervisors), paid in the following
manner:
A. Whenever the final construction cost invoices have been received and
the Township Engineer has certified that the private road meets the
relevant construction and other standards necessary for public
acceptance (as set forth elsewhere in this chapter), the Board of
Viewers shall assess such construction costs against owners of property
abutting and/or benefitted or serviced by the private road, using the
methodology previously determined.
B. Upon the filing of the final report of the Board of Viewers with the
Board of Supervisors, assessment bills based upon the report of the
Board of Viewers shall be prepared by the Township and signed by the
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors and attested by the Secretary of
the Board of Supervisors.
C. The Township shall serve the assessment bills upon the owners of such
properties by certified mail, return receipt requested. If such owner or
owners cannot be found within the Township, said notice may be served
upon any agent or party in possession of the premises or posted on the
most public part of the assessed premises.
A. The first installment shall be paid within 30 days from receipt of the
assessment bill, and each of the remaining annual installments, with
interest thereon, shall be payable on the same day and month of each of
the succeeding years.
B. Any notice of intention by the owner or owners to exercise such
installment option shall be filed in writing with the Township Manager
no later than at the time of payment of the first such installment is due.
C. A municipal lien shall be duly filed by the Township of Pine, in
accordance with applicable law, against the affected properties and
owners for the amount of the remaining installments of the assessment,
which lien shall not be prosecuted so long as the installments are duly
paid in accordance with the following provisions: Upon default on the
payment of a current installment, a penalty of 5% shall be charged
against such installment; and upon default in the payment of more than
§ 65-12 MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS § 65-13
62:255
§ 65-14. Municipal lien.
If any owner has not elected to pay by installments and refuses or neglects
to pay such assessment within 30 days from receipt of the assessment bill,
the Township shall file a municipal lien, in accordance with applicable law,
against the affected properties and owner, also claiming interest thereon
at the then-prevailing legal rate of interest per annum specified in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (unless a lower rate of interest is
specifically approved therefor by the Township's Board of Supervisors) on
the unpaid balance from the date of such assessment bill. The Township
Manager shall certify to the Township Solicitor all unpaid assessments, and
the Township Solicitor shall file municipal claims against the property or
properties and owners or owners upon which such assessments shall have
been made. The Township Solicitor shall thereupon proceed to collect the
assessment under the general law relating to the collection of municipal
claims, including, if so directed by the Township, the filing and prosecution
of civil suits.
§ 65-15. Township costs for acceptance.
The Township of Pine shall pay (without the requirement of reimbursement
by or assessment of the property owners abutting on the private road) the
costs of engineering, legal, or other consulting services necessary to the
design and planning of the construction of the road improvements herein,
the cost of erection of any necessary signage, and the cost of reflection of
such change in circumstances upon the affected property owners' deed.
§ 65-16. Deviation from regulations prohibited.
The procedures and specifications set forth herein shall be the sole manner
in which the Township shall consider acceptance of the herein-named
existing private roads as public Township roads, and no deviation herefrom

§ 66-2. Right-of-way permit required.
§ 66-3. Application for right-of-way permit.
A. No person shall enter upon or occupy any right-of-way for the purpose
of installing, constructing, maintaining or operating a
telecommunications system without first having obtained a right-of-way
permit. Any person maintaining or operating a telecommunications
system as of the effective date of this chapter shall also obtain a rightof-
way permit.
B. Before a right-of-way permit is issued, the holder of or applicant for a
right-of-way permit shall have applied for any and all regulatory
approvals, permits or authorizations from the appropriate federal and
state and local authorities, if required. Upon the request of the
Township, the applicant shall submit written evidence of its
applications for or receipt of all such approvals, permits or
authorizations.
C. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as a waiver of any ordinances
or regulations of the Township or of the Township's right to require
prospective or current right-of-way permit holders to secure and remit
payment for any and all required permits or authorizations.
A. A right-of-way permit shall only be granted after an applicant has
completed an application in the form that has been prescribed by the
Township, which form may be revised from time to time. Upon request,
an applicant shall be provided with a copy of the then current
application for a right-of-way permit. The application shall request
information regarding the applicant's proposed or actual physical use
and occupation of the rights-of-way. Specifically, the application shall

§ 66-4. Duration and suspension of right-of-way permit.
request: a brief description of the telecommunications service or
services to be offered or provided in or through the Township; specific
information regarding the equipment it proposes to place or currently
maintains in the rights-of-way; the expected physical burden that such
equipment will place or does place on the rights-of-way; and whether
the equipment will or does have a detrimental effect on public safety
as it relates to the rights-of-way. If the completed application does not
fully provide such requested information, the Township may request
such additional information as is necessary to enable it to make a
determination regarding the physical use and occupation of the rightsof-
way by the applicant. The application may request less information
from a permit holder applying for a renewal of a right-of-way permit.
B. Upon submission of a fully completed application to the Township and
the accompanying fee, the Township shall review the application as
follows: for new applicants, the Township shall grant or deny such
applications within 45 days. For existing permit holders applying for a
renewal of their permits, who are not under suspension in accordance
with § 66-4 below, the Township shall grant or deny such applications
within 10 business days. If the Township fails to grant or reject such
application within the time periods specified above, the application
shall be deemed approved. In each case, the Township shall review the
application to determine whether such use would have a detrimental
effect on public safety as it relates to the rights-of-way or would place
an undue physical burden on the rights-of-way.
C. In considering an application, the Township may use such outside
experts as it deems necessary. In the event that the Township deems it
necessary to employ an outside expert to advise the Township with
respect to a particular application, the reasonable costs of such expert
shall be borne by the applicant.
A. Right-of-way permits shall have an initial duration period of one year
from their date of issuance. Permit holders may apply for a renewal of a
right-of-way permit prior to its expiration. The Township may suspend
such right-of-way permit in the event that any one or more of the
following has occurred:
(1) The permit holder shall have caused damage to Township property
or the right-of-way without the prior consent of the Township
(except such prior consent shall not be required in the case of an
emergency) and without completing proper restoration.
(2) The permit holder or the permit holder's equipment in the right-ofway
has had a detrimental effect on public safety as it relates to the
rights-of-way.
(3) The permit holder failed to pay any of the fees required under this
chapter.
§ 66-3 PINE CODE § 66-4
66:264
§ 66-5. Construction permit required.
§ 66-6. Fees and expenses.
(4) The permit holder failed to comply with construction standards in
accordance with the provisions contained in § 66-8 below.
(5) The permit holder failed to indemnify, hold harmless and insure the
Township in accordance with the provisions contained in § 66-9
below.
B. If the Township has reason to believe that one or more of the above
events has occurred, it shall notify the permit holder in writing. The
permit holder shall have 30 days to cure the violation, unless the
Township reasonably determines that the event is an emergency, in
which case the Township may impose a shorter time period to cure the
violation.
C. If the permit holder fails to cure the violation within the specified time
period, the Township shall be permitted to immediately suspend the
right-of-way permit. A suspension shall be brought to the attention of
the Township's Board of Supervisors at its next public meeting, at which
time the Township's Board of Supervisors shall be permitted to uphold
or withdraw the suspension. The permit holder shall be provided an
opportunity to be heard at such meeting.
A. Except in the case of an emergency, before commencing any
construction in the rights-of-way, a person shall submit to the Township
detailed plans of the proposed construction activity. Such plans shall
include the type of construction activity, the equipment proposed to be
installed or erected, the specific locations of the construction activity
and the scheduled beginning and ending dates of all planned
construction. Such plans shall also include the name(s), address(es) and
experience of any and all subcontractors whom applicant intends to
utilize. Such information may be submitted concurrently with an
application for a right-of-way permit.
B. Upon submission of all such information required in Subsection A
above, the Township shall review such information and either grant or
deny a construction permit within 45 days. If the Township fails to grant
or deny the construction permit within such time period, the permit
shall be deemed granted. In each such case, the Township shall review
the information provided herein to determine whether such
construction would have a detrimental impact on public safety as it
relates to the rights-of-way. The Township may impose conditions on the
Construction permit regulating the times, locations and manner of
construction to preserve effective traffic flow, prevent hazardous road
conditions and/or minimize noise impacts.
A. Each new applicant for a right-of-way permit shall include with its
application an application fee in the amount of $500. This fee is directly
§ 66-4 RIGHTS-OF-WAY § 66-6
66:265
related to the Township's costs in reviewing the application (excluding
expert costs) and managing the rights-of-way with respect to each
permit holder. Such costs in managing the rights-of-way include, but
are not limited to, inspection costs, administrative costs, costs of
maintaining the rights-of-way and costs of degradation of streets and
right-of-way property. This fee will not be refunded in the event that
the application is denied. If the application is granted, the application
fee will apply to the full term of the right-of-way permit of one year. If
the applicant applies for a construction permit concurrently with the
application for a right-of-way permit, then the application fee contained
herein shall apply to both the right-of-way permit and the construction
permit.
B. Each existing permit holder applying for a renewal of its right-of-way
permit shall include with its application an annual fee in the amount of
$300. This fee is directly related to the Township's costs in managing
the rights-of-way with respect to each permit holder. Such costs
include, but are not limited to, inspection costs, administrative costs,
costs of maintaining the rights-of-way and costs of degradation of
streets and right-of-way property.
C. Each applicant for a construction permit shall include with its
application an application fee in the amount of $200. This fee is directly
related to the Township's costs in reviewing the application and
determining time, place and manner restrictions on the construction
activity. If the application for a construction permit is denied, this fee
shall not be refunded. If the application is granted, then the applicant
shall pay, within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, the
Township's actual costs based on the rate established by resolution of
the Township's Board of Supervisors. Such actual costs include, but are
not limited to, costs of disruption and rerouting of traffic, inspection
costs and administrative costs.
D. Extraordinary expenses. In addition to the fees set forth above, a permit
holder shall pay, within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, any
extraordinary or unusual expenses reasonably incurred by the
Township as a result of the permit holder's use of the rights-of-way,
provided that the Township notifies the permit holder of the expected
expenses prior to them being incurred and provides the permit holder
with an opportunity to mitigate such expenses. Examples of
extraordinary or unusual costs include, but are not limited to, the cost
of obtaining and operating a backhoe, dump truck or other heavy
equipment used to repair the right-of-way, pay (including overtime or
special pay) for police officers, personnel to direct or route traffic or
other emergency services. The statement of such expenses presented to
the permit holder shall be directly related to the Township's actual
costs.
E. In the event that payment of any of the fees or expenses identified
above is not made upon submission of the application or by the date
due, the applicant or permit holder shall pay a late payment penalty of

past due. Such penalty shall be in lieu of any other monetary penalty.
Acceptance of payment under this section shall not in any way limit
or waive the Township's right to suspend or terminate the permit
according to the terms of this chapter.
A. The Township shall have the right to limit the placement of new or
additional equipment in the right-of-way if it determines, in the exercise
of its reasonable discretion, that there is insufficient space to
reasonably accommodate all requests to occupy and use the rights-ofway.
The Township shall consider requests for occupying and using the
rights-of-way in the order of receipt of fully completed applications for
right-of-way permits. The Township shall strive, to the extent possible,
to accommodate all reasonable requests, but shall be guided by the
physical condition of the right-of-way and whether such use would have
a detrimental effect on public safety as it relates to the right-of-way.
B. The Township shall have the right to monitor the telecommunications
systems and the equipment related thereto located in the rights-of-way
in order to prevent interference between and among such systems and
equipment.

part of the permit holder's telecommunications system located in the
rights-of-way at any time upon three days' notice or, in case of an
emergency, upon demand. Costs or expenses incurred by the Township
in such inspections shall be paid by the permit holder to the Township
within 30 days of the presentation of a statement therefor.
A. Whenever a permit holder or any of its subcontractors shall disturb any
pavement, sidewalk or other public property in order to perform any

construction activity in a manner consistent and in compliance with the
detailed plans it submitted to the Township and all applicable federal,
state and local laws and regulations.

harmless the Township, its elected and appointed officials, employees
and agents, at all times against any and all claims for personal injury,

use or occupancy of the rights-of-way. A permit holder shall defend any
actions or proceedings against the Township in which it is claimed that
personal injury, including death, or property damage was caused by the
permit holder's use or occupancy of the rights-of-way. The obligation to
indemnify, hold harmless and defend shall include, but not be limited to,
the obligation to pay judgments, injuries, liabilities, damages,
attorneys' fees, reasonable expert fees, court costs and all other costs of
indemnification. A permit holder shall not be required to indemnify and
hold the Township harmless for claims caused by the Township's
negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

require its subcontractors to carry liability, property damage, worker's

faith as such prior to the time it is provided to the Township.

[Adopted 12-7-1987 by Res. No. 309]
§ 68-10. Intent. [Amended 12-21-1988 by Ord. No. 173]
§ 68-11. Developer to file preliminary letter of request.
As the first step toward obtaining the Township's approval of extending or
constructing sewer service to any location within the Township's service
area, the developer or his representative must file a letter requesting the
same in which a general description of the proposed improvements is
included, along with a photocopy of a map on which the property to be
developed is superimposed. Such information need not be technical nor
detailed but should be sufficiently clear to illustrate what is proposed to be
constructed and where.
§ 68-12. Preapplication conference.
The Township will respond to the developer's preliminary letter for the
purpose of establishing a date and a time mutually agreeable for a
preapplication conference, to be held in the Township's office. The purpose
of the conference will be for the developer to elaborate upon the proposed
project and for the Township's representatives to elaborate upon its
requirements relative to the sewer work expected to be performed. The
developer shall have its engineer in attendance at the conference so that the
Township's representatives may communicate directly with him concerning
A. This article is intended to provide guidance and to assist prospective
developers in the Township of Pine which desire connection to,
extension to or construction of a separate sanitary collecting sewer
system. The details of construction of those facilities which are
proposed to be designed and constructed within streets and other
public rights-of-way and, upon proper completion, will be conveyed to
the Township for operation and maintenance are set forth in the current
Specifications for the Construction of Sanitary Sewer Pipe Lines and
Appurtenances, copies of which are available for inspection and review
in the Pine Township Municipal Building during normal business hours.
This, then, addresses notifications, payment of fees, certain
engineering requirements, scheduling of construction work, surety
requirements, inspections and other administrative procedures
necessary to obtain the Township's approval as the work commences,
progresses and is completed.

appurtenances.
A. The Township may approve the design and construction of wastewater
treatment plants, pump stations or force mains by the developer, or the
Township will design and construct wastewater treatment plants,
pumping stations and force mains. The allocated cost of the same to the
developer will be disclosed by the Township to the developer after
receipt of construction bids and prior to commencement of
construction. In general, if such facilities serve only the respective
proposed development, the developer will be responsible for the total
costs of construction, engineering and inspection incurred by the
Township; if, on the other hand, such facilities are determined by the
Township to benefit the Township and/or others, the Township will
allocate such costs and benefits and will negotiate an agreement with
the developer before approval of the plans for the project.
B. All plans, profiles and details shall be prepared on tracing film 24
inches by 36 inches in size.
C. All pipeline plans shall be prepared at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet;
all profiles shall be prepared at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet

details shall be agreed upon prior to commencement of design. General
location maps/plans shall be prepared on a scale of one inch equals 400
feet.
D. All plans shall show property lines, rights-of-way, lot layouts, creeks,
streams, existing buildings, existing utility lines and other topographic
features.
E. A brief narrative report shall be prepared identifying sewage loadings
and all characteristics of flows which are nondomestic and providing all
technical information required for any industrial, commercial or
institutional user and for the ultimate attainment of approval of any
relevant regulatory agencies. A wastewater contribution permit, the
requirements relative to which are described within the Rules and
Regulations Governing Use of the Sewer System, must be applied for
and obtained by all system users anticipating the contribution of any
nondomestic wastewater.
F. Following the date of receipt of all properly prepared plans, profiles,
details, the narrative report and other filings, the Township will review,
comment upon, approve, reject or return said submittals within 21
calendar days.

B. All property owners within the sanitary sewer district shall be
thereafter assessed by the Township of Pine for all such costs and
expenses previously paid by the Township in connection therewith by
the use of one of the two following methods:
(1) By proportion of a property's frontage abutting on the main
sanitary sewer line (allowing for an equitable reduction for corner
properties or those that are unusually shaped); or
(2) By an equal assessment on all properties abutting on the main
sanitary sewer line in proportion to the total costs and expenses
paid by the Township of Pine.
C. Any owner of property so assessed by the Township of Pine shall have
the choice, within 60 days from receipt of the assessment bill, of
thereafter paying the assessment immediately in full or, alternatively,
by payment in five equal, annual installments with interest applied at
the rate of 6% per annum.
D. A municipal lien shall be filed by the Township of Pine against all
properties within the sanitary sewer district for which the assessments
are not immediately paid in full in the amount of said assessment.
E. Any additional costs attributable solely to providing sanitary sewer
service to individual properties (i.e., service line, service connection
fee, etc.) will be paid directly by the property owner and shall not be the
responsibility of the Township of Pine.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
§ 71-1. Statement of findings.
Drawing No. Name
Created or last

PR-12 Recreation Detail December 2008
B. Copies of such documents and drawings, in their entirety, are attached
hereto and incorporated herein in their entirety.69
A. The stormwater management needs of the Township of Pine have been
studied and identified through field investigations, citizen notifications,
engineering studies, and related planning activities, indicating that
more comprehensive and effective stormwater management in the
Township will contribute to the protection of health, safety and welfare
of its residents, and, also, the stormwater facilities, infrastructure and
activities associated with stormwater management shall provide
benefits to all properties, property owners, residents, visitors and
citizens of the Township of Pine.
B. Inadequate management of stormwater runoff through a watershed can
increase and accelerate flows and velocities, contribute to erosion and
sediment, overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm
sewers, greatly increase the cost of public activities and public facilities
to effectively convey and manage stormwater, undermine floodplain
management and flood reduction efforts in downstream communities,
reduce groundwater recharge, negatively impact other related water
resource needs and threaten public health and safety.
C. Inadequate management of stormwater runoff throughout a watershed
can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows, increasing erosion and
sedimentation, destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic
69.Editor's Note: Said copies are on file in the Township offices and may be examined there
during regular office hours.
§ 70-1 PINE CODE § 71-1
68:288
pollution concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals and pathogens.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which supports
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams.
E. A comprehensive program of public and private stormwater
management (utilizing both public and private facilities) which seeks to
avoid and minimize flooding, erosion, and water quality degradation is
fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of
the Township of Pine, local properties, and the environment of the
Township of Pine and also of its neighboring communities.
F. In order to establish, construct, operate, enhance and maintain
stormwater management facilities, systems, and management plans;
ensure the continued effective operation of the system through
installation and management of best management practices (BMPs);
and provide other services such as appropriate inspections, asset
management, and regulatory oversight associated with stormwater and
watershed management, sufficient and stable funding is required to
support these public services.
G. Multiple federal regulations, including those found at 40 CFR Part 122,
and also Pennsylvania state regulations, require the Township of Pine to
implement and fund a program of stormwater management, which

Township of Pine's regulated stormwater outfalls to local water bodies.
In accordance with these regulations, the Township of Pine has a permit
to manage stormwater discharges from its municipal separate storm
sewer systems ("MS4s") under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") regulations.
H. The Township of Pine Board of Supervisors has developed a program to
establish fair, reasonable and equitable uniform fees so that property
owners within a stormwater management district (except those owning
properties that have been predetermined to already have appropriate
and adequate installation and maintenance, in accordance with best
management practices, of stormwater management facilities or those
properties that have been determined to be tax exempt) will pay an
equitable share of the costs of operation, maintenance, repair,
inspection, regulatory compliance, administration, replacement and
construction of improvements related to the stormwater management
facilities, stormwater management systems, management plans and
related services provided or paid for by the Township of Pine.
I. The proposed program for creating the stormwater management
district and imposing the fees established herein has received input and
comment from the public through its review at publicly advertised
public meetings of the Township of Pine's Board of Supervisors
(including on October 20, 2017) and has been the subject of a specific
public hearing held upon this chapter (and duly advertised by required

B. Copies of the pertinent portions of the above-referenced plans are
attached hereto as exhibits (and incorporated herein by reference). A
further description of individual properties within the above-described
Stormwater Management District has been prepared by the Township
Manager and a listing of same is and shall be maintained in the offices
of the Township of Pine, 230 Pearce Mill Road, Wexford, PA 15090 (and
the provisions of same are hereby incorporated by reference).
A. The fee shall initially be set at a flat rate of $100 per taxable property
where maintenance and operation of a stormwater management facility
is of multiple property owners (such as, but not limited to, a
homeowners' association or separate property owners within a
subdivision or land development plan where a viable homeowners'
association has not been created).
B. The fee credit shall be initially set at a flat rate credit of $100 per
taxable property where a stormwater management facility is the
responsibility of multiple property owners and such stormwater
management facility has been adequately maintained by such property
owners, as determined following inspection and certification by the
Township of Pine.
§ 71-3 SEWERS § 71-4
68:293
§ 71-5. Uniform application of fees.
The fee provided herein shall be uniformly assessed, liened and collected

property's real estate taxes, unless exempted.
§ 71-6. "User" and "owner" distinguished.
References in this chapter to "use," "user," "lot," "parcel," with respect to
the assessment of fees shall not be construed to modify or alter the fact that
the fees authorized by this chapter shall be assessed to the owner(s) of each
separate property or parcel, and such owner(s) shall be and remain liable
for payment of same, whether or not such owner occupies the property
and therefore directly uses the stormwater management facilities and
stormwater management system. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to prohibit the owner's ability to collect by lease or contract equivalent
sums due from a tenant or other occupier of the owner's property, but such
lease or contract shall not bind the Township of Pine or limit in any way its
authority to impose, assess, and collect the fees specified herein from the
owner(s) of the property and to lien a property regulated hereby.
§ 71-7. Billing and collection of fees.
C. When a group of multiple property owners either assumes
responsibility for operation and maintenance of stormwater
management facilities (when they did not so previously) or no longer
performs or accepts responsibility for operation and maintenance of
stormwater management facilities (when they did so previously) such
changes shall be authorized by official action of the Township of Pine
Board of Supervisors at a public meeting.
D. When a group of multiple property owners requests to accept
responsibility for operation and maintenance of stormwater
management facilities (which was previously not so performed) the fee
provided herein shall continue to be charged, without credit, as
otherwise specified herein, for a period of three additional years after
official action of the Township of Pine Board of Supervisors, after which
time the credit specified herein shall become applicable.
A. The fee(s) fixed and established by this chapter shall be applicable,
beginning in calendar year 2018 and annually thereafter as to all
properties that use, are served, or are benefited by the stormwater
management system existing as of the effective date of this chapter, and
shall thereafter be applicable and effective to all other properties that
begin to use, be served or be benefitted by the stormwater management
system. Fees imposed by this chapter shall be assessed annually and
added as a line item to the annual Township real estate tax bill and shall
be due and payable by property owners using the same procedure and
timeline for same. The fees assessed and collected will not be subject to
proration or refund by the Township of Pine in the event that a property
§ 71-4 PINE CODE § 71-7
68:294
§ 71-8. Stormwater management fees constitute lien on property.
In accordance with Section 1612 of the Second Class Township Code and
the Municipal Claims Act, 53 P.S. § 7101 et seq., as amended, all fees,
penalties, interest (at the permitted legal rate upon the unpaid balance
after its due date), collection fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
lien filing and satisfaction fees and other charges imposed for failure to pay
promptly the fees assessed by this chapter, shall constitute a lien upon and
against the subject property and its owner from the date of their imposition
and assessment.

§ 71-10. Stormwater Revenue Account.
All fees and other stormwater-related revenue authorized to be imposed,
assessed, and collected by this chapter shall be deposited in the Township
of Pine Stormwater Revenue Account, a separate account dedicated to
the operation, administration, maintenance, repair and improvement of

(P.L. 439), be used only for the purposes authorized thereby.
is sold; provided, however, that a buyer and seller of property shall
not be precluded hereby from making their own private, contractual
agreement to provide for proration of credit between them of any fees
associated herewith.
B. The Township of Pine Board of Supervisors may review and update the
fees fixed and established by this chapter by a subsequent resolution, as
may be deemed necessary from time to time, and as adopted by
resolution at a properly advertised meeting.
A. Credits for fees otherwise imposed hereby will be provided when
property owner(s) have specifically requested such credit and the
required maintenance or repairs are performed in accordance with
Township directives on a timely basis and such stormwater facilities are
current and in accordance with acceptable standards (all as determined
by the Township in its reasonable discretion). Additionally, to qualify for
such credit, the property owner(s) shall be required to have executed a
standard operation and maintenance plan agreement (in a form
acceptable to the Township of Pine) which shall be recorded in the
Allegheny County Department of Real Estate acknowledging the
owner(s)' ongoing maintenance requirements.
B. Any owner (or group of owners) who believes its fees have been
calculated in error may appeal such calculation to the Township of
Pine's Board of Supervisors, with such appeal to be heard promptly
thereafter at a public meeting.

68:295
§ 71-11. Floods and liability.
Flooding may occur occasionally due to stormwater volume that exceeds
the capacity of the Township of Pine's stormwater management system.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to imply that properties within
the Township of Pine, including but not limited to those subject to the fees
imposed hereby, shall always be free from flooding or flood damage, or
that all flood control projects to control stormwater can provide complete
protection from all flood and storm events. Nothing whatsoever in this
chapter shall deem the Township of Pine liable for any injuries or damages
incurred, either directly or indirectly, from stormwater or from adverse
water quality. Nothing in this chapter purports to reduce the need,
appropriateness, or necessity for flood insurance to be separately
maintained by owners of properties, and the Township of Pine expressly
reserves its right to assert all available legal immunities and defenses in
any civil action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the Township of
Pine, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure
of or negligence or breach of duty regarding the stormwater management
system.
§ 71-12. Authorization to implement and enforce terms of this
chapter.
The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Pine is hereby authorized to do
all acts (including authorization to delegate same to its authorized Township
management staff, Township Solicitor, and other duly authorized agents)
necessary to carry out the terms of this chapter, including but not limited
to performance of necessary ongoing repairs, maintenance, or management
associated with stormwater management functions within the Township of
Pine's Stormwater Management District and, also, the collection of the
related fees and costs established hereby.
§ 71-13. Severability.
If any section, paragraph, subsection, clause or provision of this chapter
shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as
a whole or any part thereof other than that portion specifically declared
invalid.

one-fourth-inch edging tool to make a uniform finished surface. The
concrete shall be cured with either an application of an approved curing
compound or covered with a polyethylene sheet covering.
G. Backfilling. After the concrete has been cured for at least 72 hours, the

§ 72-58 SEWERS § 72-59
68:321
§ 72-59. Specifications for curb construction.
The construction or reconstruction of curbs shall be in accordance with the
specifications and in conformity to the lines and grades established by the
Township Engineer.
A. Concrete. The curb shall be made of cement concrete and shall be of
the proportion and mix as specified in § 72-57D of this article.
B. Forms. Forms for the curb shall be of metal, except that wood forms
may be used on sharp curves and short tangent sections when approved
in writing by the Township Engineer. Forms shall be straight, free from
warp and of sufficient strength when staked to resist the pressure of the
concrete without springing. At least three stakes shall be placed for
each 10 feet of form. Metal forms shall be of approved section and shall
have a flat surface on top, and wood forms, when authorized, shall be
nominal two-inch surface planks. These forms shall be of a depth equal
to the depth of the curb, designed to permit secure fastening of the face
and back forms at the tops. These fastenings shall be constructed in a
manner that will not obstruct satisfactory finishing and edging of the
top of the curb but will permit removal of the inside or face forms. All
forms and templates shall be thoroughly cleaned and treated with an
approved material as required, to prevent the concrete from adhering
thereto. Oil, bituminous paper or other material which will adhere to or
discolor the concrete shall not be used. Forms and templates which are
worn, bent, warped or broken shall not be used. The forms shall be
accurately set to line and grade in a manner to prevent settlement or
displacement.
C. Excavation. Excavation shall be made to the depth as required in
§ 72-58D of this article, and the material upon which the curb is to be
constructed shall be compacted to a firm, even surface.
D. Placing and finishing concrete. The concrete shall be placed in the
forms, and horizontal layers are not to exceed five inches and spaded
sufficiently to eliminate all voids. An approved vibrator may be used
when permitted by the Township Engineer. When indicated or directed,
drainage openings shall be made through the curb at the elevation of
the size required. The curb shall be depressed as indicated or directed.
The top surface of the curb shall be finished true to line and grade in a
smooth, neat and even manner by means of wood floats, and the edges
of the face and back shall be rounded to a radius of not more than 3/4 of
an inch and 1/4 of an inch, respectively, while the concrete is still
plastic. The finished curb shall have a surface free from voids and
honeycomb. Any additional surface finishing required shall be
performed immediately after extrusion.
E. Joints and bar dowels. The curb shall be constructed in uniform lengths
or sections of 20 feet, except where shorter sections are necessary for
closures or curves, but no section shall be less than four feet. Joints
shall be placed between sections of the curb at intervals of not more
§ 72-59 PINE CODE § 72-59
68:322
than 20 feet. These joints shall be at least 1/4 of an inch and shall be
filled with prepared strips of fiber matrix and bitumen at least 1/4 of an
inch in thickness, cut to conform to the cross section of said curb. When
a curved curb joins with a tangent curb, at curb returns and on sharp
curbs where directed, there shall be imbedded in the concrete two bar
dowels No. 4 size and 24 inches in length. The bar shall be placed
three and 12 inches, respectively, below the top of the curb and in the
center of its width and shall extend 12 inches into the curb on each
side of the joint. The portions of the bars extending into the tangent
curb shall be rendered bondless with a coating of approved material
and enclosed, in part, in an approved tube or caps which will provide a
positive clearance pocket of at least 1/2 inch.
F. Removal of forms. When the concrete has set sufficiently, the forms
shall be removed. All joints in the curb shall be opened from top to
bottom immediately after the forms are removed, and the edges
adjacent to the joints shall be sharp and clean-cut. After the forms are
removed, minor defects shall be filled with mortar composed of one part
of cement and two parts of fine aggregate.
G. Curing. The curb shall be cured with either an application of an
approved curing compound or covered with a polyethylene sheet
covering and sealed completely on both sides of the curb by weights for
a period of three days.
H. Backfilling. After the concrete has sufficiently set, the spaces in front
and back of the curb shall be backfilled with approved materials in
layers of not more than six inches in depth. The material shall be
thoroughly compacted in layers of not more than six inches.
I. Dimensions. Concrete curb and wedge curb shall have the dimensions
as set forth on a drawing prepared by the Township Engineer showing
standard dimensions. This drawing shall be available for inspection at
the Pine Township Municipal Building.
J. Depressed curb. Depressed curb shall be required in all such locations
and instances where the Township Engineer shall determine that its use
is appropriate and warranted. Dimensions for depressed curb shall be
as set forth on a drawing prepared by the Township Engineer showing
standard dimensions for same. This drawing shall be available for
inspection at the Pine Township Municipal Building.
K. Curb returns.
(1) Curb returns for alleys and streets shall be provided as follows:
(a) Alleys 20 to 30 feet wide: 6.0 feet radius.
(b) Streets 40 to 50 feet wide: 12.0 feet radius.
(c) Streets 60 to 80 feet wide: 15.0 feet radius.
(2) Depressed curb shall be confined between expansion joints.
§ 72-59 SEWERS § 72-60
68:323
§ 72-60. Replacement of curbs.
When it is necessary to replace an existing standard curb with a depressed
curb at a driveway or to replace a depressed curb, the section of standard
curb or depressed curb to be replaced, as the case may be, shall be removed
by means of a masonry saw, resulting in a smooth, vertical cut to the entire
depth of the curb. The depressed section to be installed shall be poured
to the full length as required for standard curb, less the allowance for the
depression, as set forth in this article. Expansion joints as specified in this
article shall be placed between the new and remaining curb sections.
§ 72-61. Deviations from regulations.
Any deviation from the regulations set forth in this article are subject to the
written approval of the Township Engineer or the Township Supervisors.
§ 72-62. Permit; application.
§ 72-63. Fees.
The fee for such permit shall be set by resolution of the Township
Supervisors, which fee schedule shall be posted for public inspection in the
office of the Township Manager and shall be based on cost. When sidewalks
or curbs are constructed or reconstructed simultaneously, only one permit
and fee shall be required.
§ 72-64. Violations and penalties.
A. Before constructing or reconstructing any curb or sidewalk, it shall be
the duty of all owners of real estate, contractors, subcontractors,
mechanics and laborers to secure the necessary permit and line and
grade from the Township, authorizing the requested construction or
reconstruction.
B. It shall be the duty of every owner of real estate, previous to the
construction or reconstruction of curbing or sidewalks, footways or
gutters on any street or alley in the Township, to make application for a
permit to the Township in order to fix the line and grade for the
construction or reconstruction of curbing, sidewalk or gutters. Such
permit, when duly issued by the Township, shall be sufficient authority
for such owner or his contractor, subcontractor, mechanic or laborer to
commence and complete along such lot or ground as may be described
in such permit and in accordance with the regulations, rules and
specifications fixed and established by this article, and none other, to
construct or reconstruct sidewalks or gutters for which such permit has
been granted. Grade stakes and offset stakes must be approved by the
Township Engineer at the time of issuance of the permit. The Township
will be given five days' notice prior to the date said owner wishes to
commence construction so that there will be sufficient time to place the
construction stakes.
§ 72-60 PINE CODE § 72-64
68:324
A. If any sidewalk or curb thereafter constructed or reconstructed is not
constructed or reconstructed in conformity to the lines and grades
established by the Township Engineer, it shall be the duty of the person
laying the same, upon notice from the Township Engineer or Township
Manager, so to alter and construct the same as to conform to the official
lines and grades. Failure within five days after such notice to comply
with said notice and the requirements of this article shall be a violation
of this article, and each day's neglect and refusal to comply with the
terms of said notice shall constitute a separate offense.
B. Any person, whether as principal, agent or employee, violating or
assisting in violation of any of the provisions of this article shall, upon
conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding $300 and
costs of suit and, in default of payment of fine and costs, to undergo
imprisonment for not more than 30 days.

ARTICLE VIII
Sidewalk Maintenance
[Adopted 4-3-2006 by Ord. No. 333]
§ 72-65. Definitions.
The term "sidewalk," as used in this article, means and includes all paved
pedestrian pathways situated within public street rights-of-way and
abutting private or public property located within the Township of Pine.
§ 72-66. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to insure that sidewalks are adequately
maintained and kept in a state of good repair in order to reduce or
otherwise eliminate any condition that would constitute a hazard to or
result in possible injuries to the pedestrian public.
§ 72-67. Duty of property owner.
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the abutting property to
keep the sidewalk immediately in front of his/her/its property in good
order and repair, and at all times free and clear of all obstruction to safe
and convenient passage. This shall include keeping and maintaining such
sidewalks free and clear of all dirt, trash and similar debris, including the
removal of snow and ice and unauthorized structure or appurtenance.
§ 72-68. Notice of violation; noncompliance; cost recovery.
In the event a property owner fails to properly maintain the sidewalk
abutting his property in accordance with § 72-67 of this article, a notice of
violation shall be issued by the Township and sent to the property owner
by registered or certified mail. The property owner shall take the steps
necessary to correct such violation(s) within a reasonable period of time,
but in no case shall any violation remain uncorrected for a period of more
than 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of violation. Failure
to comply shall subject the property owner to the penalties contained in
§ 72-71 of this article. If the property owner continues to fail to comply
with such notice, the government unit with control over the street (whether
in fee or by easement) may make the necessary repairs, remove any
obstructions or eliminate any hazard to pedestrian safety. In the event that
the government unit making the repairs is not the Township, the Township
may reimburse that government unit for the cost of the same. When the
Township has incurred the costs or reimbursed another government unit for
such costs, those costs, together with a penalty of 10%, shall be paid by
the delinquent property owner and be collected by an action of assumpsit,
or the Township Board of Supervisors may file a municipal lien against the
property.

§ 72-65 SEWERS § 72-69
68:327
§ 72-70. Intergovernmental cooperation.
§ 72-71. Violations and penalties.

shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $300.
A. Installation, repair or replacement of sidewalks or sections thereof
along Township roads shall be in accordance with current Township
specifications for same, or as such may be amended in the future. These
specifications shall be made available to the property owner to insure
that the proper requirements are met.
B. Sidewalks installed along county or state roads shall meet the
specifications established by the county or state.
A. The Township may, at its sole discretion, enter into sidewalk
agreements with other government units owning streets within the
Township to provide for enforcement of the provisions of this article
against property owners with sidewalks abutting or contained within
such streets. Such agreements may obligate the Township to reimburse
such government unit for any costs it incurs in making the necessary
repairs, removing any obstructions or eliminating any hazard to
pedestrian safety in regards to sidewalks.
B. Any agreements entered into by the Township pursuant to the
authorization set forth in this article shall be approved by resolution of
the Township Board of Supervisors and shall be in a form approved by
the Solicitor.
C. No sidewalk agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall
constitute a waiver of the Township's governmental immunity for any
reason whatsoever. [Amended 5-5-2008 by Ord. No. 344]

same are amended and may be amended in the future.
§ 78-42 SEWERS § 78-44
68:433
(2) Where not shown on the Comprehensive Plan or Zoning District
Map, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall
conform to the provisions found herein.
(3) Every subdivision and land development shall have access to a
public street.
B. Street layout.
(1) In general, all streets shall be continuous and in alignment with
existing streets and shall compose a convenient system to ensure
circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with the exception
that minor local streets may be laid out so that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
(2) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
interstate, arterial (principal or minor) or collector street, the
governing body shall require marginal access streets in order to
protect residential areas from heavy traffic and also to provide
separation between local and through traffic.
(3) Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
(4) New half or partial streets will not be permitted. Wherever a tract
to be subdivided or developed borders an existing half or partial
street, the other part of the street shall be platted within such tract
at required widths.
(5) Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit
future street extension into adjoining tracts or when designated as
culs-de-sac. The length of any cul-de-sac street shall be no longer
than the length needed to accommodate a maximum of 50 dwelling
units or a maximum of 4,000 feet, whichever shall be less. The
length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the nearest
edge of the pavement of the nearest intersecting street (which is
not itself a cul-de-sac street) to the center of the circle forming the
cul-de-sac. The turnaround of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum
radius to the outside edge of the paving or curb of 60 feet and a
right-of-way having a minimum radius of 75 feet. Such cul-de-sac
may include a planting area so long as the paved portion of the culde-
sac maintains a minimum width of 24 feet. [Amended
11-16-2009 by Ord. No. 352]
(6) Where adjoining areas are not subdivided or developed, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions
for the proper projection of streets. Where a new subdivision
adjoins undeveloped or unsubdivided land susceptible to being
subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries
of the tract proposed to be subdivided or developed.
§ 78-44 PINE CODE § 78-44
68:434
(7) Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. Intersections of more than two streets shall be avoided.
Where this proves impossible, such intersections shall be designed
with care for safety, and suitable curbs, barriers, signs and other
devices may be required. Streets entering opposite sides of another
street shall be laid out directly opposite one another.
(8) Where new developments are adjacent to a development where
streets are carried to or proposed to be carried to any of the
boundaries that abut the parcel to be developed, then the streets
within the new development shall be extended to or connected to
the street location or street in the adjacent development.
(9) Street and driveway intersections with arterial (principal or minor)
or collector streets shall not be so numerous nor so close to each
other as to impede the flow of traffic on such arterial street or as to
create a safety hazard on such arterial or collector street.

are made for adequate service access or for parking.
D. Minimum street grade. No street shall have a grade less than 1%.
E. Horizontal and vertical curve design.
(1) Vertical curves should be designed to provide minimum stopping
and sight distances and comfort to the driver and be pleasing in
appearance. The minimum length of a vertical curve is given by the
following formula:
L =KA
Where:
L =The length of the vertical curve in feet.
A =The algebraic difference between the rates of grade
expressed in percent.
K =The horizontal distance in feet required to effect a onepercent
change in gradient.
(2) Minimum values of K are as follows:

Board of Supervisors shall not approve any final plat unless all abutting
minor local, collector and arterial (principal or minor) streets shown
thereon and all minor local, collector and arterial (principal or minor)
streets which provide transportation access to or may be utilized, in
whole or in part, by traffic generated from such proposed development
presently meet the minimum level of service incorporated herein as the
Township of Pine Transportation Improvement Program Amendment, or
by reference, or will meet such minimum level of service criteria within
a reasonable period of time pursuant to the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan incorporated as to the Township of Pine
Transportation Improvements Program Amendment.
I. In order to ensure that the adopted minimum level of service is met and
to assure that the costs of the necessary transportation improvements
to accommodate the development consistent with said level of service
are funded and equitably apportioned based upon the traffic generation
characteristics of the proposed use, final approval of all such plats shall
be conditioned upon participation by the developer in the Township of
Pine Transportation Improvement Program Amendment. Said
participation shall be guaranteed by the execution of an agreement
between the Township of Pine and the traffic generator, on a form
provided by the Township of Pine, providing for payment of the
applicable impact fee at the time of issuance of a building permit for
development pursuant to the final plat as approved.

the adjacent land, guardrails shall be built to protect travel.
A. Public water supply. Where public water supply is available as
determined by the governing body, the subdivider or developer shall
provide a system of water mains and connectors with such public water
supply and provide a connection for each lot. If water is to be provided
by means other than by private wells owned and maintained by the
individual owners of lots, the subdivider or developer shall present
acceptable evidence to the governing body that the development is to
be supplied by a certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative
association of lot owners or by a municipal corporation, authority or
utility. Such acceptable evidence shall include a copy of a certificate of
public convenience from the Pennsylvania Utility Commission or an
application for such certificate, a cooperative agreement or a
commitment or agreement to serve the area in question, whichever is
appropriate.
B. Individual water supply. Where public water supply is not available, the
subdivider or developer shall supply acceptable evidence of the
availability of water. The subdivider or developer may be required to

them watertight.
(4) In all cases where it has been determined that on-site water
distribution is not feasible, a community water distribution system
shall be required. Where a community water distribution system is
reasonably feasible, it may be required by the governing body, at
the developer's expense.
D. All water supply, whether public or individual and private, shall comply
with and be subject to all applicable requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, the Allegheny County Health
Department and any municipal authority, which shall be providing
service to the subdivision or land development, and proof thereof shall
be submitted by the subdivider or developer.

Authorities and Procedures
§ 78-53. Authority of Board of Supervisors.
A. Approval of phased plans. If the proposed subdivision or land
development is planned to be completed in two or more phases over a
reasonable number of years, the governing body may authorize
submission of final plats and plans which are in compliance with all
other sections of this chapter in sections or phases of development,
provided that the governing body mandates completion of all required
improvements or appropriate requirements and completion guaranties
for and in future sections or phases of development as it finds
reasonable for the public's protection before granting final approval to
the first section or phase of the subdivision or land development which
is to be developed.
B. Waivers and modifications. The Board of Supervisors shall have the
authority to grant modifications to any of the requirements of this
chapter, provided that the following procedures and requirements are
met. Any request for a variance to any requirement of the Township
Zoning Ordinance82 shall not be within the jurisdiction of the Board of
Supervisors and shall be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board for
disposition.
(1) Modifications in cases of physical hardship. In any particular case
where the applicant can show by plan and written statement that,
by reason of topographic or other physical conditions, the literal
enforcement of any requirement of this chapter would exact undue
hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in
question, the Board of Supervisors may modify such requirements
to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such
hardship, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the intent and purpose of this chapter is
observed.
(2) Modifications to allow equal or better specifications. When an
equal or better specification is available to comply with the
Township improvement specifications or design standards of this
chapter, the Board of Supervisors may make such reasonable
modifications to such requirements of this chapter to allow the use
of the equal or better specification, upon recommendation of the
Township Engineer. In approving such modification, the Board of
Supervisors may attach any reasonable conditions, which may be
necessary to assure adequate public improvements and protect the
public safety.

B. Revisions after final plan approval. No changes, erasures, modifications
or revisions shall be made in any plan of a subdivision or land
development after final approval has been given by the governing body
and endorsed in writing on the plan, unless said plan is first
resubmitted to the governing body.
C. Sale of lots in subdivision. No lot in a subdivision may be sold, no permit
to erect, alter or repair any building upon land in a subdivision, unless
and until a subdivision plan has been approved and, where required,

county, commonwealth or federal agencies.
A. The Township hereby defines its policy to be that the Township will
withhold all public improvements of whatsoever nature, including the
maintenance of streets and the furnishing of sewerage facilities and
water service, from all subdivisions and land developments which have
not been approved and from all areas dedicated to the public which
have not been accepted by the governing body in the manner
prescribed herein.
B. Completion guaranty.
(1) Guaranty of required improvements and dedication of public
improvements. Prior to the issuance of any Township permits for
the development of a subdivision or land development, a
completion guaranty in the form of a bond, cash deposit, certified
check, other negotiable securities, irrevocable letter of credit or
other financial security acceptable to the Township shall be filed,
§ 78-57 PINE CODE § 78-61
68:446
which covers all streets, sanitary sewers, stormwater management
facilities, water systems, fire hydrants, sidewalks and other
required improvements. The guaranty shall:
(a) Run to favor of the Township.
(b) Be in the amount of 110% of the anticipated cost of
improvements as certified by the Township Engineer.
(c) Be acceptable to the Township Solicitor.
(d) Be part of an executed developer's agreement between the
Township and the subdivider/developer, which shall state all
conditions of approval and improvements, which the
subdivider/developer shall perform as part of a conditional
approval. Such developer's agreement shall be in a form and
content approved by the Township Solicitor and shall provide,
among other things, that all required approvals and permits for
the development have been secured from all appropriate
Township, county, commonwealth and federal officials, offices
and agencies. Also, a written contractual commitment shall be
supplied by the applicant, approved by the Township Solicitor,
confirming that the applicant is binding itself not to cause any
physical change in the land or to any structure which requires
prior approval or the issuance of a permit, or both, from any
governmental body or agency until such permits and approvals
are actually obtained and authorizing the Township to obtain
an immediate ex parte injunction and such other remedies as
the Township deems appropriate against the applicant, its
agents and contractors in the Court of Common Pleas of
Allegheny County if said work is commenced without such
permits and approvals. Such developer's agreement shall
further specify that the subdivision or land development shall
be completed and maintained in the manner approved in the
final plan and on the time schedule agreed upon and shall
specify remedies for failure to comply.
(2) Release of completion guaranty. Bonds, cash, checks or securities
filed as a completion guaranty shall be returned or released upon
written certification by the Township Engineer or a designated
agent that improvements and facilities have been satisfactorily
installed and completed in accordance with all applicable
standards and specifications and that all required fees have been
paid. A report on any requested release or return of a completion
guaranty shall be prepared by the Engineer within 30 days after
authorization to do so has been received pursuant to the provisions
of Section 510 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code
(53 P.S. § 10510) and the procedures for effecting the release of
such completion guaranty shall be as set forth therein.
§ 78-61 SEWERS § 78-61
68:447
(3) Default of completion guaranty. If improvements are not installed
and completed within two years of the date of recording for the plat
or do not comply with the standards and specifications of this
chapter, the Township may proceed to complete the improvements
and facilities and may use whatever proceeds from bonds, cash
deposits, checks or securities as are required to meet the expense
of completing such improvements.
(4) Dedication of public improvements. When streets, sanitary sewers,
storm drainage facilities, waterlines or other required
improvements in the subdivision or land development have been
completed in accordance with this chapter and an approved
subdivision and land development plan for the development site,
such improvements shall be deemed private until such time as they
have been offered for dedication to the Township and accepted by
separate ordinance or resolution or until they have been
condemned for use as a public facility. Prior to the acceptance of
any improvement, the Township Engineer shall inspect it to ensure
that it is constructed in accordance with the approved plan and is
functioning properly. In the case of any stormwater control facility,
it must be free of sediment and debris. In addition, the developer
shall submit as-built plans of all facilities proposed for dedication.
(5) Construction warranty. Prior to acceptance of any improvements or
facilities, the applicant shall provide to the Township, for a period
of 18 months from the date of acceptance of the improvements and
facilities, a financial security bond in the form of a bond, cash,
certified check or other negotiable securities, acceptable to the
Township, in an amount equal to 15% of the actual cost of the
improvements and facilities in order to guarantee against any
defect in material or installation of the improvements and facilities.
C. Construction of the public improvements approved in the subdivision or
land development plan shall be substantially commenced within one
year from the date the governing body gave approval to the final plan
unless such time period is extended by the governing body. If the
improvements are not completed within two years of the date of final
approval and in accordance with the standards approved in the final
plan, the governing body (unless it grants an extension thereof) shall
enforce the completion guaranty and seek any other legal and equitable
remedies it deems appropriate. If the amount of the completion
guaranty is insufficient to install, repair, correct, and maintain the
public improvements, the governing body may, at its option, do the
necessary work and initiate court action to recover the cost of such
work.

TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
GENERAL REFERENCES
Impact Fee Advisory Committee  See Ch. 20.
Subdivision and land development  See Ch.
78.
Zoning  See Ch. 84.
§ 80-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Township of Pine Transportation
Improvements Program Amendment."
§ 80-2. Purpose.
The purpose is to revise and amend the Township of Pine's Transportation
Improvement Program (as previously adopted August 7, 2000, by Ordinance
No. 283) and to establish a more current Transportation Improvements
Program, including a more current Transportation Capital Improvements
Plan, so as to ensure that the Township's transportation system is adequate
to support both existing volumes of traffic and the traffic projected to be
generated by continued new growth and land development. To advance
this objective, the Township's Transportation Improvement Program shall
be amended and be based upon the imposition of a revised transportation
impact fee, payable to the Township of Pine at the time of building permit
issuance, necessary and adequate to provide minimum levels of services (at
the "C" level) as outlined in Exhibit 2 (Township of Pine Roadway Sufficiency
Analysis Update of January, 2000) and Exhibit 3 (Township of Pine Capital
Improvements Plan Update of July, 2010) hereto.83 The program will provide
a continuing generation of funds necessary for the Township of Pine to
initiate and complete capacity transportation improvements needed in
support of continued new growth and land development. Such a program
will involve financial participation for capacity improvements by developers
and, also, by the local, state and federal governments. Through its
Transportation Improvements Program, the Township shall address its
future traffic needs in a timely manner, and the impact of increased traffic
volumes shall be minimized to the extent possible.
§ 80-3. Findings.
The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that:
A. The Township of Pine is responsible for and committed to the provision
of a transportation system at a service level necessary to adequately
support residential and nonresidential growth and development;
83.Editor's Note: Exhibits 2 and 3 are on file in the Township offices.
§ 78-64 SEWERS § 80-3
68:451
B. Such transportation service level shall be provided by the Township of
Pine utilizing funds allocated via the capital budget and capital
improvements programming processes and relying upon the funding
sources indicated in Exhibit 3 hereto.84
C. The aggregation of development in the designated transportation
service area intensifies the demand for transportation improvements
designed to accommodate traffic volumes at a level of service "C," as
defined by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy
of Science, with such level of service "C" being the minimum acceptable
level of service to accommodate such development and the intensity
thereof;
D. The development potential of the various properties in the designated
transportation service area are reflected in the Comprehensive Plan of
the Township of Pine and Exhibit 1 hereto85 and are implemented via
the Township's Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map;
E. To the extent that such land development in the designated
transportation service area places demands upon the transportation
system, those demands should be satisfied by the establishment of a
transportation improvement program which divides and distributes the
responsibility for financing the provision of such transportation
facilities between the public at-large (through the Township, state and
federal governments) and the developers of land whose land
development projects contribute to such demands;
F. The amount of the transportation impact fee to be herein imposed shall
be determined by the cost of the transportation improvements needed
to meet the minimum level of specified services and which public
facilities shall be identified in the transportation capital improvements
plan, as shown on Exhibit 3 hereto,86 considering the projected growth
and development in the transportation service area;
G. The Township of Pine hereby finds and declares that a transportation
impact fee imposed upon new residential and nonresidential land
development to assist in the financing of specified major transportation
service improvements, the demand for which has been quantified
through the application of land use assumptions provided by the
Advisory Committee and subsequently approved and adopted by the
Board of Supervisors, is and continues to be in the best interest of the
Township and its residents. It is further found and declared that such
transportation impact fee should now and hereafter be in accord with
the provisions and specifications of Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 hereof.87

§ 80-9. Calculation of transportation impact fee.
§ 80-10. Establishment of transportation service area.
The Township of Pine's transportation service area is established as shown
on the "Transportation Service Area Map" set forth as Appendix E of Exhibit
1 hereto96 and incorporated herein by reference.
A. The unit cost per trip shall be $1,300 per p.m. peak hour site
development trip, as is set forth in Exhibit 3 hereto,95 or as same may be
hereafter amended pursuant to the provisions hereof and Act 209 of
1990 (Article V-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. § 10501-A et seq.).
B. The transportation impact fee imposed hereby for a specific new
development shall be determined by multiplying the unit cost per trip
for the transportation service area by the p.m. peak hour trips
generated by such development, as identified and estimated in the ITE
Trip Generation Manual, Eighth Edition, any amendments and all future
editions thereof, or by a special transportation study undertaken in
accordance with the provisions hereof.
C. If a development upon which the transportation impact fee imposed
hereby contains a mix of uses, the transportation impact fee for same
shall be separately calculated for each type of use within the
development.

additional cost to be added to construction cost estimates for
transportation capital improvements, as deemed necessary and
appropriate, in order to cover costs anticipated.
A. Additional transportation service areas or combinations of
transportation service areas may hereafter be designated by the Board
of Supervisors, consistent with the procedures for same set forth within
Act 209 of 1990.
B. The identification of the above-referenced transportation service area
and the programming of transportation improvement projects within it
ensures that projected development within the transportation service
area will be adequately served by necessary transportation
improvements which meet the minimum level of service and that
inadequate transportation capacity will not limit development therein.

§ 80-11. Special situations.
In the event that the Township of Pine determines that the trip generation
characteristics for a specific type of development are not sufficiently
identified in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, Eighth Edition, and any
amendments thereto and any future editions thereof, the applicable
transportation impact fee shall be determined by the Township of Pine
following review of a special transportation study that shall be submitted
by the developer at developer's expense. Such study shall be prepared by a
qualified traffic or transportation engineer or planner using procedures and
methods which are both acceptable to the Township of Pine and based upon
generally accepted transportation planning and engineering standards.
Such study shall document the projected p.m. peak hour traffic volumes at
the development's site following completion and occupancy of the proposed
development.
§ 80-12. Nonbinding impact fee estimate.
Prior to making an application for any development which will be subject
to the payment of transportation impact fees, a nonbinding transportation
impact fee estimate may be requested from the Township. Such estimate
shall be based upon the maximum development potential of the
development site pursuant to existing zoning regulations, unless a lesser
use of development is requested. Said transportation impact fee estimate
shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, subject to the
availability of appropriate Township staff or consultants, and shall be on a
form provided by the Township.
§ 80-13. Administration of impact fees.
Transportation impact fees collected from development in the
transportation service area will be expended exclusively upon
transportation improvement projects within such transportation service
area.

in financial institutions authorized to receive deposits of Township
funds. Interest earned on such fees shall be credited to their respective
accounts. The Township Manager/Secretary shall obtain and provide an
annual accounting for such fund accounts in accordance with the
provisions of Act 209 of 1990, 53 P.S.§ 10505-A(d).

therefrom. The Township Manager/Secretary shall cause to be
maintained adequate financial records for each such account which
shall show the total funds collected, their sources, the interest accrued,

Transportation Capital Improvements Plan, for the particular
transportation service area.
D. Advisory Committee role. The Township of Pine's Transportation Impact
Fee Advisory Committee97 shall monitor and evaluate the
implementation of the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan and

Committee, at the request of the Township's Board of Supervisors, may
make recommendations to the Township of Pine on the need to update
or revise the adopted land use assumptions, transportation capital
improvements or impact fees based on the following:
(1) New subsequent development which has occurred in the Township
of Pine;
(2) Completed transportation capital improvements;
(3) Unavoidable delays in construction of transportation improvements
beyond the Township's control or responsibility;
(4) Significant changes in the land use assumptions;

V-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10501-A et
seq.
§ 80-15. Method of payment.
Payment of transportation impact fees shall be made prior to the issuance
of a building or other necessary permit by the Township of Pine for
development on the applicable site. In the alternative, at the sole discretion
of the Township's Board of Supervisors, such transportation impact fees
may be paid pursuant to a written agreement providing for an extended,
regular payment schedule of said transportation impact fees over a period
of time to be set by the Board of Supervisors.
§ 80-16. Credit.
A. Any developer, traffic generator, or applicant who shall be subject to the
payment of transportation impact fees pursuant to this chapter and who
shall dedicate land to the Township for future right-of-way, realignment,
or widening of any existing roadways necessary for the construction of
projects contained in the Township's Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan or who shall perform, at its own expense, the
construction of improvements contained therein shall be eligible for a
credit against the transportation impact fee otherwise due. Such credit
shall be either the amount of the fair market value of the land so
dedicated (determined as of the date of land development application)
or the amount allocated in the transportation capital improvements
program, including contingency factors, for such construction, as the
case may be.
B. In the event credit is to be provided hereunder to any developer, traffic
generator or applicant for the construction of road improvements, a
written agreement with the Township regarding same shall be executed
prior to issuance of any building permit. The agreement shall establish
the estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for initiation and
completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement be
completed to Township of Pine and Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation standards and design criteria, and such other terms and
conditions as deemed necessary by the Township of Pine, including the
posting of financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of
construction. The Township of Pine shall determine the applicable
credit, but in no event shall the Township be required to pay the excess
amount by which any credit may exceed the applicable transportation
impact fee. If the amount of the credit is calculated to exceed the
amount of the transportation impact fee due, such excess credit shall be
thereafter applied against transportation impact fees for other
developments which would otherwise be payable by the party entitled
to such credit.

ARTICLE IV
Special Overlay Districts and Planned Residential Developments
§ 84-21. GWO  Greenways Overlay District.
A. Purpose. A Greenways Overlay District is hereby established consistent
with recommendations of the Township of Pine Comprehensive Plan.
The Board of Supervisors finds and determines that the establishment
and maintenance of a greenways system as identified is the minimum
improvement for continuing the character and welfare of the Township.
B. Greenway standards. Development or redevelopment in the Greenways
Overlay District shall not be approved unless:
(1) For existing wooded areas within the Greenways Overlay District:
(a) A wooded and landscaped strip, not less than 15 feet in width
in commercial zones and 40 feet in width in all other zones,
shall be maintained along the entire frontage of the property,
except for ingress/egress for vehicles.
(b) The landscaped strip shall be comprised of an existing stand of
mature trees meeting the minimum quantity and minimum size
requirements of § 84-21 B(2)(b)[1] or [2]. [Amended
11-16-2009 by Ord. No. 352]
(c) Measurement for the greenways required by this section shall
be measured beginning at the road right-of-way line extending
away from the road parallel to the road right-of-way line.
(2) For other portions of the Greenways Overlay District:
(a) A wooded and landscaped strip, not less than 15 feet in width
in commercial zones and 40 feet in width in all other zones,
shall be created along the entire frontage of the property,
except for ingress/egress for vehicles.
(b) The landscaped strip shall include plants included in
§ 84-111B(5) and include:
[1] Commercial districts: one tree, 2 1/2 inches minimum
caliper every 30 linear feet on center.
[2] Other districts.
[a] One tree 2 1/2 inches minimum caliper, spaced no less
than 50 feet from the center of each tree to the center
of another tree.
[b] Shrubs, grasses, and groundcover plants may be
included in addition to the plantings required within
the greenway landscape strip.
§ 84-21 SEWERS § 84-21
68:527
§ 84-22. TVO  Traditional Village Overlay District.
(c) Earthen mounding shall be utilized, in areas deemed
appropriate, to help screen parking and loading areas, building
mechanical systems, or other objectionable elements or uses
on the site.
C. Structures.
(1) No structures shall be constructed within the Greenway Overlay
District or the Greenway Overlay District building setback line
unless such building setback is reduced by a provision of the
Traditional Village Overlay District (TVO) or the Town Center
Design District (TCDO).
(2) Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the setbacks for any
structure from a road right-of-way identified as a greenway for
noncommercial districts shall be 100 feet.
D. All subdivisions, land developments, and planned residential
developments shall provide easements for and connections to trails in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable
portions of the Pine Code, as amended.
E. Should PennDOT have a viable plan to acquire additional right-of-way
from any property owner along Route 19 within the Town Center Design
Overlay District (TCDO), then the Board of Supervisors may defer or
relieve the applicant of any of the greenway requirements.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to enhance and preserve the Old
Wexford area as a traditional village. This section promotes the
development of livable streets, which are oriented to and accessible by
pedestrians. Development permitted within the Traditional Village
Overlay District will have specific pedestrian and neighborhood
orientation, and will be linked together through streetscape amenities,
including sidewalks, ornamental streetlighting, pedestrian-scale
signage, street trees, and screened parking. The TVO is established to
achieve the following:
(1) To build upon and preserve the existing village development
pattern which is unique to the character, scale and history of the
Old Wexford area.
(2) To maintain the significance of the Old Wexford area as a
destination point within the Township of Pine and to retain its
identifiable sense of place.
(3) To facilitate pedestrian traffic through the development of
streetscape amenities such as sidewalks, traffic calming measures,
street-edge landscaping features, pedestrian-scale lighting and
screened parking.
§ 84-21 PINE CODE § 84-22
68:528
(4) To provide for a mix of mutually supportive uses that are unified by
the streetscape design.
(5) To limit and discourage development of strip-type, auto-dependent
commercial uses that create traffic conflicts because they require
numerous individual curb cuts and generate higher traffic volumes
which are potentially detrimental to the public safety.
(6) To encourage the consolidation of curb cuts for vehicular access
and promote more efficient and economical parking lots or
garages.
(7) Encourage uses that minimize noise and congestion.
(8) Permit uses that promote conversion or reuse of existing buildings
in a manner that maintains the character and scale of existing
development within the TVO District.
(9) Prevent the deterioration of structures and protect/support
effective rehabilitation efforts.

§ 84-23. TCDO Town Center Design Overlay District.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage the development of
a pedestrian orientated corridor that links a variety of uses through
streetscape amenities and design treatments which include sidewalks,
streetlighting, landscaping, street trees, screened and pedestrian
friendly parking lots or garages and coordinated signage. The Town
Center Design Overlay will serve as a transitional zone unifying the
unique development patterns of the Old Wexford Village Area. The
TCDO is established to achieve the following:
(1) To facilitate safe and efficient pedestrian and vehicular travel along
the Route 19 Corridor through the application of coordinated
streetscape amenities, including sidewalks, streetlighting,
landscaping, building and parking orientation and signage.
(2) To manage the development of strip type, auto-dependent
commercial uses that create traffic conflicts by requiring numerous
curb cuts and generate higher traffic volumes which are potentially
detrimental to the public safety.
(3) To create a "Town Center" environment that is unique to the
Township of Pine.
B. Uses by right. Uses shall be permitted in the TCDO District as defined
within the respective base zoning districts with the following additions
and exceptions:

an average building setback, as defined below:
[a] New development within the TCDO District shall be
permitted to use the average building setback of
existing structures located on adjacent sites.
[b] The average building setback concept may be used if
the existing front setbacks of lots within the same
block or within 1,500 feet of the subject lot, and
fronting on the same side of the street are less than
the minimum front setback.
[c] In such instances, applicants shall be permitted to use
the average front setback, where the average setback
shall be the mean (average) setback of all lots on the
same side of the street within the same block or 1,500
feet of the subject property.
[d] No more than six lots on either side of the subject
property shall be included in the calculation.
[3] The average or minimum building setback may be reduced
by 10 feet when a development or use incorporates
enhanced pedestrian spaces and amenities within the

feet above grade, it does not extend more than six
feet from the building wall, and it does not extend
higher than the first floor or 15 feet, whichever is
less.
[ii] The maximum sign area would not exceed 10
square feet per sign face.
[b] Window signs.
[i] Window signs (which include posters, signs,
symbols, and other identification of or information
about the occupant, activity, or use of the
premises) may be permitted within the allowable
total sign area applicable to the building.
[ii] Window signs shall not exceed 10% of the total
glass area of the face of the building.
[iii] Window signs shall be limited to the ground floor
or first floor windows only.
[iv] Neon window signs may be permitted in cases
where they are custom designed to be compatible
with the architectural character and exterior of
the building.
[c] Sandwich board signs.
[i] Sandwich board signs which provide a menu
option for the particular use and which are
displayed only during normal business hours may
be permitted to be placed on the sidewalk
immediately in front of the use, provided that a
five-foot clear pedestrian passage is maintained.
§ 84-25 SEWERS § 84-25
68:563
§ 84-26. Planned residential development.
[ii] One sandwich board sign may be permitted per
building and shall not exceed 10 square feet in
total sign face area.
[iii] Sandwich board signs are permitted to encroach
upon the public sidewalk provided that a five-foot
clear sidewalk passage is maintained.
(i) Vehicular circulation.
[1] Design of the area shall include a boulevard approach way
with a focal point looking toward a civic use or structure
with a plaza, square, or public green.
L. Construction in phases.
(1) If the TC-PRD and/or TCCA are constructed in phases, each phase,
when combined with the preceding phases, shall conform to all of
the requirements of this article.
(2) It is further required that a schedule for the construction of areas
of greater density concentration than permitted on the entire tract
will be offset by site improvements (infrastructure, grading,
general landscaping, etc.) which, because of the size or cost, are in
proportion to the number of dwelling units to be constructed in
each stage.
(3) As an alternative to part or all of the site improvements required to
offset development densities in excess of the overall permitted
density, the Township may require the reservation of open space by
grant, easement, or covenant in favor of the Township in an amount
and location necessary to balance the excess development density
of each phase.
A. Purpose. This article regulates and controls planned residential
development activities within the Township of Pine when a developer
chooses the planned residential development option. This article
provides uniform development standards and application processes for
a planned residential development, including provisions establishing
conditions and standards for approval, setting forth procedures for
processing applications with public hearings, governing modifications
and maintenance and processing enforcement actions, pursuant to
Article VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10701 et seq., as amended, or as may be amended in the future.
B. Planned residential development permitted. A planned residential
development shall only be available for property within the R-1
Suburban Residential Zoning District, S-1 Special Zoning District, the
E-1 Estate Residential Zoning District, and the R-2 Community
Residence Zoning District.
§ 84-25 PINE CODE § 84-26
68:564
C. Permitted uses. The following uses may be permitted in a planned
residential development, provided that their design, arrangement,
landscaping, relation to adjacent properties and uses, and construction
meet the requirements set forth in this chapter:
(1) In the E-1 Estate Residential District: Single-family detached
dwellings, recreation facilities, and accessory uses.
(2) In the S-1 Special Zoning District: Single-family detached
dwellings, recreation facilities, and accessory uses.
(3) In the R-1 Suburban Residential Zoning District: Single-family
detached dwellings, carriage homes, patio homes, recreation
facilities, and accessory uses. Carriage homes or patio homes may
only comprise 25% of the total number of dwellings in a planned
residential development in the R-1 Suburban Residential Zoning
District.
(4) In the R-2 Community Residence Zoning District: Single-family
detached dwellings, carriage homes, patio homes, recreation
facilities, and accessory uses. Carriage homes or patio homes may
only comprise 50% of the total number of dwellings in a planned
residential development in the R-2 Community Residence Zoning
District.
D. Permitted density and procedures for calculations thereof:
(1) The overall density of a planned residential development shall not
exceed the density achievable should the property be developed as
a standard subdivision.
(2) To calculate the permitted density, subtract the area of the right-ofway
for the road system and that area required for detention ponds
and access to detention ponds from the gross site area, and then
divide the remaining acreage by the minimum lot area requirement
for a standard subdivision. For the purpose of this calculation, the
area attributable for right-of-way, detention ponds, and access to
detention ponds shall be 15% of the gross site area.
(3) When a parcel proposed for development, pursuant to this article,
contains a minimum of 300 feet of frontage on, and provides the
proposed plan's main access from State Route 19, Babcock
Boulevard, Pearce Mill Road, State Route 910, and the "Red Belt"
(Bakerstown Road, Warrendale Road), then the density for each
zoning district comprising the entire parcel proposed for
development may be increased by 10%.
(4) No lot for a single-family detached dwelling within a planned
residential development shall contain less than 21,780 square feet.
§ 84-26 SEWERS § 84-26
68:565
(5) No lot for a single-family detached dwelling within a planned
residential development shall contain less than 90 feet of lot width
measured at the building setback line.
(6) In the event that a planned residential development includes
property in two or more zoning districts, the maximum number of
lots for the entire property comprising the planned residential
development shall not exceed the sum of the number of lots
permitted if the property was the subject of a standard subdivision
in each of the zoning districts.
E. Site requirements. The site for any development plan shall meet the
following requirements:
(1) Ownership. The entire site for the development plan shall be owned
or completely controlled by the developer.
(2) Minimum size. The site for the development plan shall not be less
than 25 acres.
(3) Frontage and access. The site shall have a frontage abutting a
publicly dedicated street, and such frontage shall be a minimum of
300 feet. The proposed development plan shall provide for a
minimum of two vehicular entrances/exits from developments
which contain 50 or more residential units; provided, however, that
the Township's Board of Supervisors may, in appropriate
circumstances, waive, modify, or specify an alternative to the
aforementioned minimum vehicular entrances/exits. [Amended
11-16-2009 by Ord. No. 352]
(4) Noncontiguous parcels. Two or more noncontiguous parcels of land
shall not be developed as a single planned residential development
or as separate phases of a single, multiphased planned residential
development unless the parcels are noncontiguous solely as the
result of being separated only by the width of a road upon which
each noncontiguous parcel has frontage as specified herein. The
minimum adjacent and common frontage of otherwise
noncontiguous parcels, separated only by a road as specified
above.
(5) Safety. The governing body shall determine that the site is of such
character so as to avoid danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or
other hazard. Land containing or providing hazards to life, health
or property, such as quarries, open ditches, land subject to flooding
or subsidence or land which is prone to landslides or underground
fires shall not be subdivided or developed until such hazards have
been eliminated or adequate safeguards are provided under the
development plan.
(6) Design standards and requirements. The governing body shall not
approve any application for planned residential development
except in compliance with the standards set forth in this article,
§ 84-26 PINE CODE § 84-26
68:566
and only if the land whereon buildings are to be constructed shall
be of such character that it can be used for building purposes
without danger to health, peril from flood or other hazard.
(7) Natural features. Existing natural features which would add value
to the planned residential development and the Township, such as
trees, woodlands, steep slopes, watercourses, wetlands, historic
spots and similar assets, shall be preserved as required by
standards for protection of such natural resources contained
elsewhere in this chapter. In addition:
(a) The planned residential development shall be subject to all of
the woodlands conservation and vegetation preservation
standards of this chapter.

any flowing stream or wetland except as may be expressly
permitted by action of the governing body and with the
approval and any necessary permits of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection.
(8) Water. The developer shall present evidence to the governing body
that the planned residential development shall be supplied by a
certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative association of lot
owners or by a municipal corporation, authority or utility. Such
acceptable evidence may include a copy of a certificate of public
convenience from the Pennsylvania Utility Commission or an
application for such certificate, a cooperative agreement or a
commitment or agreement to serve the area in question, whichever
is appropriate.
(9) Common open space. Common open space shall be the integral
organizing principle of the planned residential development and
shall provide for contiguous, usable lands for woodland
preservation, steep slope preservation, wetland and watercourse
preservation, and recreation. Common open space shall also
comply with the provisions this chapter.
(10) Recreation. Provisions for recreation shall be an integral
component of the planned residential development and shall be
provided for by both easements for trails and active recreation
areas. Active recreation areas shall also comply with the standards
of this chapter.
§ 84-26 SEWERS § 84-26
68:567
(11) buffer yard. A buffer yard of a minimum of 80 feet in width and in
compliance with the standards for buffer yards set forth this
chapter, subject also to the following provisions:
(a) The perimeter buffer yard may be reduced to a minimum of 40
feet in width in those perimeter areas where fringe lots, as
herein defined, are provided for in the development plan.
(b) The buffer yard or use of a combination of buffer yard/fringe lot
design shall be required in all areas of the perimeter unless the
abutting land use is that of a higher density of dwelling units
per acre than the proposed planned residential development.
(c) The proposed lot sizes along the perimeter of a proposed
planned residential development which abuts an existing
planned residential development shall not be smaller than
those on the abutting perimeter of the existing planned
residential development.
(d) The perimeter buffer yard shall maintain existing vegetation
and ground surface conditions and/or provide plantings as
required in the standards for landscape planting outlined in
this chapter.
(12) Sidewalks. Sidewalks, constructed to Township specifications for
the same, shall be provided upon every lot and to service every lot.
Sidewalks shall also be provided in such other areas (such as along
common open space areas and road rights-of-way) to provide
pedestrian access and circulation and such service as the
Township's governing body deems appropriate. Financial security
for the construction and completion of all sidewalks shall be
provided by the developer to the Township as part of his financial
guaranty of construction of public infrastructure and amenities.
F. Light and air exposure.
(1) Minimum building setback from perimeter property lines. No
structure shall be located closer to any perimeter property line
than the required rear or side yard setback plus the required
perimeter buffer yard.
(2) Minimum building setback for single-family detached dwellings
from internal property lines shall be according to the following
standards:
Setback Internal Lots Fringe Lots
Front yard* 25 feet

minimum
Adjacent zoning district
requirement
(3) Variable front setbacks are required for every three lots and shall
include no less than five nor more than a ten-foot variation from
adjacent lots.
(4) Building spacing. The requirements determining the spacing of
buildings shall be flexible so as to encourage imaginative site
design. The spaces between buildings shall be of sufficient size to
guarantee adequate light, air, and emergency access. Buildings
shall be separated by not less than 20 feet.
(5) Building groupings. Structures used for dwelling units shall be
oriented so as to ensure adequate light and air exposures for walls
containing main window exposures or main entrances. Each
structure shall be so arranged so as to avoid undue exposure to
concentrated loading or parking facilities.
G. Common open space requirements.
(1) Not less than 35% of the total site area of any planned residential
development shall be set aside for common open space. Common
open space shall be arranged to take maximum advantage of the
natural and physical characteristics of the site, to provide buffer
yard provisions for adjacent parcels and to place common open
space within easy access and view of a majority of the dwelling
units. Common open space shall also be located within the
proposed planned residential development so as to comply with the
following standards:
(a) All of the natural resource protection standards outlined in this
chapter.

feet.
(f) The common open space land shall be compact and contiguous.
(g) At least 15% of the common open space lands shall have an
existing slope of 15% or less.
§ 84-26 SEWERS § 84-26
68:569
(h) In proposed planned residential developments that abut the
Township's Greenway System, common open space shall be
located adjacent to such greenways and public access shall be
provided to such greenways by easements over such common
open space.
(i) Active recreation areas containing recreation facilities shall be
provided within the common open space as specified further in
this section.
(2) The calculation of required common open space shall specifically
not include areas containing streets, parking areas, rights-of-way,
detention ponds, or access to detention ponds. The common open
space shall be so dedicated or otherwise preserved and maintained
so as to always remain open and available for use by the occupants
of the planned residential development. The common open space,
including all improvements and recreation facilities, shall be
either:
(a) Dedicated for public use to a public body which agrees to
accept, operate and maintain the dedicated land and facilities,
but no public body is obligated by this chapter to accept such
dedication; or
(b) Deeded to an organization representing the property owners of
the development, which organization shall covenant to operate
and maintain the land and facilities for their originally
intended use. Such organization may not be dissolved nor
dispose of the common open space unless the maintenance of
the common open space is otherwise guaranteed to the
Township's satisfaction.
(3) Areas preserved as common open space shall also contain
easements for public pedestrian access as required by the trails
and linear park provisions set forth in this section.
(4) Land preserved for common open space (excepting active
recreation areas therein) shall be maintained in its existing, natural
character. Restrictive covenants acceptable to the Township and
specifically providing that such land shall not be cleared or logged,
except upon both the approval of the Township and strict
compliance with the Township's then-existing standards for the
same, shall be required to be recorded against such common open
space.
(5) Active recreation area shall meet the standards outlined in
§ 84-119.
(6) Common open space and recreation area maintenance.
(a) If the organization established to own and maintain the
common open space/recreation area or any successor
§ 84-26 PINE CODE § 84-26
68:570
organization fails to maintain such common open space/
recreation area in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the development plan, the Township may
serve written notice upon such organization or upon the
residents of the planned residential development setting forth
the maintenance deficiencies, requiring correction of
deficiencies within 30 days and stating the date and place of
a hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the
notice. At such hearing the Township may modify the terms
of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an
extension of time within which they shall be corrected. If the
deficiencies so set forth shall not be corrected within the
specified time limit, the Township, in order to preserve the
taxable values of the properties within the planned residential
development and to prevent the common open space/
recreation area from becoming a nuisance, may enter upon
and maintain the common open space for one year. This
maintenance shall not constitute a taking nor vest in the public
any rights to use the common open space/recreation area.
Before the expiration of the year, the governing body shall
set a public hearing where such organization or residents of
the planned residential development may show cause why
maintenance by the Township should not continue for another
year. If the governing body determines that such organization
is ready and able to maintain said common open space/
recreation area in reasonable condition, the Township shall
cease to maintain said common open space/recreation area at
the end of said year. If the governing body shall determine that
such organization is not ready to maintain said common open
space/recreation area in a reasonable condition, the Township
may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said common open
space/recreation area during the succeeding year and, subject
to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter.
(b) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space/recreation area and shall become a lien on
said properties. The Township, at the time of entering upon
said common open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall
file with the county a notice of lien upon properties affected.
H. Construction in phases. When a planned residential development is
constructed in phases, each phase, when combined with preceding
phases, shall conform to all of the requirements of this article. It is
further required that programs for the construction of areas of greater
density concentration than permitted on the entire tract will be offset
by site improvements which, because of their size or cost, are in
proportion to the number of dwelling units to be constructed in each
phase. As an alternative to part or all of the site improvements required
§ 84-26 SEWERS § 84-26
68:571
to offset development densities in excess of the overall permitted
density, the Township may require the reservation of open space by
grant, easement, or covenant in favor of the Township in an amount and
location necessary to balance the excess development density of each
phase.
I. Application, public hearing, and approval/disapproval procedure. In
order to provide an expeditious method for processing the development
plan for a planned residential development and to avoid delay and
uncertainty which would arise if it were necessary to secure approval
by a multiplicity of local procedures, of a plat of subdivision as well as
approval of a change in zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the
property, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest that all
procedures with respect to the application, public hearing upon, and
the approval or disapproval of a development plan for a planned
residential development and the continuing administration,
modification, or enforcement thereof shall be by the Township's
governing body and shall be consistent with the provisions of Chapter
78, Article VII; provided, however, that where such provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended (specifically
Article VII thereof regulating planned residential developments) such
latter provisions shall control.
J. Compliance. Except where specifically exempted by this article or by
formal action of the governing body, a planned residential development
shall comply with all other standards and requirements of the Township
of Pine.
K. Completion guaranties. The governing body shall, as a condition to any
tentative or final approval, require that the applicant file a certificate of
completion of improvements, approved as to form by the Township
Solicitor, for all conditions imposed on a tentative or final approval. The
governing body shall also require any applicant to execute a developer's
agreement, approved as to form by the Township Solicitor, which shall
state all conditions and improvements, which the applicant shall
perform as part of a conditional approval. In either case, the governing
body shall require financial security for the improvements by the
applicant, in a form approved by the Township Solicitor and pursuant to
the provisions of Section 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10509, conditioned upon the completion of all
required improvements and fulfillment of all conditions of approval.
L. Fees and expenses. All filing fees under this article shall be fixed, from
time to time, by resolution of the governing body, based upon the actual
expense (or reasonably anticipated estimate) to the Township to
process and review any application. The applicant shall also reimburse
the Township, within 30 days of receipt of an itemized bill, as a
condition to any approval, for the actual expenses incurred by the
Township for comment, review and inspection by it's engineers and
other professional services (including but not limited to consultants'
fees and legal fees) incurred in connection with the processing of the
§ 84-26 PINE CODE § 84-26
68:572
§ 84-26.1. PIIOD Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay
District. [Added 8-5-2013 by Ord. No. 366]
application through final approval (and thereafter for administrative
and inspection process). The imposition, collection, and administration
of all such fees and expenses shall be subject to the applicable
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code pertaining
to the same.
A. Purpose. A Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay District (PIIOD)
is hereby established to encourage the extension of public
infrastructure to areas currently unserved or underserved because of
the lack of existing public infrastructure or existing ineffective or
substandard public infrastructure, through the use of density
enhancement in certain zoning districts and, under certain
circumstances, in consideration of the extension of the public
infrastructure to areas currently unserved or ineffectively served, or by
upgrading existing substandard public infrastructure within the
Township. A PIIOD shall not be established and the density of a
property proposed for development shall not be enhanced where the
extension of the public infrastructure is required solely to serve the
parcel of land proposed for development, or the infrastructure
improvement is a required on-site improvement related to the
development of such parcel of land.
B. For the purposes of this section, "public infrastructure" may include the
following:
(1) Roadways and their necessary rights-of-way;
(2) Sanitary sewer lines and their necessary rights-of-way;
(3) Storm sewer lines and their necessary rights-of-way;
(4) Public water lines and their necessary rights-of-way.
C. Public infrastructure improvement standards. The establishment of a
Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay District (PIIOD) may be
approved by action of the Board of Supervisors upon a determination
that the following conditions are present for the parcel of land proposed
for development and that a parcel or parcels of additional property
adjacent thereto will benefit from a public infrastructure improvement:
(1) The parcel of property proposed for development shall meet the
following criteria:
(a) The parcel, or a portion thereof, shall be located in either the
Estate Residential Zoning District (E-1) or in the Special
Zoning District (S-1).
(b) The parcel shall be a minimum of six contiguous acres in size.
§ 84-26 SEWERS § 84-26.1
68:573
(c) The Board of Supervisors determines that the public
infrastructure of a parcel or parcels of land adjacent thereto is
in need of, and will benefit from, the proposed infrastructure
installation or improvement; or the Township has been advised
by (or is under order from) an outside regulatory agency to
improve public infrastructure in the vicinity of the parcel
proposed for development.
(d) The parcel shall not be permitted to additionally utilize the
planned residential development option otherwise available
pursuant to this chapter.
(2) Adjacent parcel(s) of property shall meet the following criteria:
(a) A need is established that one or more components of its public
infrastructure is in need of installation, upgrade or
improvement, as determined by the Board of Supervisors; or
the Township has been advised by (or is under order from) an
outside regulatory agency to improve public infrastructure in
the vicinity of the parcel proposed for development.
(b) A desire of the residents of the adjacent parcel(s) for public
infrastructure improvement; provided, however, that while
such desire (or lack thereof) shall be solicited or considered,
the Board of Supervisors shall retain the discretion to find that
the health, safety and welfare of the Township shall be
ultimately determinative.
(3) Density calculation. The maximum allowable density of the parcel
proposed for development shall be calculated using the Density
Calculation Worksheet found at the end of this chapter. The
calculated number of adjacent properties that shall be served by a
public infrastructure improvement shall be the minimum number of
homes found to be served by an installation or improvement of the
public infrastructure.
(4) Effect on adjacent property's zoning classification and density. The
zoning classification and density of the adjacent properties
included as a pad of the Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay
District (PIIOD) shall remain unchanged, and its current zoning
criteria shall remain applicable.
(5) Uses. Permitted and conditional uses in a Public Infrastructure
Improvement Overlay District (PIIOD) shall be the same as those
for the base zoning district in which the PIIOD is located.
(6) Area and bulk regulations. The area and bulk regulations in a
Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay District (PIIOD) shall
be the same as those specified for the R-1 Suburban Residential
Zoning District.
§ 84-26.1 PINE CODE § 84-26.1
68:574
(7) Should a Public Infrastructure Improvement Overlay District be
approved by the Board of Supervisors, the Township Solicitor shall
prepare a finding and approval document which, inter alia, details
the boundary of the PIIOD. This document shall be recorded in the
Department of Real Estate for Allegheny County and maintained in
the municipal offices of the Township of Pine.
(8) All otherwise applicable standards of the Code of the Township of
Pine, not expressly modified by a Public Infrastructure
Improvement Overlay District (PIIOD), shall remain applicable.

ARTICLE V
Regulations for Specified and Conditional Uses
§ 84-27. Purpose.
§ 84-28. Accessory uses/accessory structures. [Amended 11-16-2009
by Ord. No. 352]
Accessory uses or structures are permitted in any zoning district in
connection with any principal use lawfully existing within such district. No
accessory use or accessory structure shall be established or constructed
A. The purpose of this article is to regulate specific uses, including uses by
right, uses subject to land development review, and conditional uses,
because of the potential impacts to surrounding properties. These
restrictions are applied to mitigate impacts, including noise, off-site
parking, traffic, unsightliness, odors, dust, and fumes. The regulations
promote the public health, general safety, and neighborhood character
of the immediate neighborhood and the larger community.
B. The Board of Supervisors may, in approving a conditional use, waive
any of the requirements imposed by this article or add additional
reasonable conditions when it finds such action is deemed necessary by
reason of the unique physical conditions of the particular property or by
reason of the particular character of surrounding properties to
implement the purpose of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code or the general purposes of this chapter.
C. For uses by right, including uses that require land development review,
a variance from the Zoning Hearing Board shall be required to waive
any of the requirements imposed by this article. Prior to making a
determination, the Board of Supervisors and the Zoning Hearing Board
shall have a recommendation from staff addressing the following:
(1) The size and intensity of such use.
(2) The capacity of adjacent and feeder streets to handle peak traffic
loads and hazards created by the use as recommended by a traffic
consultant.
(3) Unusual topography of the location, the nature, location and height
of buildings, walls, stacks, fences, grades and landscaping on the
site.
(4) The extent, nature and arrangement of parking, entrances and
exits.
(5) Adequacy of fire and police protection.
(6) The availability of adequate sewer and water supply.
(7) All other standards prescribed by these regulations.
§ 84-27 SEWERS § 84-28
68:577
until the primary use or structure is constructed, unless evidence of
compliance of such use or structure shall have first been determined.

however, that such structures are used only for the housing or the
occasional housing of guests of the occupants of the principal
building and not as rental units or for permanent occupancy as
dwelling or rooming units for persons other than such guests;
(12) Living quarters for employees working on the premises of a singledwelling
unit may be housed within an accessory structure,
provided that all the requirements of this chapter and the
Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code are complied with;
(13) Picnic pavilion;
(14) Private swimming pool and/or bathhouse limited to use by the
occupants of the principal structure and their guests;
(15) Solar energy systems;

communications facilities in the Township of Pine (also referred to
herein as the "Township"). While the Township recognizes the
importance of wireless communications facilities in providing highquality
communications service to its residents and businesses, the
Township also recognizes that it has an obligation to protect public
safety and to minimize the adverse visual effects of such facilities
through the standards set forth in the following provisions.
(2) By enacting these provisions, the Township intends to:
(a) Accommodate the need for wireless communications facilities
while regulating their location and number so as to ensure the
provision for necessary services;
(b) Provide for the managed development of wireless
communications facilities in a manner that enhances the
benefits of wireless communication and accommodates the
needs of both Township residents and wireless carriers in
accordance with federal and state laws and regulations;
(c) Establish procedures for the design, siting, construction,
installation, maintenance and removal of both tower-based and
nontower based wireless communications facilities in the
Township, including facilities both inside and outside the
public rights-of-way;

(e) Minimize the adverse visual effects and the number of such
facilities through proper design, siting, screening, material,
color and finish and by requiring that competing providers of
wireless communications services co-locate their commercial
communications antennas and related facilities on existing
towers;
(f) Ensure the structural integrity of commercial communications
antenna support structures through compliance with
applicable industry standards and regulations; and
(g) Promote the health, safety and welfare of the Township's
residents.

C. General and specific requirements for all tower-based wireless
communications facilities.
(1) Regulations applicable to all tower-based wireless communications
facilities.
(a) Standard of care. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed,
constructed, operated, maintained, repaired, modified and
removed in strict compliance with all current applicable
technical, safety and safety-related codes, including but not
limited to, the most recent editions of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) Code, National Electrical Safety
Code, National Electrical Code, as well as the accepted and
responsible workmanlike industry practices of the National
Association of Tower Erectors. Any tower-based WCF shall at
all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order and
repair by qualified maintenance and construction personnel, so
that the same shall not endanger the life of any person or any
property in the Township.
(b) Notice. Upon submission of an application for a tower-based
WCF and the scheduling of the public hearing upon the
application, the WCF applicant shall mail written notice in
advance thereof (via certified U.S. mail/return receipt
requested) to all owners of every property within 500 feet of
the proposed facility. The WCF applicant shall provide proof of
the notification to the Township.
(c) Conditional use authorization required. Tower-based WCFs are
permitted in certain zoning districts by conditional use and at a
§ 84-42 SEWERS § 84-42
68:597
height necessary to satisfy their function in the WCF
applicant's wireless communications system. No WCF
applicant shall have the right under these regulations to erect
a tower to the maximum height specified in this section unless
it proves the necessity for such height. The WCF applicant
shall demonstrate that the antenna/tower/pole for the towerbased
WCF is the minimum height necessary for the service
area.
[1] Prior to the Township's approval of a conditional use
authorizing the construction and installation of towerbased
WCF, it shall be incumbent upon the WCF applicant
for such conditional use approval to prove to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Township's Board of
Supervisors that the WCF applicant cannot adequately
extend or infill its communications system by the use of
equipment such as redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other
similar equipment installed on existing structures, such as
utility poles or their appurtenances and other available tall
structures. The WCF applicant shall further demonstrate
that the proposed tower-based WCF must be located
where it is proposed in order to serve the WCF applicant's
service area and that no other viable alternative location
exists.
[2] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed
tower or other communication facilities and equipment, a
description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed
transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range
(megahertz band) assigned to the WCF applicant, the
power in watts at which the WCF applicant transmits, and
any relevant related tests conducted by the WCF applicant
in determining the need for the proposed site and
installation.
[3] The conditional use application shall also be accompanied
by documentation demonstrating that the proposed towerbased
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and
regulations concerning aviation safety.
[4] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed towerbased
WCF complies with all applicable standards in this
section.
[5] Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the WCF applicant shall present
documentation to the Township that the owner of the
property has granted an easement for the proposed WCF
and that vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
§ 84-42 PINE CODE § 84-42
68:598
(d) Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township's issuance of a
permit authorizing construction and erection of a tower-based
WCF, a structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall
issue to the Township a written certification of the proposed
WCF's ability to meet the structural standards offered by either
the Electronic Industries Association or the
Telecommunication Industry Association and certify the proper
construction of the foundation and the erection of the
structure. This certification shall be provided during the
conditional hearings or at a minimum be made as a condition
attached to any approval given such that the certification be
provided prior to issuance of any building permits.
(e) Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based
WCF shall employ stealth technology which may include the
tower portion to be painted silver or another color approved by
the Township, or shall have a galvanized finish. All tower-based
WCF and related equipment shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment
and shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the
existing surroundings and neighboring buildings to the
greatest extent possible. The Township's Board of Supervisors
shall consider whether its decision upon the subject
application will promote the harmonious and orderly
development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by
preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the
community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site
to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound
engineering and land development design and construction
principles, practices and techniques.
(f) Co-location and siting. An application for a new tower-based
WCF shall not be approved unless the Township's Board of
Supervisors finds that the wireless communications equipment
planned for the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved structure or
building. The Township's Board of Supervisors may deny an
application to construct a new tower-based WCF if the WCF
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the
commercial communications antenna(s) on an existing
structure. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers
within 1/4 mile radius of the site proposed, sought permission
to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and towers
and was denied for one of the following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
§ 84-42 SEWERS § 84-42
68:599
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
[3] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
[4] A commercially reasonable agreement could not be
reached with the owner of such building, structure, or
tower.
(g) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible
under applicable state and federal law, any WCF applicant
proposing the modification of an existing tower-based WCF,
which increases the overall height of such WCF, shall first
obtain a permit from the Township. Nonroutine modifications
shall be prohibited without a permit.
(h) Gap in coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage exists
with respect to all wireless operators in the applicable area
and that the type of WCF being proposed is the least intrusive
means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. The
existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage shall
be a factor in the Township's decision on an application for
approval of tower-based WCFs.
(i) Additional nontower WCF. As a condition of approval for all
tower-based WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide the
Township with a written commitment that it will allow other
service providers to co-locate nontower WCF on tower-based
WCFs where technically and economically feasible. The owner
of a tower-based WCF shall not install any additional nontower
WCF without obtaining the prior written approval of the
Township.
(j) Wind. All tower-based WCF shall be designed to withstand the
effects of wind according to the standard designed by the
American National Standards Institute as prepared by the
engineering departments of the Electronics Industry
Association, and Telecommunications Industry Association
(ANSI/EIA/TIA-222-E, as amended).
(k) Site plan. A site plan shall be required for all tower-based
WCFs, showing all existing and proposed structures and
§ 84-42 PINE CODE § 84-42
68:600
improvements, including but not limited to antenna and
related support structures, building, fencing, buffering and
ingress and egress.
(l) Height. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed at the
minimum functional height. The maximum total height of a
tower-based WCF which is not located in the public ROW, shall
not exceed 150 feet, as measured vertically from the ground
level to the highest point on the structure, including nontower
WCF and subsequent alterations. Should the WCF applicant
prove that another provider of wireless communications
services has agreed to co-locate nontower WCF on the WCF
applicant's tower-based WCF and requires a greater tower
height to provide satisfactory service for wireless
communications than is required by the WCF applicant, the
total Height of such tower-based WCF shall not exceed 150
feet, unless the WCF applicant secures a waiver from the
Township's Board of Supervisors which may be given at the
Board's sole reasonable discretion.
(m) Related equipment. Either one single-story wireless
communications equipment building not exceeding 500 square
feet in area or up to five metal boxes placed on a concrete pad
not exceeding 10 feet by 20 feet in area housing the receiving
and transmitting equipment may be located on the site for each
unrelated company sharing commercial communications
antenna(s) space on the tower-based wireless communications
facility.
(n) Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF shall
interfere with public safety communications or the reception of
broadband, television, radio or other communication services
enjoyed by occupants of nearby properties.
(o) Maintenance. The following maintenance requirements shall
apply:
[1] Any tower-based WCF shall be fully automated and
unattended on a daily basis and shall be visited only for
maintenance or emergency repair.
[2] Such maintenance shall be performed to ensure the
upkeep of the WCF in order to promote the safety and
security of the Township's residents, and utilize the best
available technology for preventing failures and accidents.
(p) Radio frequency emissions. Tower-based WCF shall not, by
itself or in conjunction with other WCFs, generate radio
frequency emissions in excess of the standards and regulations
of the FCC, including but not limited to, the FCC Office of
Engineering Technology Bulletin 65 entitled "Evaluating
§ 84-42 SEWERS § 84-42

Frequency Electromagnetic Fields," as amended.
(q) Historic buildings or districts. Tower-based WCF shall not be
located upon a property, and/or on a building or structure that
is listed on either the National or Pennsylvania Registers of
Historic Places, or eligible to be so listed, or is included in the
official historic structures and/or historic districts list
maintained by the Township.
(r) Signs. All tower-based WCFs shall post a sign in a readily
visible location identifying the name and phone number of a
party to contact in the event of an emergency. The only other
signage permitted on the WCF shall be those required by the
FCC, or any other federal or state agency.
(s) Lighting. No tower-based WCF shall be artificially lighted,
except as required by law. If lighting is required, the WCF
applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting,
demonstrating as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is
permissible under state and federal regulations. The WCF
applicant shall promptly report any outage or malfunction of
FAA-mandated lighting to the appropriate governmental
authorities and to the Township.
(t) Noise. Tower-based WCFs shall be operated and maintained so
as not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards
under state law and the Code of the Township of Pine, except in
emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator,
where such noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary
basis only.
(u) Aviation safety. Tower-based WCFs shall comply with all
federal and state laws and regulations concerning aviation
safety.
(v) Retention of experts. The Township may hire any consultant
and/or expert necessary to assist the Township in reviewing
and evaluating the application for approval of the tower-based
WCF and, once approved, in reviewing and evaluating any
potential violations of the terms and conditions of these
provisions. The WCF applicant and/or owner of the WCF shall
reimburse the Township for all costs of the Township's
consultant(s) in providing expert evaluation and consultation
in connection with these activities.
(w) Timing of approval. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an
application for a tower-based WCF is filed with the Township,
the Township shall notify the WCF applicant in writing of any
information that may be required to complete such application.
All applications for tower-based WCFs shall be acted upon
within 150 days of the receipt of a fully completed application

68:602
for the approval of such tower-based WCF and the Township
shall advise the WCF applicant in writing of its decision. If
additional information was requested by the Township to
complete an application, the time required by the WCF
applicant to provide the information shall not be counted
toward the one-hundred-fifty-day review period.
(x) Non-conforming uses. Non-conforming tower-based WCFs
which are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason
or cause may be repaired and restored at their former location,
but must otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of
this section.
(y) Removal. In the event that use of a tower-based WCF is
planned to be discontinued, the owner shall provide written
notice to the Township of its intent to discontinue use and the
date when the use shall be discontinued. Unused or abandoned
WCFs or portions of WCFs shall be removed as follows:
[1] All unused or abandoned tower-based WCFs and accessory
facilities shall be removed within six months of the
cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension
is approved by the Township.
[2] If the WCF and/or accessory facility is not removed within
six months of the cessation of operations at a site, or
within any longer period approved by the Township, the
WCF and accessory facilities and equipment may be
removed by the Township and the cost of removal assessed
against the owner of the WCF.
[3] Any unused portions of tower-based WCFs, including
nontower WCF, shall be removed within six months of the

(1) Total landscaped area.
(a) Residential.
[1] All residential lots less than 100 feet in width shall be
landscaped with at least three trees with a minimum of
2 1/2 inch caliper DBH for every dwelling unit on such lot.
[a] Two of such trees shall be located in the front yard to
satisfy the canopy/street tree requirement.
[b] Preserving existing trees that are of equivalent size
and number to those required hereunder shall satisfy
this requirement.
[2] Residential lots in excess of 100 feet in width shall be
landscaped in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Cluster subdivisions, townhomes, or multifamily
developments shall be landscaped in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the landscape and buffer yard
guidelines contained in this chapter.

minimum concentration in air of a gas, vapor, or particulate matter that
can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of healthy
observers. Continuous, frequent, or repetitive odors detectable after
the odorous air has been diluted with five or more volumes of odor-free
air shall be a violation of these standards.
B. No use other than agricultural in any zone may generate any odor that
reaches the odor threshold, measured at:
(1) The outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the
enterprise generating the odor.
(2) The lot line if the enterprise generating the odor is the only
enterprise located on the lot.

68:741
increase the amount of impervious area and shall be designed to ensure
that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff from the site shall be no
greater after development than the rate of runoff from the site prior to
development, and be subject to release rates within the Pine Creek or
applicable watershed.
A. Statement of findings. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Pine
finds that:
(1) Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities
threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration
of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities, which
overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers,
and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
(2) Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
(3) Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer
systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
(4) Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to
erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases pollution of water resources.
(5) Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
(6) Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate
storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). Permittees are required to enact,
implement, and enforce a prohibition of nonstormwater discharges
to the permittee's regulated small municipal separate storm sewer
systems (MS4s).
B. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote health, safety, and
welfare within the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the
harms and maximizing the benefits described in this section, through
provisions designed to:
(1) Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
(2) Provide review procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning and management.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:742
(3) Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
(4) Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
(5) Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program
to address nonstormwater discharges into the Township's separate
storm sewer system.
C. Statutory authority. The Township also is empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.121
D. Applicability. All activities related to proper operation and maintenance
of approved stormwater management BMPs and all activities that may
contribute nonstormwater discharges to a regulated small MS4 are
subject to regulation by this section.
E. Repealer. Any other provision(s) or provision of the Code of the
Township of Pine or regulation of the Township inconsistent with any of
the provisions of this § 84-125 are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
F. Severability. In the event that any provision of this § 84-125 is declared
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not
affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of such section.
G. Compatibility with other requirements. Actions taken under this section
do not affect any responsibility, permit or approval for any activity
regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or ordinance.
H. Definitions applicable to this section. As used in this section, the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ACCELERATED EROSION  The removal of the surface of the land
through the combined action of human activities and the natural
processes, at a rate greater than would occur because of the natural
process alone.
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture
such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal
heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including
tillage, land clearing, plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting
crops or pasturing and raising of livestock and installation of
conservation measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious
area is not considered an agricultural activity.

68:743
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this section. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one
of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural."
In this section, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational
and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.

I. General standards. The following provisions shall be considered the
overriding performance standards against which all proposed
stormwater control measures shall be evaluated:
(1) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent injury to health, safety and other property.
Such measures shall include, but not be limited to, such actions as
are required to:
(a) Assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities.
(b) Manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which will not adversely impact
the health on, or value of, any affected properties and in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law.
(2) Design storms.
(a) Stormwater management detention/retention facilities within
a development shall be designed to handle the peak rate of
runoff from one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year frequency storm events. Whenever the
provisions of federal or state law impose a greater design
storm frequency, as for example, where drainage systems cross
highways, the stricter standards shall prevail.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:747
(b) All stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be designed
with emergency overflow facilities for the one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour duration storm.
(c) The stormwater volume required for all stormwater retention/
detention facilities shall be that volume necessary to handle
runoff of a one-hundred-year storm in any development, less
that volume discharged during the same storm period used to
calculate the volume of rainfall, at the approved release rate.
(d) The SCS, Type II Rainfall distribution shall be used for all
analyses. The design storm frequencies for the watershed are:
Design Storm
Rainfall Depth 24 Hours
(inches)
1 year 1.97
2 year 2.35
5 year 2.88
10 year 3.30
25 year 3.90
50 year 4.40
100 year 5.20
(3) The stormwater management plan shall consider all of the
stormwater runoff flowing over the project site. Runoff calculations
shall be made to insure that runoff from the fully developed
upstream watershed area (based on the Township's Comprehensive
Land Use Plan) can be accommodated by the pipes, drainage
easements and watercourses, etc., on the site.
(4) Joint development of control systems. Stormwater control systems
may be planned and constructed in coordination with two or more
developments, provided they are in compliance with the applicable
provisions of this section.
(5) Method of computation. All computations used in conjunction with
the analysis and design of stormwater management facilities shall
be based on one or more of the following methods:
(a) TR-55 - Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55.
(b) TR-20 - Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 20.
(c) Modified rational method.
(d) Penn State runoff model.
(e) Virginia Tech/Penn State runoff model. These methods for
determining peak discharge shall be used to:
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:748
[1] Determine predevelopment runoff conditions;
[2] Analyze the impact of development and compute the
increase in runoff after development; and
[3] Perform calculations in the design of any detention/
retention facilities used in controlling runoff.
[a] These methods of runoff computation developed and
used by the Soil Conservation Service and other
authorities are hereby adopted by the Township.
[b] The use of the Basic Rational Method in estimating
runoff may be employed in the design of the storm
sewer system within the development. The storm
sewer system shall be interpreted as the conduits,
culverts, inlets, and appurtenant features for the
conveying of stormwater to, through, or from a
development site to the point of final discharge or
control facility. The Rational Method shall not be used
in the analysis of stormwater runoff from the
development in its entirety or in conjunction with the
design of any retention/detention facilities or other
runoff control measures.
(6) Release of detained stormwater. The approved peak release rate of
stormwater from all retention/detention facilities for any storm
event shall be that which is experienced prior to development for
the same storm event up to and including the one-hundred-year
storm. Therefore, all retention/detention facilities shall provide
staged release of the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and
one-hundred-year storms.
(7) Design of stormwater management facilities outlined in the plan
requires that runoff calculations be made for the site and areas,
which contribute drainage to the site. These calculations should be
based on land use, time of concentration, and other standard
aspects of hydraulic analysis.
(a) Temporary control measures/facilities. Runoff calculations of
the site's condition during development will be used to size
temporary control measures.
(b) Permanent control measures/facilities. Permanent control
measures/facilities shall be designed to assure that the
maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no greater after
development than prior to development activities, utilizing the
one-hundred year storm as a basis for calculations. Storm
sewer systems may be designed for the twenty-five-year storm
provided that the runoff will naturally drain to the detention
facility; otherwise, the storm sewer system must be designed
for the one-hundred-year storm event. Runoff calculations
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:749
must be made to insure that runoff from the fully developed
upstream watershed area (based on the Township's or
Allegheny County's Comprehensive Land Use Plan) can be
accommodated by the pipes, drainage easements,
watercourses, etc., on the site as well as those downstream
of the site to a point of permanent stream discharge. Where
downstream facilities are not adequate to convey flow, reduced
release rates shall be considered and utilized.
(8) Runoff calculation shall also include complete hydrology and
hydraulic analysis of all downstream swales and pipe facilities to
permanent stream discharge point as well as all erosion control
facilities. Analysis shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) Computation of hydraulic and energy gradelines. Velocities of
flow, slopes, capacity and roughness coefficient of conduits and
grassed waterways.
(b) Capacity of sediment basins and permanent holding ponds.
(c) All drainage facilities shall be designed to contain the energy
gradeline for the peak flow rate for the design storm within the
structure a minimum of two feet below the surface elevation.
The hydraulic grade line must be within the pipe. Swales and
channels shall provide at least one foot of freeboard above the
energy gradeline. Backwater effects of pipes discharging
under surcharge conditions shall be included.
(9) Single-family lots.
(a) Retention facilities shall be constructed for all single-family lot
developments or single-family lots located in land
developments, which for terrain reasons cannot utilize the
development's retention systems. Retention facilities shall
consist of gravel filled sumps, ponds, tanks or other approved
facilities, sized in accordance with standard details in the
Township Construction Standards. Refer to Figures SWM 6,
6-A and 7 for minimum volume size per single residence roof
area.
(b) Storage volumes for roof areas greater than 5,000 square feet
shall be calculated using the methods outlined in this section.
(c) All stormwater retention facilities shall be located at least 10
feet from foundation walls in a location approved by the
Township. All pipe from roof drains to a point 10 feet from the
structure shall be a minimum Schedule 40 PVC pipe or
approved equal.
(10) Easements. Easements for stormwater management facilities shall
be required to have a minimum width of 20 feet. Where a
subdivision or land development is, or will be, traversed by a
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:750
watercourse, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage
easement of a width sufficient for the purpose, but not less than 20
feet. The stormwater detention facilities must be provided within
a drainage easement. An access easement must be provided from
the public right-of-way to the stormwater detention facility with a
minimum width of 20 feet.
(a) Operation and management plans for stormwater management
approved pursuant to 25 Pa. Code § 102 after the date of this
section shall be recorded as a restrictive deed covenant that
runs with the land.
(b) If a conservation easement is provided the long-term
ownership, access, maintenance, and use restrictions must be
identified on the recording plan.
(11) Flood-prone areas. Land identified as flood-prone on maps issued
by the Federal Insurance Administration shall be subject to the
regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program and shall
comply with the provisions of the Code of the Township of Pine
governing floodplains.
(12) Stormwater detention facilities.
(a) If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility shall be designed such that the post-development peak
runoff rates from the development site are controlled to those
rates defined by the subarea release-rate percentage or noharm
evaluation for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-
, and one-hundred-year design storms. Except, however, where
downstream flooding problems exist, the Township may impose
additional reduced release-rate criteria. Detention facilities
shall drain within 24 to 72 hours from the end of the storm
event.
(b) All detention facilities shall be equipped with multistage outlet
structures to provide discharge control for the one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm
frequencies. Provisions shall also be made for safely passing
the post-development one-hundred-year storm runoff flows
without damaging (i.e., impairing the continued function of)
the facilities.
(c) Shared-storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site, may be considered within a
single subarea. Such facilities shall meet the design criteria
contained in this section. In addition, runoff from the
development sites involved shall be conveyed to the facility in a
manner so as to avoid adverse impacts, such as flooding or
erosion, to channels and properties located between the
development site and the shared-storage facility.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:751
(d) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple-use
facilities, such as lakes, ballfields, or similar recreation uses,
are encouraged wherever feasible.
(e) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the
design of the detention facilities include:
[1] Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and
installed to prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundmenttype
structures should be protected from soil erosion.
[2] Control and removal of debris, both in the storage
structure and in all inlet or outlet devices, shall be a design
consideration.
[3] Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations and other
structures shall be protected and designed to minimize
safety hazards.
[4] The water depth of a storage pond shall be limited to that
which is safe for children. Otherwise, appropriately
landscaped fencing at least four feet in height shall be
required.
[5] Side slopes of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of 3:1
horizontal to vertical dimension.
[6] Landscaping shall be provided for the facility, which
harmonizes with the surrounding area.
[7] The facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will
be required.
[8] Detention ponds shall be designed to be integrated into
the overall site design and incorporate landscaping
features, fountains and passive recreational amenities
such as benches and pathways to provide an aesthetic and
functional facility that fits within the character of the
Township.
[a] When aesthetic and passive recreational amenities are
incorporated into the design of the detention pond,
the detention pond may be calculated as a part of the
required open space as required elsewhere in this
chapter.
[b] Side slopes of such detention ponds shall not exceed a
ratio of four-to-one horizontal to vertical dimension.
[9] Infiltration best management practices (BMPs) shall be
spread out and shallow as much as practicable.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:752
J. Additional requirements.

applicant shall refer to and meet all conditions and requirements
set forth in the provisions of § 84-125.1 of the Code of the Township
of Pine regulating municipal separate storm sewer systems
("MS4s") prohibited discharge.
K. Design calculations and reports.
(1) Stormwater runoff and design calculations shall be submitted to
the Township Engineer for review and to the Board of Supervisors
for approval with the application for preliminary and/or final
approval of a subdivision, land development, or any other activity
that require stormwater management. Plans, profiles, cross
sections reports and/or specifications showing complete
construction details shall be submitted with the application for final
approval.
(2) The stormwater runoff and design calculations, plans and reports
shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a Pennsylvania-registered
engineer with qualifications and experience in preparing
stormwater management plans.
(3) Additional analysis, calculations and design criteria may be
required for both on-site and off-site stormwater systems where it
has been determined by the Township Engineer that further study
is necessary.
(4) Upon request by the Township Engineer, stormwater runoff
calculations shall be provided for: the outlet and inlet sides of all
stormwater drainage and storage facilities and structures; at points
in a public street with a change of grade; or where water from a
proposed structure, facility or vehicular way is to enter an existing
public street, existing storm sewer, existing drainage ditch or
existing stormwater storage facility.
L. Exemptions for small developments.
(1) At the time of application, the Township shall determine if the
development qualifies as a "small development" and, therefore, is
eligible for a simplified stormwater plan submission. For the
purposes of this section, a small development is:
(a) Any development which results (or will result when fully
constructed) in the creation of 5,000 square feet or less of
impervious surface area.
(2) A small development shall be exempt from the preparation of a
stormwater management plan, pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code. However, such developments shall
provide safe management of stormwater in accordance with the
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:753
performance standards of this section and as approved by the
Township.
(3) Application for small developments shall include a plan, which
describes, narratively and graphically, the type and location of
proposed on-site stormwater management techniques or the
proposed connection to an existing storm sewer system. Depending
upon actual site conditions, the number of lots proposed and
similar considerations, the Township shall determine if the plan
must be prepared by a registered professional engineer.
(4) The Township Engineer shall review and the Township shall
approve the proposed provisions for stormwater management for
small developments. Where the applicant is proposing to connect to
an existing storm sewer, the applicant's engineer shall determine
that sufficient capacity exists in the storm sewer from the point of
connection to the point of outlet in the natural drainage system.
The Township shall also determine if the proposed development
site is part of a larger parcel or tract, which was subject to any
specific stormwater management controls contained in a prior
plan.
(5) For a parcel or tract of land held in single ownership, only one
application for a small development, as defined above, shall be
permitted before requiring a stormwater management plan for the
entire parcel. A project cannot be phased to circumvent the
stormwater requirements by using the exemption for small
developments.
M. Stormwater plan content. The stormwater management plan for all
developments except small developments, as defined in Subsection L
above, shall consist of the following three components:

N. Stormwater management performance standards.
(1) Stormwater management districts.
(a) For purposes of stormwater management, the Township is
divided into the following stormwater management districts:
[1] Pine Creek.
[2] North Fork.
[3] Brush Creek.
[4] Montour Creek.
[5] Breakneck Creek.
(b) One or more of these districts may be further divided into
subareas which have similar hydrological characteristics and
drain to a common point.
(c) The location and boundaries of the stormwater management
districts and subareas are adopted as overlay districts to the
Township Zoning Map and are shown on Appendix D125
attached hereto and on the watershed maps which are
maintained in the Township office.
(2) General standards. The following provisions shall be considered
the overriding performance standards against which all proposed
stormwater control measures shall be evaluated, except for the
Pine Creek Watershed, which may have stricter standards, and they
shall apply in all stormwater management districts in the
municipality.
124. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
125. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:758
(a) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are
reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or
other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required:
[1] To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is
no greater after development than prior to development
activities; or
[2] To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise
adequately protects health and property from possible
injury.
(b) The stormwater management plan for the development site
must consider all the stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
(c) No discharge of toxic materials into any stormwater
management system will be permitted.
(3) Watershed standards for all watershed districts. The stormwater
performance standards contained in this section are intended to
implement the standards and criteria contained in the Pine Creek
Watershed Stormwater Management Plan, as well as the other
applicable watershed areas, adopted and approved as required by
the Pennsylvania Storm Water Management Act (32 P.S. § 680.1 et
seq.). If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
chapter and the standards and criteria of the plan, or if the
watershed plan is subsequently amended, then the standard
criteria of the current watershed plan shall govern.
(a) Release-rate percentage.
[1] Application. All subdivisions and land development
activities which result in an increase in the postdevelopment
peak rate of stormwater runoff from any
outfall on the development site shall be subject to releaserate
percentage for the watershed subarea in which the
site (or outfall) is located. A listing of the release-rate
percentage for each subarea in the Pine Creek Watershed
appears as Appendix E126 at the end of this section, and the
subareas are delineated on the watershed subarea map
(see Appendix D127 and as such is maintained in the
Township's office) in the watershed plan.
[2] Definition. The release-rate percentage defines the
percentage of the redevelopment peak rate of runoff that
126. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
127. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:759
can be discharged from an outfall on the site after
development. It applies uniformly to all land developments
or alterations within a subarea, and the post-development
rate of runoff discharging from each outfall of the
development site cannot exceed the release-rate
percentage for the subarea in which it is located.
[3] Procedure for use. The steps that must be followed to
utilize the release-rate percentage for a particular
development site are as follows:
[a] Identify from the watershed subarea map the specific
subarea in which the development site is located and
obtain the subarea release-rate percentage.
[b] Compute the pre- and post-development runoff
hydrographs for each stormwater outfall for the site,
using the soil cover complex method (SCS TR-55), for
the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five- and one hundred-year
design storms, applying no on-site detention for
stormwater management, but including any
techniques to minimize impervious surfaces and/or
increase the time of concentration for stormwater
runoff flowing over the development site. If the postdevelopment
peak runoff rate is less than or equal to
the predevelopment peak runoff rate, then additional
stormwater control shall not be required at that
outfall. If the post-development peak runoff rate is
greater than the predevelopment value, then
stormwater detention will be required and proceed to
Subsection E(3)(b)[3][c] below.
[c] Multiply the subarea release-rate percentage by the
predevelopment rate of runoff from the development
site to determine the maximum allowable release rate
from any detention facility for the two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five- and one-hundred-year design storm
events.
(b) No-harm evaluation.
[1] An applicant may seek to extend the otherwise applicable
subarea release-rate percentage by performing the noharm
evaluation, which requires an independent
engineering analysis to demonstrate that other reasonable
options exist to protect downstream areas from harmful
storm runoff impacts.
[2] The no-harm evaluation shall be prepared by a registered
engineer who is experienced in hydrology and hydraulics.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:760
[3] The analysis for the no-harm evaluation shall be submitted
to the Township for review by the Township Engineer and
approval of the Township.
(c) Runoff curve numbers.
[1] The following runoff curve numbers shall be used:
Ground
Cover
Hydraulic
Soil
Group
Curve Numbers
A B C D
Woodland 30 55 70 77
Meadow 30 58 71 78
Grass 39 61 74 80
Impervious 98 98 98 98
Gravel 89 89 89 89
[2] Wooded sites and developed sites shall assume for the
predevelopment condition that the site is wooded in good
condition.
(d) Time of concentrations.
[1] Sheet flow lengths shall not exceed 100 feet.
[2] Shallow concentrated flow lengths shall not exceed 1,000
feet.
(e) Mannings 'n' values.
[1] Impervious surfaces: n = 0.011.
[2] Agricultural lands: n = 0.17.
[3] Grass, lawn, or open space: n = 0.24.
[4] Wooded areas: n = 0.40.
(4) Redevelopments greater than 2,000 square feet shall conform to
the following requirements:
(a) One of the following minimum performance standards shall be
accomplished. Selection of the performance standard shall be
determined by which is the most appropriate for the given site
conditions:
[1] Reduce the total impervious cover of the site (i.e., by using
pervious pavement, replacement of pavement with
pervious planting areas or green roof systems) by at least
25%, based on a comparison of existing impervious cover
to proposed impervious cover; or
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:761
[2] Provide facilities designed to attenuate the runoff volume
from the one-year twenty-four-hour post development
storm event for at least 24 hours, or
[3] Provide facilities to insure that the post development peak
discharge rate shall not exceed the predevelopment peak
discharge rate multiplied by the "sub-basin release rate
percentage" (where determined in the Pine Creek
watershed) for the two- and ten-year twenty-four-hour
storm events. A maximum predevelopment cover CN of 70
shall be assumed.
(b) Water quality improvements shall be provided for drainage
areas not otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either
at the source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from
the source of runoff. Stormwater quality management facilities
shall be designed to capture and treat 0.25 inch of runoff from
all pavement areas (i.e., parking lots, pavements and
noncovered sidewalks). Roof area may be excluded from this
calculation.
(5) New developments shall conform to the following requirements:
(a) Water quality improvements shall be achieved in conjunction
with or as part of infiltration practices (if used). Water quality
improvements shall also be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff
generated by the one-inch rainfall event. Follow current DEP
standards for design of water quality BMPs.
(b) The post development peak discharge rate shall not exceed the
predevelopment peak discharge rate multiplied by the "subbasin
release rate percentage" (where determined in the Pine
Creek watershed) for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm events
pursuant to the predevelopment cover assumptions.
(c) Facilities capable of attenuating rainfall runoff shall be
provided and be designed to attenuate the runoff volume from
the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event for at least 24
hours.
(d) Stormwater shall be infiltrated and/or discharged within the
same drainage area of the stream receiving the runoff from the
development site prior to development.
(e) Structural and nonstructural stormwater management
practices that make best possible use of infiltration on-site
shall be considered in all site designs, when appropriate.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:762
O. Construction criteria for stormwater control facilities. Stormwater
management facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the
following minimum specifications:
(1) All workmanship and materials shall conform to the adopted
Township's Standard Details. In addition, all workmanship and
materials shall conform to the latest edition of Penn DOT Form 408
and be supplied by manufacturers or suppliers listed in Penn DOT's
Bulletin 15.
(2) All connections to existing storm sewer pipes shall be made by
construction of a suitable junction box (inlet or manhole) to provide
access for cleanout. No blind connections shall be permitted.
(3) All pond outlet structure pipes shall have suitable gaskets to
prevent leakage and piping of water through the pond
embankment.
(4) All pipe outlets shall discharge onto a stone riprap blanket to
prevent erosion of soil. Riprap will be sized considering pipe exit
velocities.

otherwise as outlined in the staging of earthmoving activities
section of the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
(6) The discharge of stormwater runoff shall be to a well-defined
drainage course, which has a defined bed and bank. If stormwater
runoff cannot be discharged to a defined drainage course,
documentation of written permission from each downstream
property owner shall be provided and recorded for all properties
between the source of discharge and the defined drainage course.
(7) All stormwater detention facilities shall be screened from view of
existing roads or streets located within the Township, which is a
minimum of six feet in height with sufficient access or maintenance
vehicles. The screening materials must be approved by the
Township. Landscaping of the pond embankment shall not be
permitted.
(8) Provide a geotechnical report for the construction of all stormwater
facilities, including the following: stormwater detention basins and
the embankment; drainage swales; and infiltration areas.
P. Maintenance criteria for stormwater control facilities. Maintenance is
an essential part of the successful functioning of a stormwater
management system and the following shall be required:
(1) Maintenance during development. Maintenance during
development of a project shall be the responsibility of the
developer and/or landowner and shall usually include, but shall not
be limited to:
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:763
(a) Removal of silt from all debris basins, traps or other structures
or measures when 40% of capacity is filled with silt.
(b) Disposal of collected silt in a manner which will not adversely
affect the environment.
(c) Periodic maintenance of temporary control facilities such as
replacement of straw bale dikes, straw filters, or similar
measures.
(d) Establishment or reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and
mulching or sodding of scoured areas where vegetation has not
been successfully established. A developer or landowner
retains this obligation as to property he or she has developed
or improved even if the proper season for "seeding" occur
initially sometime after the project is otherwise completed in
whole or as to a particular phase.
(e) Installation of necessary controls sufficient to protect against
problems caused by storm events within design frequencies.
(f) Removal of all temporary measures upon completion of the
project.
(2) After acceptance of the plan by the Township. In the event that the
Township accepts public improvements in the plan, except in cases
where an agreement between the developer and the Township have
been executed to the contrary, the maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the developer or his assigns and shall include,
where necessary:
(a) Mowing to maintain adequate stands of grass and to control
weeds. Chemical weed control may be used if state and
Township regulations are met. Selection of seed mixtures shall
reflect the type of maintenance desired by the Township.
(b) Removal of silt from all permanent structures, which trap silt
or sediment to keep this material from building up in grassed
waterways and other permanent structures, thereby, reducing
their capacity.
(c) Removal of trees and shrubs from pond embankments.
(d) Repair of animal burrows and removal of animals causing the
same.
(3) It shall be the responsibility of the developer to inspect all
permanent facilities to see that corrective action is taken where
necessary.
(4) Stormwater facilities located on private property shall be
maintained by the landowner or his agent; however, this does not
relieve the landowner or his agent of the obligation to inspect their
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:764
own facilities. The Township reserves the right to enter upon
private property to make periodic reasonable inspections and to
require the landowner to take necessary corrective actions. An
easement shall be recorded granting access over private property
to the stormwater facilities.
(5) The owner shall convey to the Township easements and/or rightsof-
way to assure access for periodic inspections by the Township
and maintenance if required.
(6) The owner shall keep on file with the Township the name, address
and telephone number of the person or company responsible for
maintenance activities; in the event of a change new information
will be submitted to the Township within 10 days of the change.
(7) The owner shall establish any special maintenance funds or other
financing sources, in accordance with the approved maintenance
plan.
(8) The owner shall pay the amount due to the Special Stormwater
Facility Maintenance Fund.
(a) Persons installing stormwater storage facilities will be
required to pay a specified amount to the Township of Pine
Stormwater Facility Maintenance Fund to help defray the costs
of periodic inspections and annual maintenance expenses. The
amount of the deposit shall be determined as follows:
[1] If the storage facility is to be privately owned and
maintained, the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic
inspections performed by the Township or its agents for a
period of 10 years, as reasonably estimated by the
Township. After that period of time, inspections will be
performed by the Township or its agents and billed directly
to the owner.
[2] If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Township, the deposit shall cover the estimated annual
costs for maintenance and inspections to be performed by
the Township or its agents for 10 years, as reasonably
estimated by the Township.
[3] The amount of the deposit to the maintenance fund
covering annual inspection and maintenance costs shall be
converted to present worth of the annual series values.
The Township Manager shall determine the present-worth
equivalents, which shall be subject to the final approval of
the Township Supervisors.
(b) If the storage facility which is proposed also serves as a public
recreation facility, such as a lake or ballfield, the Township may
reduce or waive the amount of the required deposit to the
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:765
maintenance fund based on the value of the land for public
recreation purposes.
(c) If at some future time any storage facility (whether publicly or
privately owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm
sewers or another storage facility (i.e., a distributed storage
facility), the unused portion of the maintenance fund will be
applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to
the storm sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the
deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment and
connection are paid will be returned to the depositor.
(9) If the owner fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities,
following due notice by the Township to correct the problems, the
Township shall perform the necessary maintenance or corrective
work. The owner shall reimburse the Township for all costs upon
presentation of documentation of same.
(10) Additional items may be included in the maintenance agreement
where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory
maintenance of all facilities. The maintenance agreement shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Township's Solicitor.
Q. Inspections of stormwater management controls during construction.
(1) The Township or a designated representative shall field review the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater
management facilities for the development site. The permittee shall
notify the Township 48 hours in advance of the completion of the
following key development phases:
(a) At the completion of the preliminary site preparation, including
stripping of vegetation, stockpiling of topsoil and construction
of temporary stormwater management and erosion control
facilities.
(b) At the completion of rough grading, but prior to placing
topsoil, permanent drainage or other site development
improvement and ground covers.
(c) During construction of the permanent stormwater facilities at
such times as specified by the Township.
(d) Completion of permanent stormwater management facilities,
including established ground covers and plantings.
(e) Completion of any final grading, vegetative control measures
or other site restoration work done in accordance with the
approved plan and permit.
(2) No work shall commence on any subsequent phase until the
preceding one has been field reviewed by the Township Engineer
and approved by the Township in writing. If there are deficiencies
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:766
in any phase, the Township shall issue a written description of
the required corrections and stipulate the time by which the
corrections must be made.
(3) If during construction the contractor or permittee identifies any
site conditions, such as subsurface soil conditions or alterations in
surface or subsurface drainage, which could affect the feasibility of
the approved stormwater facilities, said person must notify the
Township within 24 hours of the discovery of such condition and
request a field review by the Township. The Township shall
determine if the condition requires a stormwater plan modification.
(4) In cases where stormwater facilities are to be installed in areas of
landslide-prone soils or where other special site conditions exist,
the Township may require special precautions, such as soil tests
and core borings, full-time resident project representative services
and/or similar measures. All costs of any such measures shall be
borne by the permittee.
R. Stormwater culverts. Stormwater culverts, bridges and similar
structures serving public streets, access driveway or other vehicular
rights-of-way shall be designed to support HS-20 loading and any other
imposed loadings necessary without structurally damaging the
drainage system. Stormwater culverts, bridges or other structures
which do not serve vehicular traffic shall be designed to support the
necessary loading without structurally damaging the pipe or affecting
its capacity for drainage. Said design shall be approved by the
Township Engineer and shall comply with the following requirements.
(1) Conduit size of culverts and other enclosed components of a
stormwater drainage system shall be based on computed
hydrologic and hydraulic data and computations shall be approved
by the Township. The minimum size of any enclosed structure to be
maintained by the Township shall be 15 inches in diameter. The
minimum size of any enclosed structure to be privately maintained
shall be 15 inches in diameter, unless the design calculations,
approved by the Township, justify a lesser size. In no case shall
larger pipes/culverts be connected to smaller pipes/culverts.
(2) The design of any enclosed drainage course shall provide a
minimum cleaning velocity of three feet per second. When the
design provides for a maximum velocity greater than 10 feet per
second, the enclosed components shall be lined or protected to
prevent scour.
(3) The design of headwall and endwall structures for enclosed
stormwater facilities shall be approved by the Township and shall
be in accordance with the Township Construction Standards.
(4) Energy dissipaters shall be required at the outlet side of all
enclosed culverts or similar components and shall be designed in
accordance with the Township Construction Standards.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:767
(5) The type of materials used for enclosed culverts and similar
components shall comply with the Township's Standard Details. No
stormwater facility shall be enclosed or covered over until the
Township has field reviewed the construction.
S. Open stormwater drainage courses. Open stormwater drainage courses
shall be designed for a maximum velocity not to exceed 10 feet per
second and a minimum velocity of five feet per second. A minimum
velocity of three feet per second may be authorized by the Township
where a greater slope cannot be achieved to permit the standard
required minimum velocity. An open stormwater drainage course shall
include a lining (riprap, concrete or bituminous) to prevent erosion. The
applicant shall obtain approval from the Allegheny County
Conservation District (ACCD), if required.
T. Prohibition against nonstormwater discharges. Prohibited discharges.
(1) No person in the Township shall allow, or cause to allow,
stormwater discharges into the Township's separate storm sewer
system which are not composed entirely of stormwater, except:
(a) As provided in § 84-125T(2); and
(b) Discharges allowed under a state or federal permit.
(2) Discharges which may be allowed, based on a finding by the
Township that the discharge(s) do not significantly contribute to
pollution to surface waters of the commonwealth, are:
(a) Air-conditioning condensate;
(b) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
(c) Discharges from fire-fighting activities;
(d) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
(e) Irrigation drainage;
(f) Lawn watering;
(g) Pavement washwaters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred, and where detergents
are not used;
(h) Potable water sources, including dechlorinated waterline and
fire hydrant flushing;
(i) Routine external building washdown (which does not use
detergents or other compounds);
(j) Springs;
(k) Uncontaminated groundwater;
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:768
(l) Uncontaminated water from foundation or footing drains;
(m) Water from individual residential car washing;
(n) Water from sump pumps.
(3) In the event that the Township determines that any of the
discharges identified in § 84-125T(2) significantly contribute to
pollution of waters of the commonwealth, or is so notified by DEP,
the Township will notify the responsible person to cease the
discharge.
(4) Upon notice provided by the Township under § 84-125T(3), the
discharger will have a reasonable time, as determined by the
Township, to cease the discharge consistent with the degree of
pollution caused by the discharge.
(5) Nothing in this section shall affect a discharger's responsibilities
under state law.
(6) Prohibited connections. The following connections are prohibited,
except as provided in Subsection T(2) above:
(a) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows any nonstormwater discharge,
including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water, to
enter the separate storm sewer system, and any connections to
the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks; and
(b) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the separate storm sewer system, which
has not been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent
records, and approved by the Township.
U. Requirement for erosion and sediment controls.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
(2) The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more,
under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
(3) In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES
Construction Activities permit is required for any earth disturbance
of one acre or more with a point source discharge to surface waters
or the Township's storm sewer system, or five acres or more
regardless of the planned runoff (hereinafter collectively referred
to as "regulated earth disturbance activities"). This includes earth
disturbance on any portion of, part of, or during any stage of, a
larger common plan of development.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:769
(4) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or
Allegheny County Conservation District must be provided to the
Township. The issuance of an NPDES Construction Permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide General Permit (PAG-2)]
satisfies this requirement.
(5) A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
V. Postconstruction stormwater runoff controls for new development and
redevelopment, including operations and maintenance of stormwater
best management practices (BMPs).
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan, which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
after construction, is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and maintain the
level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
(3) To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated
earth disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff
conditions, so that postconstruction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (#392-0300-002, September 28,
2002), this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration: Replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment: Use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(c) Streambank and streambed protection: Management of
volume and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to
prevent physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from
scouring and erosion).
(4) DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation, and maintenance of best management practices
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:770
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and
redevelopment (hereinafter "development") after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete. These requirements include
the need to implement postconstruction stormwater BMPs with
assurance of long-term operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
(5) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or
Allegheny County Conservation District must be provided to the
Township. The issuance of an NPDES Construction Permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide General Permit (PAG-2)]
satisfies this requirement.
W. Post-construction stormwater record plan.
(1) Prior to issuance of an occupancy permit or utilization of the
proposed improvements, the applicant must provide the Township
a certified post-constructed stormwater record plan, a copy of a
recorded stormwater operations and maintenance (O&M) plan and
stormwater operations and maintenance (O&M) agreement and the
proof of recording for any project containing stormwater
management facilities including storm sewers and BMPs.
(2) The owner shall provide a digital file, on state plain coordinate
system, of the location of all BMPs constructed on the property.
X. Right of entry.
(1) BMP owners and operators shall allow persons working on behalf
of the Township ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of determining compliance with this section.
(2) Persons working on behalf of the Township shall have the right to
temporarily locate on any BMP in the Township such devices as are
necessary to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the discharges
from such BMP.
(3) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Township access to a BMP
shall be deemed a violation of this section.
Y. Enforcement and sanctions.
(1) The violation of any provision of this section is hereby deemed a
public nuisance.
(2) Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
(3) Whenever the Township finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the
Township may order compliance by written notice to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:771
(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(b) The elimination of prohibited discharges;
(c) Cessation of any violating discharges, practices, or operations;
(d) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(e) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation
costs;
(f) The implementation of stormwater BMPs; and
(g) Operation and maintenance of stormwater BMPs.
(4) Failure to comply within the time specified shall also subject such
person to the penalty provisions of this section. All such penalties
shall be deemed cumulative and shall not prevent the Township
from pursuing any and all other remedies available in law or equity.
(5) Suspension and revocation of permits and approvals. Any building,
land development or other permit or approval for regulated earth
disturbance activities issued by the Township may be suspended or
revoked for:
(a) Noncompliance with or failure to implement any provision of
the permit;
(b) A violation of any provision of this section; or
(c) The creation of any condition or the commission of any act
during construction or development which constitutes or
creates a hazard or nuisance, pollution or which endangers the
life or property of others.
(6) Penalties.
(a) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be subject
to a fine of not more than $500 for each violation, recoverable
with costs, or imprisonment, or both. Each day that the
violation continues shall be a separate offense.
(b) In addition, the Township, through its Solicitor, may institute
injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this
section. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the
right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent
injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of remedy
or relief.
Z. Fees and expenses.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:772
(1) General.
(a) The Township may charge a reasonable fee for review of BMP
operations and maintenance plans to defray review costs
incurred by the Township. The applicant shall pay all such fees.
(2) Expenses covered by fees. The fees required by this section may
cover:
(a) Administrative/clerical costs.
(b) The review of the BMP operations and maintenance plan by the
Township's Engineer and the review or preparation of any
necessary associated documents by the Township's Solicitor.
(c) The site inspections including, but not limited to, preconstruction
meetings, inspections during construction of
stormwater BMPs, and final inspection upon completion of the
stormwater BMPs.
(d) Any additional work or costs required to monitor and enforce
any provisions of this section, correct violations, and assure
proper completion of stipulated remedial actions (including but
not limited to attorneys' fees incurred by the Township in
pursuit of legal proceedings associated therewith).
AA. Operations and maintenance of BMPs.
(1) The stormwater operations and maintenance (O&M) plan for the
project site shall establish responsibilities for the continuing
operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater BMPs, as
follows:
(a) If a plan includes structures or lots which are to be separately
owned and in which streets, sewers and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to the Township, stormwater
BMPs may also be dedicated to and maintained by the
Township;
(b) If a plan includes operations and maintenance by a single
ownership, or if sewers and other public improvements are to
be privately owned and maintained, then the operation and
maintenance of stormwater BMPs shall be the responsibility of
the owner or private management entity.
(2) The Township shall make the final determination on the continuing
operations and maintenance responsibilities. The Township
reserves the right to accept or reject the operations and
maintenance responsibility for any or all of the stormwater BMPs.
(3) The Township shall review the BMP operations and maintenance
plan for consistency with the purposes and requirements of this
section, and any permits issued by DEP.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:773
(4) The Township shall notify the applicant in writing whether the BMP
operations and maintenance plan is approved.
(5) The Township may require an "as-built survey" of all stormwater
BMPs, and an explanation of any discrepancies with the operations
and maintenance plan.
(6) It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater
BMP required by an approved stormwater operations and
maintenance plan, or to allow the property to remain in a condition
which does not conform to an approved operations and
maintenance plan, unless an exception is granted in writing by the
Township.
(7) An operation and maintenance agreement (substantially in the
form specified in Appendix A to this section)128 shall be required to
be executed by the landowner. Other items may be included in the
agreement where determined necessary to guarantee the
satisfactory operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater BMPs. The agreement shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Township.
(8) The Township may suspend or revoke any approvals granted for the
project site upon discovery of the failure of the owner to comply
with this section.
(9) If stormwater BMPs are accepted by the municipality for
dedication, the Township may require persons installing
stormwater BMPs to pay a specified amount to the Township's
Stormwater BMP Operation and Maintenance Fund, to help defray
costs of operations and maintenance activities. The amount may be
determined as follows:
(a) If the BMP is to be owned and maintained by the Township, the
amount shall cover the estimated costs for operations and
maintenance for 10 years, as determined by the Township.
(b) The amount shall then be converted to present worth of the
annual series values.
(c) If a BMP is proposed that also serves as a public recreation
facility (e.g., ball field, lake), the Township may reduce or
waive the amount due accordingly (based upon the value
received for public recreation purposes).
BB. Storm sewer and drainage facilities.
(1) Size and grade. Storm drains shall be adequate for the anticipated
runoff when the area is fully developed. The minimum diameter of
storm sewers shall be 15 inches, and the minimum grade shall be
128. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:774
1%, unless approved by the Township. Minimum pipe cover shall
conform to manufacturer's recommendations.
(2) Manholes. Manholes for pipe sizes of 24 inches or less shall be
spaced at a maximum of 400 feet and for larger pipe sizes, the
maximum distances between manholes shall be 600 feet. In
addition, manholes shall be installed at all points of changes in
horizontal alignment and vertical grade. Inlets may be substituted
for manholes where practical.
(3) Inlets. Inlets of the type shown in the Township's Standard Details
shall be installed. Inlets at street intersections shall be placed on
the tangent and not on the curved portions.
(4) Castings. Manholes and inlet castings shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Form 408
and PennDOT Standards for Roadway Construction. Inlet grates
shall be bicycle safe. Frames and grates shall be cast iron or
structural steel. Concrete frames shall not be permitted.
(5) Stormwater roof drains. All roof drains shall discharge to an on-lot
sump or to a storm sewer system, which is controlled by a detention
pond. Outlets from roof drain sumps shall not discharge directly
onto fill slopes. Outlets shall not discharge directly to the gutter
line of any street. All pipes from roof drains shall be a minimum
four-inch Schedule 40 ABS, PVC or SDR 35 pipe. Four-inch
Schedule 40 PVC or ABS pipe is required for a distance of 10 feet
from the foundation of the dwelling. No stormwater drainage
system shall be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer
system. No pipes shall be permitted to be constructed through any
curbing on any public street.
(6) Unnatural drainage. All points of concentrated flow discharge shall
outlet directly to a well-defined drainage channel, with a defined
bed and bank. Whenever construction stops or concentrates the
natural flow of storm drainage in such a way as to affect adjoining
properties, approval of the owners shall be obtained in writing.
Approval of plans by the Township shall not authorize or sanction
drainage affecting adjoining properties.
(7) Watercourses. Open watercourses shall not be permitted within the
rights-of-way of streets. The stopping, filling up, confining or other
interference with, or changing the course of, drains, ditches,
streams and watercourses in the Township shall not be permitted
unless approval in writing is obtained from the Township. A permit
must be obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for
construction or changes in a watercourse subject to the regulations
of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
(8) Wherever conveyance channels are necessary, drainage shall be
maintained by an open channel with landscape banks designed to
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:775
carry the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour stormwater runoff
from upstream contributory areas. If the runoff from stormwater
collection and conveyance facilities would drain over land to a
stormwater detention facility, the twenty-five-year frequency storm
event may be used. The Township Engineer with the approval of the
Township may increase the design storm, as conditions require. All
open channels shall be designed with one foot of freeboard above
the design water surface elevation of the design runoff condition.
(9) Flood relief channels shall be provided and designed to convey the
runoff from the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm, such
that a positive discharge of this runoff is to a natural drainage
course with a defined bed and bank.
(10) Where drainage swales are used in lieu of or in addition to storm
sewers, they shall be designed to carry the required runoff without
erosion and in a manner not detrimental to the properties they
cross. Drainage swales shall provide a minimum grade of 1% but
shall not exceed a grade of 9%. Drainage swales used strictly for
conveyance are not the same as open vegetated channels.
(11) When requested by the Township the developers shall obtain or
grant a minimum twenty-foot-wide drainage easement over all
storm sewers, drainage swales, channels, etc., that are a
component of the stormwater management system when located
within undedicated land. All permanent detention basins and/or
other stormwater management facilities providing stormwater
control for other than a single residential lot shall be located within
a defined drainage easement that allows proper legal access and
maintenance vehicle access.
(12)No property owner shall obstruct or alter the flow, location or
carrying capacity of a stream, channel or drainage swale to the
detriment of any other property owner, whether upstream or
downstream. All subdivision and/or land development plans
containing streams, channels, drainage swales, storm sewers or
other conveyance systems that cross property boundaries, existing
or proposed, or whose discharge crosses such boundaries shall
contain a note stating the above.
(13)No stormwater pipe (public or private) shall be less than 15 inches
in diameter that conveys surface runoff. The minimum pipe slope
shall be such that a minimum of two-feet-per-second velocity is
maintained. Where a culvert or pipe is used to replace a stream, the
cross-sectional area shall be at least as large as the original stream
channel. All stormwater BMPs shall be constructed in accordance
with the Township's adopted Standard Details. Minimum pipe cover
shall conform to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stormwater
conveyance pipes utilized in BMPs shall have a pipe size of fourinch
diameter or larger.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125
68:776
(14) Where open watercourses for stormwater drainage are used the
following standards shall apply:
(a) Artificial channels shall be of trapezoidal cross section, with
the channel width at the bottom at least 10 times the maximum
water depth which would be produced by the one-hundredyear
design storm and with rough, permeable and flexible sides
and bottom. No artificial channel shall be used to replace a
natural stream.
(b) At all points in the drainage system the velocity shall be less
than the erosion threshold of the conveyance material,
including at the outlet from the construction area or
subdivision site.
(15) All stormwater collection and conveyance facilities (pipes, swales,
and structures) shall be designed for a one-hundred-year design
storm event, unless the runoff would naturally drain overland to a
stormwater detention facility, in which case a twenty-five-year
design storm event may be used. All drainage facilities shall be
designed to contain the energy gradeline for the peak flow rate for
the design storm within the structures a minimum of two-footbelow-
surface elevation. The hydraulic grade line must be within
the pipe. Swales and channels shall provide at least one foot of
freeboard above the energy gradeline. Backwater effects of pipes
discharging under surcharge conditions shall be included in the
calculations.
(16) All workmanship and materials shall conform to the Township's
Standard Details. In addition, all workmanship and materials shall
conform to the latest edition of PennDOT Form 408 and be supplied
by manufacturers or suppliers listed in PennDOT's Bulletin 15.
(17) All connections to existing storm sewer pipes shall be made by
construction of a suitable junction box (inlet or manhole) to provide
access for cleanout. No blind connections shall be permitted.
(18) All pipe outlets shall discharge onto a stone riprap blanket to
prevent erosion of soil. Riprap shall be sized considering pipe exit
velocities.
(19) The discharge of stormwater runoff shall be to a well-defined
drainage course, which has a defined bed and bank. If stormwater
runoff cannot be discharged to a defined drainage course,
documentation of written permission from each downstream
property owner shall be provided for all properties between the
source of discharge and the defined drainage course.
(20) Inlets of each type shown in the Township's Standard Details shall
be installed. Inlets at street intersections shall be placed on the
tangent and not on the curved portion of the intersection radii.
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:777
(21) Bridges and culverts. All bridges and culverts shall be designed to
support expected loads and to carry expected flows and shall be
designed to meet current standards of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation. All bridges and culverts shall be
subject to all permits required by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Dams, and Waterways.
(22)Water quality inlets. Storm drainage systems that collect runoff
from parking areas and/or loading areas exceeding 10,000 square
feet of impervious coverage and discharge to stormwater
management systems, including surface or subsurface infiltration
systems, shall have a minimum of one water quality inlet per each
acre of drainage area. The water quality inlet must provide for the
removal of oil, grease, and heavy particulates and total suspended
solids, hydrocarbons and other floating substances from
stormwater runoff.
CC. Intersections of private driveways and public streets. Stormwater
drainage facilities shall be placed where each private driveway
intersects with a public street. The design shall be approved by the
Township and shall meet the following requirements: The facility shall
be placed to maintain the flow line of the stormwater drainage facility in
the public street.

designed and constructed in accordance with the Township's
Standard Details.
(2) Where reinforced concrete, metal or tile pipe is to be used beneath
the driveway, said pipe shall not be less than 15 inches in diameter
and shall extend across the full width of the driveway and beyond
the driveway for a distance determined by the Township. The pipe
shall be installed with flared end sections and shall be designed to
support H-15 loading and any other imposed loadings necessary
without structurally damaging the system. The installation of the
pipe shall be in accordance with the adopted Township's Standard
Details.
DD. Testing. All construction materials used in storm sewers shall be tested
by a qualified testing laboratory, if required by the Township. The cost
for such tests shall be borne by the developer.
EE. Standard schedule for maintenance of stormwater management
facilities.
(1) The stormwater management plan developed for the project is
supplemented by this maintenance plan to help ensure continuing
operations of all stormwater facilities.
(2) The following is a list of items that shall be inspected and corrective
action taken by the owner. (Note: "Owner" refers to individual
ultimately responsible for storm facility condition and function).

landowner, or the owner's designee (including the Township for
dedicated and owned facilities), according to the following list of
minimum frequencies:
(a) Annually for the first five years following construction.
(b) Once every three years thereafter.
(c) During or immediately after the cessation of a ten-year or
greater storm event.
(2) The Township of Pine may require other items to be included in the
operations and maintenance agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all
facilities. If stormwater facilities are not maintained by the
Township of Pine, the owner shall maintain all facilities in
accordance with the approved maintenance schedule and shall
keep all facilities maintained in a safe and attractive manner. The
owner shall convey to the Township of Pine easements and/or
rights-of-way to assure access for periodic inspections by Pine and
maintenance if required. The owner shall keep on file with Pine the
§ 84-125 SEWERS § 84-125
68:779
§ 84-125.1. MS4 Prohibited discharge. [Added 2-2-2015 by Ord. No.
373]
name, address, and telephone number of the person or company
responsible for maintenance activities and an as-built drawing of
all stormwater facilities.
(3) In the event of a change, new information will be submitted to the
Township of Pine within 10 days of the change. The owner shall
establish any special maintenance funds or other financing sources,
in accordance with the approved maintenance plan. If the owner
fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities, following due
notice (30 days) by Pine to correct deficiencies, Pine shall perform
the necessary maintenance or corrective work. The owner shall
reimburse Pine for all costs associated with the required
maintenance of the stormwater control facilities.
A. Statement of Findings. The governing body of the Township of Pine
finds that:
(1) Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to
erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases pollution of water resources.
(2) Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal
separate storm sewer systems is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
(3) Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
(4) Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate
storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). Permittees are required to enact,
implement, and enforce a prohibition of nonstormwater discharges
to the permittee's regulated small municipal separate storm sewer
systems (MS4s).
B. Purpose. The purpose of this § 84-125.1 is to promote health, safety, and
welfare within the Township of Pine and its watershed by minimizing
the harms and maximizing the benefits described herein, through
provisions designed to:
(1) Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
§ 84-125 PINE CODE § 84-125.1
68:780
(2) Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters
of this commonwealth.
(3) Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
(4) Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
(5) Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
(6) Provide proper operation and maintenance of all facilities and all
SWM BMPs that are implemented within the Township of Pine.
C. Statutory authority. The Township of Pine also is empowered to regulate
land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July
31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.129
D. Applicability. All activities related to proper operation and maintenance
of approved stormwater management BMPs and all activities that may
contribute nonstormwater discharges to a regulated small MS4 are
subject to regulation by this § 84-125.1.
E. Compatibility with other requirements. Actions taken under this
§ 84-125.1 do not affect any responsibility, permit or approval for any
activity regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or any other
provision of the Code of the Township of Pine.

grouped into one of two broad categories or measures: "structural"
or "nonstructural." In this section, nonstructural BMPs or measures
refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices that attempt
to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a
physical device or practice that is installed to capture and treat
stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to,
a wide variety of practices and devices, from large-scale retention
ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground
treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact
design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales,
riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.

ARTICLE VII
Nonconformities
§ 84-128. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate nonconforming uses,
nonconforming buildings and structures, nonconforming lots and
nonconforming signs. The zoning districts established by this chapter are
designed to guide the future use of the Township's land by encouraging
the development of desirable residential, commercial and other uses with
appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses that promote and
protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The regulations of
this article are intended to restrict further investments that would make
nonconformities more permanent in their location in inappropriate districts
as well as to afford opportunities for creative use and reuse of those other
nonconformities that contribute to a neighborhood and are consistent with
the goals of the Township's Comprehensive Plan.
§ 84-129. Identification and registration of nonconforming uses and
structures.
The Zoning Officer shall identify and register all nonconforming uses,
buildings/structures, and lots within the Township, together with the
reasons why the Zoning Officer identified them as nonconformities. Legally
registered nonconforming uses shall not lose their nonconforming status
due to acquisition in part for a state or local highway project, whether by
amicable deed or condemnation, that affects the dimensional nonconformity
of the property. If a variance request is deemed required for such a property,
the impact of the acquisition for public purposes shall be an unnecessary
hardship to the property.
§ 84-130. Nonconforming use.
A. Continuation of nonconforming use. Any lawfully existing
nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the regulations contained in this section. Ordinary
repair and maintenance or replacement, and installation or relocation
of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, may be performed.
B. Structural alteration or enlargement of nonconforming use. No
structure containing a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered
or enlarged unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No parking,
yard, space or bulk nonconformity may be created or increased.
C. Change of nonconforming use to conforming.
(1) Whenever any nonconforming use shall have been changed or
altered so as to conform to the provisions of this chapter or its
amendments, then such nonconforming use shall no longer be
§ 84-128 SEWERS § 84-130
68:789
nonconforming to the extent to which it then conforms to this
chapter or its amendments.
(2) The prior nonconforming use shall not be resumed; provided,
however, that if a later amendment to this chapter should make the
use as so changed or altered nonconforming with its provisions
then such use as changed or altered shall become a new
nonconforming use to the extent of such nonconformance or
noncompliance.
D. Expansion or extension of nonconforming use.
(1) No nonconforming use may be extended or expanded in any
building or structure, or in or on the lot on which it is located, nor
may any nonconforming use be moved to a different position upon
the lot on which it is located, so as to alter the use or its location
which existed at the time that the use became nonconforming.
(2) A nonconforming use or structure may not be extended, expanded,
structurally altered or changed unless to a conforming use or
structure, except as a conditional use allowed by the governing
body pursuant to this chapter, provided that structural alteration
may be made pursuant to an order of an authorized public officer to
assure the safety of the structure.
(3) Whenever a use district shall be hereafter changed by a duly
adopted amendment to this chapter, then any existing legal,
nonconforming use of such changed district may be continued, and
such use may be extended throughout the structure, provided that
such extension does not displace any residential use in an E, S or R
District.
E. Abandonment or discontinuance of nonconforming uses.
(1) The lawful use of the land existing at the time this chapter or any of
its amendments was adopted, although such use does not conform
to the provisions hereof, may be continued, but if such
nonconforming use is abandoned for a period of one year, any
future use of said land shall conform to the provisions of this
chapter.
(2) Any subsequent use shall conform to the applicable provisions of
this chapter or its amendments and the prior nonconforming use
shall not be resumed, unless in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter or its amendments.
(3) For the purpose of this section, the following circumstances, which
shall not be exclusive, shall contribute towards evidence of
discontinuance or abandonment of a use:
(a) Failure to maintain regular business hours, typical or normal
for the use (past operations of the use and/or industry
§ 84-130 PINE CODE § 84-130
68:790
§ 84-131. Nonconforming buildings or structures.
standards may be used to determine typical or normal hours);
or
(b) Failure to maintain equipment, supplies or stock-in-trade,
which would be used for the active operation of the use; or
(c) Failure to maintain utilities which would be used for the active
operation of the use; or
(d) Failure to pay taxes, including but not limited to sales taxes,
workers' compensation taxes, corporate taxes, etc., that would
be required for the active operation of the use; or
(e) Failure to maintain required local, state, or federal licenses or
other approvals that would be required for the active operation
of the use.
F. Nonconforming accessory uses and structures. No use, structure or
sign that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue
after such principal use or structure has been abandoned or removed,
unless it shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
A. Continuation of nonconforming buildings or structures. Any
nonconforming building or structure which is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in this
section.
B. Structural alteration or enlargement of nonconforming buildings or
structures. The lawful use of a structure existing at the time of the
adoption of this chapter or an amendment hereto may be continued or a
structure lawfully under construction at the time of the enactment of
this chapter may be used as contemplated, although such use or
structure does not conform to the provisions hereof, and such use may
be extended throughout the structure, provided that such extension
does not displace any residential use in an S or R District. No parking,
yard, space or bulk nonconformity may be created or increased.
C. Changes to nonconforming buildings or structures to conforming.
(1) Whenever any nonconforming building or structure shall have been
changed or altered to conform to the provisions of this chapter or
its amendments in effect at the time of such change or alteration, or
whenever any amendment to this chapter shall make such building
or structure conforming with the provisions of this chapter or its
amendments, then such building or structure shall remain in
conformance with the applicable provisions of this chapter or its
amendments.
§ 84-130 SEWERS § 84-131
68:791
(2) If a later amendment to this chapter should make the building or
structure as changed or altered nonconforming with its provisions,
then the building or structure as changed or altered will become a
nonconforming building or structure to the extent of such
nonconformance or noncompliance.
D. Damage or destruction of nonconforming buildings or structures.
(1) When a building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any
means not within the control of the owner, to the extent of 60% or
more of the cost of replacement of the structure, the structure shall
not be restored unless its use thereafter conforms to the use
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No parking,
yard, space or bulk nonconformity may be created or increased.
(2) When a structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within
the control of the owner thereof to the extent of 60% or less of the
cost of replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of
such structure may be made; provided, however, that no parking,
yard, space or bulk nonconformity is created or increased.
(3) In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by
any means within the control of the owner be repaired or restored,
except in accordance with this section.
E. Expansion or extension of nonconforming buildings or structures.
(1) No nonconforming building or structure may be extended on the lot
on which it is located, nor may any nonconforming building or
structure be moved to a different position upon the lot on which it is
located, except to a position in conformity with the current Codes,
except as a conditional use allowed by the governing body pursuant
to this chapter, provided that structural alteration may be made
pursuant to an order of an authorized public officer to assure the
safety of the structure.
(2) Whenever a use district shall be hereafter changed by a duly
adopted amendment to this chapter, then any existing legal,
nonconforming structure of such changed district may be
continued, and such use may be extended throughout the
structure, provided that such extension does not displace any
residential use in an E, S or R District.
(3) For dwellings, if the reason for the existing nonconformity consists
only of the inadequacy of required yards, then expansion may occur
without a conditional use permit if such expansion, extension or
other increase in size in itself conforms with all applicable
ordinances and laws.
F. Repairs, renovation and modernization of nonconforming buildings or
structures.
§ 84-131 PINE CODE § 84-131
68:792
§ 84-132. Nonconforming lots of record.
(1) Repairs, renovations and modernization of nonconforming
buildings or structures, such as renewal or replacement of outer
surfaces, windows, addition of soundproofing materials, air
conditioning and repair or replacement of structural parts or
members of the building or structure shall be permitted
notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter.

(1) In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is
destroyed or partially destroyed by fire, explosion or other cause,
the nonconforming building or structure may be reconstructed and
the nonconforming use thereof continued if the reconstruction is
commenced within one year of the date of destruction or damage.
(2) If reconstruction does not commence within one year after the
occurrence of the damage or destruction, or is not thereafter
diligently completed, then any use, building, or structure on the lot
shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.
(3) The reconstruction of the said building or structure shall not
exceed the size of the nonconforming building or structure
destroyed or damaged and shall be placed in the same location on
the ground as the nonconforming building or structure destroyed
or damaged.
(4) The nonconforming use thereof shall not differ from that existing
prior to such damage or destruction unless a variance is applied for
and obtained under this chapter, except that the repair, renovation
and modernization of such nonconforming building or structure
authorized by this section shall nevertheless be permitted.
(5) Any such reconstruction shall be subject to and in accordance with
any applicable building, electrical, fire and plumbing codes, safety
regulations or other regulations or laws.

§ 84-133. Nonconforming signs.
Continuation of nonconforming signs. Subject to the limitations and
termination provisions hereinafter set forth, any lawfully existing
nonconforming sign may be continued so long as it otherwise remains
lawful after the effective date of this chapter:
A. In any district in which single-family dwellings are a use by right,
notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provisions of this
chapter, a single-family detached dwelling which complies with the
yard, space and bulk requirements of the district in which it is located
may be erected on a nonconforming lot adjacent to an improved street.
Nothing in the requirements of this chapter relating to lot area per
dwelling unit shall be held to prohibit the erection of a single-dwelling
unit upon a lot having less than the required street frontage or the area
of which is less than that prescribed as the lot area per dwelling unit,
provided that such lot, at the time of the passage of this chapter, was
held under separate ownership from any adjoining lots or provided that,
at the time of the passage of this chapter, a recorded plan of lots or
subdivision of property shows such lot to be a separate and distinct
numbered lot.
B. In any district in which single-family dwellings are not permitted, a
nonconforming lot of record may be used for any use by right in the
district in which it is located if land development approval is granted in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 78.
A. Alteration or moving. A nonconforming sign of any type may not be
moved to another position or location upon the building, structure or lot
on which it is located, nor may the size or area of such nonconforming
sign be changed or its structure or construction changed unless such
changes are minor in nature.
B. Damage, destruction or replacement. Whenever any nonconforming
sign has been damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 60%
of its market value at the time of destruction or damage, such sign shall
not be restored or replaced, unless it conforms to all provisions of this
chapter.
C. Abandonment. If use of a nonconforming sign is abandoned for a
continuous period of more than one year, then such nonconforming sign

§ 84-135. Building permits required.
A. Authority. The Zoning Officer in the Township of Pine shall have the
authority to issue building permits in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
B. Purpose. The building permit provides a procedure for ensuring
compliance with this chapter and a means for evidencing such
compliance. Further, it serves as an adjunct to, and thus must be
obtained prior to or with, all applications filed pursuant to this chapter
with respect to a specific use or development proposal.
C. Standards.
(1) No person shall erect, reconstruct or structurally alter a structure
or fence in any district unless there has been duly issued to such
person a building permit by the Zoning Officer. However, no permit
shall be required for the erection or structural alteration of a fence
not exceeding six feet in height.
D. Procedure.
(1) Applications for building permits shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer, and a duplicate shall be filed with the Township Manager.
The application shall include plans and other information sufficient

chapter until the stormwater management plan and all other
required plans for the property or lot have been submitted and
approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
chapter and Chapter 78, Subdivision and Land Development, of the
Pine Code. Further, the Township shall not issue the permit until
any required floodplain, dam safety or obstructions, erosion/
sedimentation approval/permits, permits from the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP), the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, or other required permits have been received from
the applicable local, county or state agencies. Copies of the
approval/permit must be filed with the Township.

shall be approved by the appropriate sanitary authority before a
building or sewage permit is issued.
(4) All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat
in triplicate drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the
lot to be built upon, the size of the building to be erected and such
other information as may be necessary. A file of such applications
and plats shall be maintained by the Zoning Officer.
A. Authority. No building hereafter erected, reconstructed or structurally
altered shall be used or changed in use and no owner, tenant or person
shall begin to use an existing building until a certificate of occupancy
and compliance shall have been issued by the governing body stating
that the building or the proposed use of the same complies with the
provisions of this chapter and any of its amendments and the
Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code.
B. Purpose. The certificate of occupancy and compliance provides a
procedure for reviewing plans for compliance with this chapter and a
means for evidencing such compliance. Further, it serves as an adjunct
to, and thus must be filed prior to or with, all applications filed pursuant
to this chapter with respect to a specific use or development proposal.
C. Certificate issued in conflict is void. Any certificate issued in conflict
with the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.
D. Standards.
(1) Certificates of occupancy and compliance, either for the whole or a
part of a building, may be applied for coincident with the
application for a building permit or after completion of
construction and may be issued after the erection or structural
alteration of such building or part shall have been completed in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and the Pennsylvania
Uniform Construction Code.
(2) A record of all certificates shall be maintained by the governing
body, and copies shall be furnished on request to any person who
has a proprietary or possessory interest in the building affected.
E. Procedures.

Zoning Officer, and a duplicate copy shall be filed with the
Township Manager.
F. Temporary certificate of occupancy and compliance.
(1) The Zoning Officer may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy
and compliance which may permit the use or occupancy of a
building or structure during structural alteration thereof or may
permit the partial use or occupancy of a building or structure
during its construction or erection.
(2) Such a temporary certificate of occupancy and compliance shall be
valid only for a period not exceeding six months from its issuance,
and shall be subject to such restrictions and provisions as may be
deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to adequately insure the
safety of persons using or occupying the building, structure or land
involved.
(3) Application for such a temporary certificate of occupancy and
compliance shall be made in the same manner as for a certificate of
occupancy and compliance, and the application for or issuance of
such a temporary certificate of occupancy and compliance shall in
no way affect the obligation to apply for and obtain a certificate of
occupancy and compliance nor in any way alter the rights, duties
and obligations of the Township or the owners and users of
buildings, structures or land within the Township with regard to the
matters governed by this chapter except as expressly set forth in
this section.
A. Authority. In certain portions of this chapter, certain specified
conditional uses may be authorized if first approved by the Board of
Supervisors. Conditional uses may be allowed or denied by the
governing body after recommendation by the Planning Commission and
following a public hearing.
B. Purpose. Conditional uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness which requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration and special impact to determine, against fixed standards,
the desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site.
They are uses that may or may not be appropriate in a particular
location depending on the applicant's ability to assure compliance with
the Township's codes and regulations.
C. Standards.
(1) Where the Zoning Chapter has stated conditional uses to be
granted or denied by the governing body pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the governing body shall hold hearings on
and decide requests for such conditional uses in accordance with
§ 84-136 SEWERS § 84-137
68:797
such standards and criteria. In granting a conditional use, the
governing body may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the chapter, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purpose of this act in the Zoning
Chapter.
(2) A conditional use shall be approved if and only if it is found to meet
the following general criteria and specific criteria for each
conditional use listed in this section and requirements found
elsewhere in this chapter.

that is consistent with, and not harmful to, the environment of
the neighborhood.
(f) The proposed use shall organize vehicular access and parking
to minimize conflicting traffic movement on adjacent streets.
(g) The proposed use shall promote the objectives of this chapter
and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the

Board of Supervisors may impose such reasonable conditions
and safeguards, in addition to those otherwise specified in this
chapter or incorporated herein by reference, as it may deem
necessary to implement the Zoning Chapter.
(b) The Board of Supervisors may require that such conditions and
safeguards be incorporated in a plan of lots or other
appropriate recordable form and filed in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Allegheny County.
(c) Each situation shall be deemed to be separate and individual,
and the disposition made by the Board of Supervisors shall
apply only to the case in point and shall in no way be construed
to establish precedent.
E. Revocation of approval.
(1) Approval by the Board of Supervisors of a conditional use referred
to in this section shall be void in the event a building permit is not
applied for within 12 months and construction is not started within
18 months.
(2) An extension of up to six months may be granted by the Zoning
Officer in the event the applicant has shown good cause for the
delay.
A. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of a zoning ordinance or map or any portion thereof, which
prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an
interest, may submit a curative amendment to the governing body with
a written request that his challenge and proposed amendment be
heard. The governing body shall commence a hearing thereon within 60
days of the request as provided in § 84-137. The curative amendment
and challenge shall be referred to the Allegheny County Planning
Department and the Township Planning Commission and
Environmental Advisory Council for their recommendations.
B. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with this section.
C. If the governing body determines that the validity challenge has merit,
the governing body may accept the landowner's curative amendment,
with or without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment,
§ 84-137 PINE CODE § 84-138
68:800
§ 84-139. Municipal curative amendment.
The Township shall declare by formal action that its Zoning Chapter or
portions thereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days following such
declaration and proposal, the governing body shall:
which will cure the challenged defects. The governing body shall
consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory material
submitted by the landowner and shall consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of the proposed use on
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources, and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources, and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development, and any
adverse environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposed use on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses, which are essential to the public health and
welfare.
A. By resolution make significant findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of the Zoning Chapter, which may include:
(1) References to specific uses, which are either not permitted or not
permitted in sufficient quantity;
(2) Reference to a class of use or uses which require revision; or
(3) Reference to the entire chapter which requires revisions.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
municipality shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm
the validity of, its Zoning Chapter pursuant to the provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
C. Upon initiation of the procedures, as set forth in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, the governing body shall not be required
to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment, nor shall
the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report subsequent to
§ 84-138 SEWERS § 84-139
68:801
§ 84-140. Land development review.
§ 84-141. Variance.
the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical to or
substantially similar to those specified in the resolution. Upon
completion of the procedures as set forth in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, no rights to cure shall, from the date
of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis
of the subsequent invalidity of the amended Zoning Chapter for which
there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this section.
A. Authority. In considering the proposed development for purposes of
approving its location, land development and general character, the
Board of Supervisors and the Planning Commission shall apply the land
development regulations as outlined in Chapter 78 and shall further
review the said application from the standpoint and with the object of
promoting the community development goals as set forth in this
chapter.
B. Purpose. The purpose of requiring the submission of a land
development for review and approval prior to the issuance of any of the
permits and prior to the use and occupancy of any land, building or
structure for which the submission of an application is required, is to
assure the appropriate treatment of sites in accordance with certain
minimum standards of development outlined in this chapter.
C. Standards.
(1) Building permit, grading permit, street opening permit, or other
applicable permits shall be obtained for all development as
required by Township ordinance, state, or federal law.
(2) Uses permitted subject to land development review in each district
shall be subject to land development review as outlined in this
section.
(3) Conditional uses shall be required to follow the requirements of
this section.
(4) The provisions of these regulations shall be considered as the
minimum requirements for an approved land development.
D. Procedure. The owner or owners of land to be developed in any district
shall follow the land development review procedure outlined in Chapter
78 of the Township of Pine Code.
A. Authority. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the authority, in
accordance with the procedures hereinafter established, to authorize
use, area, or other variances within the Township of Pine. The variance
procedure is intended to provide a means by which relief may be
§ 84-139 PINE CODE § 84-141
68:802
granted only when no other applicable remedy, pursuant to other
provisions of this chapter, is available.
B. Purpose.
(1) Use variances. Use variance shall mean the authorization by the
Zoning Hearing Board for the use of land for a purpose that is
otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by the applicable zoning
regulations. A use variance is approved subject to specific plans,
terms, and conditions. Modification of such plans, terms, and
conditions shall require approval by the Zoning Hearing Board. The
Zoning Hearing Board shall have the authority to grant use
variances to restore structures damaged or destroyed or establish
a use of greater intensity as outlined in § 84-146.
(2) Area variances. Area variance shall mean the authorization by the
Zoning Hearing Board for the use of land in a manner that is not
permitted by regulations of this chapter related to:
(a) A dimension, such as size, height, and setbacks.
(b) Physical requirements of this chapter.
(c) The expansion, structural alteration, or enlargement of a
legally existing nonconforming use as outlined in § 84-130.
(d) The waiver of the additional requirements for conditional uses
for permitted uses set forth in Article V.
(e) Any design guideline outlined in Article VI.
C. Standards.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of the Zoning Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may grant a variance, provided that
all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given
case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Chapter and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
§ 84-141 SEWERS § 84-141
68:803
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this act and the Zoning Chapter.
D. Procedure. An application for a variance may be filed by the owner of,
or any other person having a contractual interest in, the subject
property.
(1) A public hearing shall be set, advertised, and conducted by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
(2) Within 45 days following the close of the public hearing, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall render its decision, approving or denying the
variance.
(3) If the Board finds in favor of the applicant, it may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards deemed necessary to
implement the purpose and intent of this chapter and the
Comprehensive Plan of the Township.
(4) Within five business days following such decision or the expiration
of such period, the Zoning Officer shall mail notice of such decision
or failure to act to all persons entitled to such notice and file such
decision in the office of the Township Clerk.
(5) Notice of hearings.
(a) Notice shall be given to the public, the applicant, the Zoning
Officer, such other persons as the governing body shall
designate, from time to time, by ordinance and to any other
person who has made a timely request for the same.
(b) Notices shall be sent mail at least five days prior to the date of
the hearing by first class mail.

general welfare of the Township; to have an adverse effect on the physical
and mental health of the residents, jeopardizing the safety of the areas
in which such commercial exploitation is permitted to occur; to have an

Adult-Oriented Establishments
[Adopted 8-2-1999 by Ord. No. 270]
§ 90-10. Legislative findings and intent.
A. Findings. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Pine finds as
follows:
(1) Adult-oriented establishments within the Township of Pine require
special regulation by law and the supervision by public safety
agencies in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and
welfare of patrons of such establishments, as well as the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Township of Pine.
(2) Statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of
communities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and in the
United States and by the State of Delaware indicate that:
(a) Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent adultoriented
establishments, especially those which provide closed
booths, cubicles, stalls, compartments, studios and rooms for
the private viewing of so-called adult motion pictures,
videotapes or live entertainment or a combination of such adult
motion pictures, videotapes and live entertainment;
(b) The closed booths, cubicles, stalls, compartments, studios and
rooms and holes in partitions between such booths, cubicles,
stalls, compartments, studios and rooms have been used by
patrons, clients or customers of adult-oriented establishments
for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts;
(c) Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such
adult-oriented establishments in order to provide sex for hire
to the patrons, clients or customers within the booths,
cubicles, stalls, compartments, studios and rooms;
(d) Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on
the entrances or exits, or both, of the booths, cubicles, stalls,
compartments, studios and rooms which are closed while the
booths, cubicles, stalls, compartments, studios and rooms are
in use encourage patrons using the booths, cubicles, stalls,
compartments, studios and rooms to engage in sexual acts in
the closures and through holes in partitions between the
closures with prostitutes, patrons, clients or customers,
thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the
commission of sexual acts which result in the direct exchange
of bodily fluids which put the participants at high risk for
contracting communicable diseases, including AIDS, and
which cause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on the
floors or walls, or both, of the booths, cubicles, stalls,

one of its principal business purposes, offers for sale books, films, video
cassettes or magazines and other periodicals which are distinguished or
compartments, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove
detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may
come in contact with such deposits; and
(e) The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adultoriented
establishments tend to discourage sexual acts and
prostitution and thereby promote the health, safety and
welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such
establishments.
(3) The unregulated operation of such adult-oriented establishments,
including, without limitation, those specifically cited in Subsection
A(1) above, is and would be detrimental to the general health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Township of Pine.
(4) The Constitution of Pennsylvania, the Home Rule Charter and
Optional Plans Law (53 P.S. § 1-101 et seq.135) and the Charter of
the Township of Pine grant to the Board of Supervisors of the
Township of Pine the power, especially police power, to enact
reasonable legislation to regulate and supervise adult-oriented
establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
B. Intent. It is not the intent of the Board of Supervisors of the Township of
Pine in enacting this article to deny to any person rights of speech
protected by the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
Pennsylvania, or both, nor is it the intent of the Board of Supervisors of
the Township of Pine to impose by this article any additional limitations
or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and other
materials. Further, by enacting this article, the Board of Supervisors of
the Township of Pine does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of

ARTICLE I
Earned Income Tax
[Adopted 12-28-1967 by Ord. No. 60149]
§ 128-1. Definitions.
The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning:

CURRENT YEAR  The calendar year for which the tax is levied.
DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his permanent home and

Domicile is the place in which a man has voluntarily fixed the habitation
of himself and his family, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but
with the present intention of making a permanent home, until some event
occurs to induce him to adopt some other permanent home. In the case
of businesses or associations, the domicile is that place considered as the
center of business affairs and the place where its functions are discharged.

the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No. 2), known as the "Tax Reform Code
of 1971,"150 and regulations in 61 Pa. Code Pt. I, Subpt. B, Art. V (relating
to personal income tax). Employee business expenses are allowable
deductions as determined under Article III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971.
The amount of any housing allowance provided to a member of the clergy
shall not be taxable as earned income.[Amended 12-1-2003 by Ord. No.

gross receipts tax return must be completed and filed, but no tax
payment is due if the total gross receipts are less than $10,000.
B. A business in operation in the Township for less than one full year prior
to the beginning of the tax year shall compute the tax liability on the
average monthly gross receipts transacted during the preceding year
multiplied by 12. The business gross receipts tax return must be filed on
or before April 15. The business gross receipts tax return must be
completed and filed, but no tax payment is due if the total gross receipts
are estimated to be less than $10,000.

receipts tax return must be filed within 40 days from the date of

event that the business discontinues or relocates before payment of the
tax becomes due for such tax year, the tax should be apportioned for
such tax year by dividing gross receipts of the preceding full calendar
year by 12 and then multiplying that number by the number of months
in business during that current tax year. The business gross receipts tax
return should have the supporting tax document of the preceding year
attached with the discontinuation or relocation date noted. The
business gross receipts tax return must be completed and filed, but no
tax payment is due if the total gross receipts are estimated to be less

granted, regardless of if a federal income tax extension has been applied for
or granted. If the gross receipts of the prior year are known, but the federal
tax return has not yet been filed, the business gross receipts tax return must
be filed on or before April 15, with tax payment, and a copy of the federal
application for extension of time to file a return attached. The supporting
documentation for the business gross receipts tax return must be sent at
the time the federal tax return is filed. If the gross receipts of the prior
year are unknown, the business gross receipts tax return must be filed on
or before April 15, with tax payment calculated using the preceding year's
gross receipts. An amended business gross receipts tax return must then be
filed, with supporting documentation, when the federal tax return is filed.
Payment of any additional tax is due with the amended return, including
penalty and interest on the amount of unpaid tax to the date of payment.
Refunds will be made by the Township if the actual gross receipts are less
than the tax paid with the original filing.
§ 128-30. Payment of tax at time of filing return.
Tax payment, as indicated on the completed business gross receipts tax
return, must be made with the filing of that return, including applicable
payment and interest.

gross receipts tax return if the business has been in operation in the
Township for at least one full year. Verification shall be provided through
attachment of page one of federal forms 1040, 1065, 1120, 1120S or
Schedules C, E, F or K-1.

three years of payment. Interest on the refund shall be paid at the same
rate and in the same manner as required pursuant to § 806 of the Act of

during the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter
otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and such 1/2 rate shall become
effective without any action on the part of Pine Township; provided,
however, that Pine Township and any other political subdivision which
impose such tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead
of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they

exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law,166 for and in respect to the
transaction or any part thereof, an additional tax at the rate of 1/2% of
the value of the real estate represented by such document, which tax
shall be payable solely to the Township of Pine at the earlier of the time
the document is presented for recording or within 30 days of
acceptance of such document or within 30 days of becoming an
acquired company. It is the intent of this subsection that the additional
tax of 1/2% imposed herein be and is imposed pursuant to the authority

an official stamp or writing by the Recorder wherein the date of the
payment of the taxes, the amount thereof and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.

effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu

year from the date of condemnation.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend

and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all

the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.

§ 128-68. Duty of employers to collect.
A. Every employer shall, within 15 days after the effective date of this
article or within 15 days of first becoming an employer thereafter,
register with the Collector the employer's name, address and such
other information as the Collector may require.
B. As to each taxpayer employed for any length of time during any payroll
period of an employer during the calendar year, each employer shall
deduct a pro-rata share of the tax from compensation payable to the
taxpayer with respect to such payroll period. The pro-rata share of the
tax assessed on a taxpayer for a payroll period shall be determined by
dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro-rata share of the tax, an employer shall
round down the amount of tax deducted for each payroll period to the
nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Each employer shall file a return on a form
prescribed by the Collector and pay the Collector the full amount of all
such taxes deducted during a calendar quarter within 30 days after the
end of the calendar quarter.

December 31 of any year shall, within 15 days after discontinuing
business or ceasing operation, file the return hereinabove required and

employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section or who fails to pay
such tax to the Collector, shall be liable for such tax in full as though the
tax had originally been levied against such employer. No employer shall
be liable for failure to deduct the tax if the failure to deduct the tax
arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal
office or where the employee is principally employed.
E. The employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate
records concerning the employees in the cases described in Subsection
E(1) and (2) below.

recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the
name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the

that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer
and that the employee will notify other employers of a change in
the principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence.
(2) In the case of an employee claiming the exemption set forth at
§ 128-67C, if the employee has provided an exemption certificate to
the employer, the Collector has not otherwise instructed the

§ 128-69. Self-employed individuals.
Every taxpayer who is self-employed, or whose tax for any other reason is
not collected under § 128-68 of this article, shall file a return on a form
prescribed by the Collector and shall pay a pro-rata share of the tax directly
employer, the employer has not received notification from the
person who claimed the exemption or from the Collector that the
person has received earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, and the employer has not paid to
the person earned income within the Township in an amount equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year.
(3) The employer shall file with the Collector a copy of each exemption
certificate, including attachments, received by the employer no
later than the end of the first payroll period as to which the
employee claims the exemption set forth at § 128-67C.
(4) If a person has claimed the exemption under § 128-67C for a given
calendar year from the tax but either the employer has received
notification from the person who claimed the exemption or from the
Collector that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the Township equal to or in excess of
$12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or the
employer has paid to the person earned income within the
Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, then the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year and the employer shall withhold
from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification described above or for the first payroll period after
payments described above have been made, a lump sum equal to
the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person, plus the per-payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
§ 128-68E(4) is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and
the Collector may pursue collection under this article.
(5) Each employer shall ensure that exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with an exemption certificate form at the time of

is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% per year on the amount of
unpaid tax and an additional penalty of 1/2 of 1% of the amount of unpaid
tax for each month or fraction of month during which the tax remains
unpaid, shall be added and collected. Whenever suit is brought for the
recovery of unpaid tax, the taxpayer shall, in addition, be liable for the costs
of collection (including but not limited to attorneys' fees), as well as for
interest and penalties. The Collector may accept payment under protest of
the tax claimed by the Township in any case where any person disputes the
Township's claim for the tax. If a court of competent jurisdiction thereafter
decides that there has been overpayment to the Collector, the Collector
shall refund the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid under
protest.

person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the
priority of claim to collect the tax shall be in the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.

has not been made.[Added 12-7-1998 by Res. No. 564]
§ A145-2. Imposition of tax.
A. The tax levied by the district shall be applicable to earned income
received and to net profits earned in the period beginning January l of
the current year and ending December 31 of the current year or for
taxpayer fiscal years beginning in the current year, except that taxes
imposed for the first time shall become effective from the date specified
in the ordinance or resolution, and the tax shall continue in force on a
calendar-year or taxpayer-fiscal-year basis, without annual
reenactment, unless the rate of the tax is subsequently changed.
Changes in rate shall become effective on the date specified in the
ordinance.
B. The entire earned income and net profits received and/or earned by a
resident or applicable nonresident of the taxing district is subject to the
tax. Neither the source of the earned income or net profits nor the place
where it is received and/or earned exempts a resident or applicable
nonresident from the tax.
C. Resident taxation.
(1) All residents of the Township of Pine are subject to the tax. A
"resident" is an individual who is domiciled in the taxing district as
evidenced by one or more of the following:
(a) By customarily being physically present, sleeping and eating
there.
(b) By maintaining religious, civic and club affiliations there.
(c) By holding oneself out as residing there, i.e., giving address or
registration for licenses, voting or payment of per capita,
personal property or income taxes.
(d) By spouse and minor children living there.
(e) By the center of affairs appearing to be there.
(2) Normally it is not difficult to determine the residence or domicile of
an individual because most of the determining factors usually point
to one conclusion. If a person has the foregoing factors occurring in
one district, he is a resident of the district. In more difficult
situations, each case must be determined solely on its own facts.
D. Nonresident taxation. [Amended 4-17-1995 by Res. No. 489]
(1) Nonresidents who are employed or who reside temporarily in the
Township of Pine are subject to the tax on earned income and net
profit received while employed or temporarily residing in the
§ A145-1 PINE CODE § A145-2
142:1082
district. Appropriate credit will be given to such nonresidents for
similar taxes paid to the jurisdiction in which they are domiciled to
the extent that such similar taxes are not used as a credit against
any other taxes payable by the nonresident.
(2) Nonresidents are not subject to taxation by the school district.
E. Taxable income. The tax is imposed on earned income and net profits as
both are defined in § A145-1 of these rules and regulations. These items
are subject to the tax whether a taxpayer receives them directly or
through an agent.

way to limit the provisions of the resolutions/ordinances to these
examples) are:
(1) Salaries.
(2) Wages.

(5) Contributions to deferred income plans, i.e., 401K, IRA, SEP and
other plans deferred from federal tax but subject to Pennsylvania
tax.
(6) Court awards to the extent that they represent back wages.
(7) Director's fees.
(8) Distributions (including interest earned) from a pension plan,
deferred payment programs and individual retirement accounts
other than by reason of death, disability, retirement upon reaching
a specific age or rollover to another deferred payment program to
the extent that they have not been previously taxed and as included
in compensation of the Pennsylvania tax return. [Amended
12-1-2003 by Res. No. 686]
(9) Drawing accounts. (If amounts received as a drawing account
exceed the salary or commissions earned, the tax is payable on the
amounts received. If the employee subsequently repays to the
employer any amounts not in fact earned, the tax shall be adjusted
accordingly but not below zero.)
(10) Early retirement payment incentives.
(11) Employer contributions to a cafeteria plan to the extent the
employee could have elected taxable benefits as included in
Pennsylvania wages, but excluding those contributions within a
qualified Section 125 Plan for hospitalization benefits; sickness,
disability, or death benefits; supplemental unemployment benefits;
or strike benefits. Contributions for payment of care for employee's
§ A145-2 WATER DISTRICTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF § A145-2
142:1083
dependents shall be included within the definition of "earned
income." [Amended 12-1-2003 by Res. No. 686]
(12) Executor's fees.
(13) Exercised stock options.
(14) Fees.

(27) Tips and gratuities.
(28) Vacation/holiday pay.

Res. No. 686]

I. Credit for tax paid to other states/municipalities.
(1) Where district residents are employed in another state and subject
to a state or local income tax at their place of employment, the
district will credit against their liability for any local taxes the
amount of tax paid out of state. The same dollar of the out-of-state
tax cannot be claimed as credit against liability for both state and
local taxes in Pennsylvania, but the credit can be divided and
apportioned against Pennsylvania state and local tax liability. Tax
payments made voluntarily to another state do not qualify for the
credit; there must be evidence that the taxpayer was legally liable
for the out-of-state taxes. This credit does not extend to taxes paid
to foreign countries. Credit for taxes paid to other states and
localities is limited to the amount payable to the district on that
portion of the taxpayer's income which was subject to taxation by
the other state.
(2) Taxpayers who wish to take credit for taxes paid to other
jurisdictions must complete a supplemental final return form,
which can be obtained from the tax office. Documentation must
include a notarized list of income earned in all jurisdictions along
with the respective taxes paid, a copy of the Pennsylvania
individual tax return and additional documentation as required.
J. Deductions.

necessary (required by the employer) in order for the taxpayer to
keep his present job, to the extent that they are allowable for state
income tax purposes on Pennsylvania Schedule UE which must be
submitted to allow deduction.
(2) Employee unreimbursed moving expense. Pennsylvania Schedule
UE or Federal Schedule 3903 must be submitted to allow
deduction.
K. Losses. [Amended 12-7-1998 by Res. No. 564]
(1) A business loss cannot be offset against earned income (W-2
wages). [Amended 6-15-2009 by Res. No. 801232]
(2) A business profit can be offset by a business loss. [Amended
6-15-2009 by Res. No. 801]

are not taxable items under the code.
(4) Rental losses cannot be used as an offset against earned income

any part of the preceding calendar year shall file with the Tax
Officer an annual tax return showing all earned income and net
profits received and/or earned for the previous year. Proof of
earnings is required. A copy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
income tax return, W-2 statements and net profit schedules must be
submitted. Failure to submit the required attachments and
schedules shall result in the annual tax return being invalid and
therefore considered not filed.
(2) If a person has no earned income to report, the word "none" shall
be entered on the annual tax return, and the return shall be signed,
dated and returned to the officer with an explanation (military
service, retired, disability income only, etc.).
(3) If self-employment profit is incurred, the type of business,
profession or enterprise shall be indicated on the annual tax return,
and the amount of the profit shall be shown on the appropriate line
of the return.
232. Editor's Note: This resolution also provided that it shall be effective for the tax year
commencing on 1-1-2009.
§ A145-2 PINE CODE § A145-3
142:1088
(4) When a return is made for a fiscal year, the return shall be filed
within 105 days from the end of said fiscal year.

places of employment or business, the amount of tax due, the
amount of any credit claimed for tax withheld by an employer (with
a copy of the withholding statement showing the amount of tax
withheld) and such other information as may be indicated on the
return form or as may be required by the Officer(s). Every person
subject to the tax shall file such return, regardless of the fact that
his wages may have been subject to withholding of the tax by his
employer and regardless of whether or not tax is due.
(6) At the time of filing the annual return, the taxpayer shall pay any
tax due. Total balances less than $1 need not be paid. In the case of
overpayment, request for refund of amounts over $10 or a credit

copy of the federal or Pennsylvania application for extension of
time to file shall be required, along with payment of any estimated
additional tax due, by the annual filing due date. Upon filing of the

E. Changes in taxable income. If the amount of a taxpayer's earned income
or net profits reported on his annual federal or Pennsylvania tax return
is changed or corrected, either by action of the Internal Revenue
Service or the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue or by the
individual's filing of an amended annual federal or state return, the
taxpayer shall report to the appropriate officer such change or
correction within 30 days after the date when the final such change or
correction was determined.
A. Employers required to withhold. Every employer having an office,
factory, workshop, branch, warehouse or other place of business
located within the taxing district and who employs one or more persons
(other than domestic servants in a private home) for a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation shall deduct the tax from the
resident and applicable nonresident employee's wages at the time of
payment thereof.
B. Voluntary withholding. Any employer located outside the taxing district
may voluntarily withhold the tax from employees who are residents or
applicable nonresidents of the taxing district but who are employed
outside the district.

authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any
taxpayer or supposed taxpayer or of any employer or supposed
employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due, if any. Every taxpayer or
supposed taxpayer and every employer or supposed employer is
required to give the Officer(s) or any agent so designated by him
the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination and

provided by law.
D. Records to be kept by taxpayers. Taxpayers and employers subject to

enable the filing of true and accurate returns, whether of taxes withheld
at source or of taxes payable upon earned income or net profits, or
both; and such records shall be preserved for a period of not less than
six years in order to enable the Tax Officer(s) or his agent to verify the

credited within 75 days of either April 15 of the succeeding year if the
final return and full verification is filed by then or the date of filing a
final return and full verification if it occurs after April 15 of the
succeeding year, then no interest shall be allowed on the overpayment.

collection and interest and penalties herein imposed.
H. Suit for collection of tax.
(1) The Officer(s) may sue in the name of the taxing district for the
recovery of taxes due and unpaid under the ordinance.
(2) Any suit brought to recover the tax imposed pursuant to the
regulations shall be begun within three years after such tax is due

whichever date is later; provided, however, that this limitation shall
not prevent the institution of a suit for the collection of any tax due
or determined to be due in the following cases:

return was filed by any person although a declaration or return
was required to be filed by him under provisions of the
ordinance or resolution, there shall be no limitation.

person or of other evidence relating to such declaration or

or more and no fraud, suit shall be begun within six years.

so deducted to the Officer(s) or where any person has willfully
failed or omitted to make the deductions required by the
regulations, there shall be no limitation.

from recovering delinquent taxes by any other means provided
by Pennsylvania Act 511.

provided that such suit is begun two years after making such
refund, except that the suit may be brought within five years if

ARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 101. Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the " Township of Pine Stormwater Management Ordinance."
Section 102. Statement of Findings
The governing body of the Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed
increases runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of waterresources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management ( SWM), including regulation of development and activities
causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of people of
the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports
the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure ( GI) and low impact development ( LID) are intended to address the root cause of
water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/ or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure
practices and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of pre- development hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls. These
municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( NPDES) program.
Section 103. Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the Municipality and its watershed by
minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in Section 102 of this Ordinance, through provisions
designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect
water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best management practices ( BMPs) that are
implemented within the Township.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
A- 4
Section 104. Statutory Authority
The Township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968,
P. L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/ or the Act of October 4, 1978,
P. L. 864 ( Act 167), 32 P. S. Section 680. 1, et seq., as amended, The Stormwater Management Act.
Section 105. Applicability
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff, including land development and earth
disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this Ordinance. All activities related to proper operation and
maintenance of approved stormwater management BMPs and all activities that may contribute non- stormwater
discharges to a regulated small MS4 are subject to regulation by this Ordinance.
Section 106. Repealer
Any other ordinance provision( s) or regulation of the Township inconsistent with any of the provisions of this
Ordinance is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 108. Compatibility with Other Requirements
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Ordinance do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure
required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
Section 109. Erroneous Permit
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an
applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established
pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of
the Township purporting to validate such a violation.
Section 110. Waivers
A. If the Township determines that any requirement under this Ordinance cannot be achieved for a particular
regulated activity the Township may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Ordinance, subject to Section 110, paragraph B. The proposed area of disturbance shall be less than one( 1)
acre. The request for a modification or waiver shall originate with the Landowner, shall be in writing, and shall
accompany the Stormwater Management Site Plan submitted to the Township. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provisions of the Ordinance involved, and the proposed modification. The
Designated Plan Reviewer shall review the request to determine if it meets the requirements of the Ordinance,
including paragraph B below. If acceptable to the Township, the Township may grant the waiver or modification.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Ordinance may be approved by the Township if enforcement
will exact undue hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the land in question,
provided that the modifications will not be contrary or detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome, and that the purpose of the Ordinance is preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical
circumstances or conditions and not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the
Stormwater Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications
shall not substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property. A request
for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the Stormwater Management Site Plan submission, as directed
in Section 110, paragraph A above.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to
one ( 1) acre may be granted by the Township.
A- 5
D. This Section shall not apply to requests for waiver or modification to the provisions of Section V Design Criteria.
All requests for waivers or modifications from Section V shall be reviewed by the Township for applications of any
size earth disturbance.
Section 111. Version of Regulations and Standards
Any reference to a statute, regulation or standard, shall be interpreted to refer to the latest or most current version of
that document.
Section 112. Disclaimer of Liability
A. For regulatory purposes, the degree of stormwater management sought by the provisions of this Chapter is
considered reasonable. This Chapter shall not impose upon the Township any legal duty in addition to those duties
otherwise imposed under the Stormwater Management Act upon the Township, any appointed or elected official,
employee or representative of the Township. It is not the intention of the Township to guarantee the elimination of
harm resulting from stream flow, floods, rain, snow, or stormwater runoff; or erosion resulting therefrom. It is the
intention of the Township to create reasonable stormwater management regulations which balance several
competing interests in an appropriate fashion with the emphasis on public safety.
B. This Chapter does not imply that areas within or outside any identified flood- prone area will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
C. Neither the granting of any approval under this Ordinance, nor the compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance,
or with any condition imposed by the Township or a Township official hereunder, shall relieve any person from any
responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose
any liability upon the Township for damages to person or property.
D. The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management facilities shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the Township, or by an official, employee, or consultant thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use, or other plan proposed, and shall create no liability upon or cause of
action against the Township, or an official, employee, or consultant thereof, for any damage that may result
pursuant thereto.

replaced from time to time by DEP).
Floodway  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably
required to carry and discharge the 100- year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as
indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100- year floodway, it is assumed-- absent evidence to the contrary-- that the floodway
extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.

promote the use of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter,
evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large- scale conveyance and treatment
systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost- effective landscape features located on- site.

ARTICLE III - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
Section 301. General Requirements
A. For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM Site Plan is specifically exempted in Section 302:
1. Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM Site Plan is required.
2. No regulated activities shall commence until the Township issues written approval of an SWM Site Plan,
which demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
B. SWM Site Plans approved by the Township, in accordance with Section 406, shall be on site throughout the
duration of the regulated activity.
C. These standards apply to the landowner and any person engaged in regulated activities.
D. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities ( e. g., during construction) to meet the
purposes and requirements of this Ordinance and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania
Code and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual( E& S Manual4), No. 363- 2134- 008, as amended and updated. Comment on the
adequacy of the Erosion and Sedimentation Controls may be provided by the Township per the requirements of
Allegheny County Conservation District. Erosion and Sedimentation Control provisions shall be as follows:
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall commence until approval by the Township
of an erosion and sediment control plan for construction activities.
2. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP) has regulations that require an erosion and
sediment control plan for any earth disturbance activity of 5, 000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa. Code §
102. 4( b).
3. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES Construction Activities permit is required for any
earth disturbance of one acre or more with a point source discharge to surface waters or the Township' s storm
sewer system, or five acres or more regardless of the planned runoff ( hereinafter collectively referred to as
regulated earth disturbance activities"). This includes earth disturbance on any portion of, part of, or during
any stage of, a larger common plan of development.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit( s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP
regional office or Allegheny County Conservation District must be provided to the Township. The issuance of
an NPDES Construction Permit[ or permit coverage under the statewide General Permit( PAG- 2)] satisfies this
requirement.
5. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall
be available at the project site at all times.
E. Impervious areas:
1. The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the impervious areas in the total proposed
development even if development is to take place in stages.
2. For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan must be used in determining conformance
with this Ordinance.
3. For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total impervious area on the parcel is subject to the
requirements of this Ordinance; except that the volume controls in Section 303 and the peak rate controls of
Section 304 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
A- 12
F. Regulated stormwater flows onto adjacent or downstream property shall not be created, increased, decreased,
relocated, impeded, or otherwise altered without written notification of the affected property owner( s). Notification
shall include a description of the proposed development and the stormwater flows that are being created,
increased, decreased, relocated, impeded, or otherwise altered. Adjacent property shall at a minimum include any
property having a shared boundary with the subject property of the SWM Site Plan, however, if in the judgement
of the Designated Plan Reviewer additional properties are being affected, additional notifications may be required.
Proof of notification ( signed postal receipt for example) shall be included as part of the SWM Plan submission to
the Township. Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Ordinance.
G. All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
1. Protect health, safety, and property.
2. Meet the water quality goals of this Ordinance by implementing measures to:
a. Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas.
b. Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
c. Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
d. Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this Commonwealth.
e. Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious areas, wherever possible.
3. Incorporate methods described in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual ( BMP
Manual3). If methods other than green infrastructure and LID methods are proposed to achieve the volume
and rate controls required under this Ordinance, the SWM Site Plan must include a detailed justification,
acceptable to the Designated Plan Reviewer, demonstrating that the use of LID and green infrastructure is not
practicable.
H. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the project site at strategic locations, made as shallow as
practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on- site infiltration features while still meeting the other
requirements of this Ordinance.
I. Normally dry, open top, storage facilities should completely drain both the volume control and rate control
capacities over a period of time not less than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
Infiltration tests performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP
Manual, must support time- to- empty calculations if infiltration is a factor.
J. The design storm precipitation depths to be used in the analysis of peak rates of discharge shall be as obtained in
PennDOT' s Drainage Manual, Publication 584, Appendix 7A; or obtained from the latest version of the
Precipitation- Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA),
National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA' s Atlas
145 can be accessed at: http:// hdsc. nws. noaa. gov/ hdsc/ pfds/.
K. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the
purposes and requirements of this Ordinance and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania
Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm Water Management Act.
L. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual3.
M. The Township may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures for meeting the state water quality
requirements other than those in this Ordinance, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not
conflict with, state law including, but not limited to, the Clean Streams Law.

specifications of the materials to be used for stormwater management facilities.
b. An erosion and sediment control plan, including all reviews and letters of adequacy from the
Conservation District where appropriate.
c. Limits of earth disturbance, including the type and amount of impervious area that is proposed;
proposed structures, roads, paved areas, and buildings; and a statement, signed by the Applicant,
acknowledging that any revision to the approved drainage plan must be approved by the Township,
and that a revised erosion and sediment control plan must be submitted to the Township or
Conservation District for approval.
d. All stormwater management facilities must be located on a plan and described in detail; and all
calculations, assumptions, and criteria used in the design of the stormwater management facilities
must be shown.
C. Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM Site Plan preparation requirements of this Ordinance provided the
activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
D. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM Site Plan preparation requirements of this
Ordinance provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter102.
E. Roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects, which do not increase impervious area, and underground
infrastructure projects are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance, provided the activities meet the
requirements of all other Municipal, State and Federal requirements. Exemptions from any provisions of this
Ordinance shall not relieve the applicant from the requirements in Sections 301. D. through J.
F. The Township may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this Section at any time for any project that the
Township believes may pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
G. Voluntary Green Stormwater Infrastructure ( GSI) retrofit projects that are solely intended to better manage runoff
from existing development and are not part of new development or redevelopment, are exempt from the stormwater
management provisions of this Ordinance. This does not exempt such projects from any other municipal, state, or
federal regulation.
Section 303. Volume Controls
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual3 shall be utilized for all
regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below, or alternative design criteria as
allowed by PA Code Title 25, Chapter 102.
A. The Design Storm Method( CG- 1 in the BMP Manual3) is applicable as a method to any size of regulated activity.
This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions. The following shall be incorporated into the CG1 method:
1. Do not increase the post- development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the 2- year 24- hour
duration precipitation.
2. At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed
from the runoff flow, i. e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the
listed removal options are not feasible, and the Designated Plan Reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in
a facility designed for a 48 to 72 hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated stormwater system ( not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility designed for a 72 hour dewatering
A- 14
time in an area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the
environment. Justification, as prepared and sealed by a qualified professional, for assertion that permanent
removal is not feasible must be provided, at a minimum, in the form of field measured infiltration rate testing
and geotechnical evaluation of the existing site soils with regard to the impact of proposed infiltration.
Applications omitting this justification, including infiltration rate testing will be considered incomplete. BMPs
proposing use of extended detention in lieu of permanent reduction through the listed methods shall include a
valve to adjust or regulate dewatering time to achieve the performance standards noted herein. The valve
system shall include an inspection/ monitoring port for review of dewatering.
3. For modeling purposes:
a. Existing ( predevelopment) non- forested pervious areas must be considered meadow in good condition.
b. 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition in the
model for existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method( CG- 2 in the BMP Manual3) provided below is independent of site conditions and should be
used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than
one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
1. Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two ( 2) inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious
surfaces.
2. At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed
from the runoff flow, i. e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the
listed removal options are not feasible, and the Designated Plan Reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in
a facility designed for a 24 hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated stormwater system ( not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility designed for a 72 hour dewatering
time in an area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the
environment.
3. Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire
permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0. 5 inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated.
4. This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 304, Rate Controls, if the project qualifies for exemption
by the provisions of Section 302.A.
Section 304. Rate Controls
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
Post- development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre- development discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-
50-, and 100- year, 24- hour storm events. This is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to
those rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix A ( Release Rate Management Districts). This Predevelopment to Post- development control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the " Conditional Direct
Discharge" areas on the Release Rate maps. For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second ( cfs). If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post- development
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the pre- development analysis for 1-, 2-,
5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100- year, 24- hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak
flows should be computed using the methods included in the Chapter titled " Stormwater Calculations and
Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
For the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100- year, 24- hour storm events, the post- development peak discharge rates
will follow the applicable approved release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A ( Release Rate
Management Districts) of this Ordinance For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth of a
cubic foot per second ( cfs). For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the post- development discharge
A- 15
rates shall not exceed the pre- development discharge rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
Section 305. Riparian Buffers
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a Riparian Buffer Easement shall be created and recorded as part of
any subdivision or land development that encompasses a Riparian Buffer. The intent of this ordinance in
establishing a Riparian Buffer is to protect and improve stream water quality. The Riparian Buffer is intended to
slow overland flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and shrubs, allowing
infiltration/ groundwater recharge; causing deposition of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the
buffer rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream bank stabilization. The trees provide
shade for streams; keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. Except as required by PA Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be required for all streams
as defined in Article II) with a contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The Riparian Buffer Easement
shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank ( on each side).
C. Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
1. No use or construction within the Riparian Buffer shall be permitted that is inconsistent with the intent of the
Riparian Buffer as described in Section 305. A.
2. Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within the Riparian Buffer Easement.
3. Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively removed and the Riparian Buffer Easement shall
be planted with native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community
appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
D. The Riparian Buffer Easement shall be enforceable by the Township and shall be recorded in the appropriate
County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by Zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
E. Any permitted use within the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent
of the existing 100- year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect the ecological
function of the floodplain.
F. Roadway crossings, when authorized by PA Chapter 105 Permitting as issued by DEP and stormwater drainage
pipes shall be permitted within the Riparian Buffer Easement, but they shall cross the Easement in the shortest
practical distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not permitted within the Riparian Buffer
Easement.
G. The following conditions shall apply when public and/ or private recreation trails are permitted by the Township
within Riparian Buffers:
1. It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for non- motorized use only; however, impermeable
trails are permitted provided they have adequate drainage
2. Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant species and other sensitive environmental
features.
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted within the Riparian Buffer Easement and
shall comply with setback requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the Riparian Buffer Easement; however, work shall be performed to
minimize disturbance area and removal of trees. Restoration within the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be with
native species of trees, grasses, and other plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a Registered Professional with the requisite experience. Aboveground utilities
shall only be permitted to cross the Easement perpendicular to the Easement or in the shortest practical distance.
Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as required.

SMALL PROJECT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN GUIDANCE
This small project stormwater site plan has been developed to assist those proposing residential projects to
meet the requirements of the Allegheny County Stormwater Management Plan Model Ordinance without
having to hire professional services to draft a formal stormwater management plan. This small project site
plan is only permitted for projects with earth disturbances between one-twentieth( 0. 05) acre and one quarter
0. 25) acre of earth disturbance( Section 302. B) and using The Simplified Method( CG- 2 in the BMP Manual3)
for Volume Control as described in Section 303. B. Additional information can be found in Chapter 6 ofthe
Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Applicants proposing use of this
methodology shall complete and submit for review a Small Development Stormwater Management Plan
Application, as included herein.
A. What is an applicant required to submit?
All requirements of Section 302. B including a brief description of the proposed stormwater facilities,
including types of materials to be used, total square footage of proposed impervious areas, volume
calculations, and a simple sketch plan showing the following information:
Location of proposed structures, driveways, or other paved areas with approximate surface area in
square feet.
Location of any existing or proposed onsite septic system and/ or potable water wells showing
proximity to infiltration facilities.
County Conservation District erosion and sediment control " Adequacy" letter as may be required by
Municipal, County or State regulations.
B. Determination of Required Volume Control and Sizing Stormwater Facilities
By following the simple steps outlined below in the provided example, an applicant can determine the runoff
volume that is required to be controlled and how to choose the appropriate stormwater facility to permanently
remove the runoff volume from the site. Impervious area calculations must include all areas on the lot
proposed to be covered by roof area or pavement which would prevent rain from naturally percolating into
the ground, including impervious surfaces such as sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, patios or swimming
pools. Sidewalks, driveways or patios that are designed and constructed to allow for infiltration are not
included in this calculation.
Site Plan Example: Controlling runoff volume from a proposed home site
Step 1: Determine Total Impervious Surfaces
Impervious Surface Area ( sq. ft.)
House Roof( Front) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
House Roof( Rear) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
Garage Roof( Left) 6ft. x 24 ft. = 144 sq. ft.
Garage Roof( Right) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 sq. ft.
Driveway 12 ft. x 50 ft. = 1000 sq. ft.
Walkway 4 ft. x 20 ft. = 80 sq. ft.
Total Imp. 3000 sq. ft.

Step 2: Determine Required Volume Control ( cubic feet) using the following equation:
Volume ( cu. ft.) = (Total impervious area in square feet x 2 inches of runoff) / 12 inches
3, 000 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff)/ 12 inches = 500 cu. ft.
A-31
Example continued:
Step 3: Sizing the Selected Volume Control BMP
Several Best Management Practices ( BMPs), as described below, are suitable for small stormwater
management projects. However, their application depends on the volume required to be controlled, how much
land is available, and the site constraints. Proposed residential development activities can apply both
nonstructural and structural BMPs to control the volume of runoff from the site. A number of different
volume control BMPs are described below. Note that Figure 1 is an example of how these BMPs can be
utilized in conjunction to control the total required volume on one site.
Structural BMPs
1. Infiltration Trench
An Infiltration Trench is a linear stormwater BMP consisting of a continuously perforated pipe at a minimum
slope in a stone- filled trench. During small storm events, infiltration trenches can significantly reduce volume
and serve in the removal of fine sediments and pollutants. Runoff is stored between the stones and infiltrates
through the bottom of the facility and into the soil matrix. Runoff should be pretreated using vegetative buffer
strips or swales to limit the amount of coarse sediment entering the trench which can clog and render the
trench ineffective. In all cases, an infiltration trench should be designed with a positive overflow.
Design Considerations:
Although the width and depth can vary, it is recommended that Infiltration Trenches be limited in
depth to not more than six ( 6) feet of stone.
Trench is wrapped in nonwoven geotextile ( top, sides, and bottom).
Trench needs to be placed on uncompacted soils.
Slope ofthe Trench bottom should be level or with a slope no greater than 1%.
A minimum of 6" of topsoil is placed over trench and vegetated.
The discharge or overflow from the Infiltration Trench should be properly designed for anticipated
flows.
Cleanouts or inlets should be installed at both ends ofthe Infiltration Trench and at appropriate
intervals to allow access to the perforated pipe.
Volume of facility = Depth x Width x Length x Void Space of the gravel bed ( assume 40%).
Maintenance:
Catch basins and inlets should be inspected and cleaned at least two times a year.
The vegetation along the surface ofthe infiltration trench should be maintained in good condition and
any bare spots should be re- vegetated as soon as possible.
Vehicles should not be parked or driven on the trench and care should be taken to avoid soil
compaction by lawn mowers.

Sizing Example for Infiltration Trench
1. Determine Total Impervious Surface to drain to Infiltration Trench:
Garage Roof( Left) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 sq. ft.
Driveway 12 ft. x 50 ft. = 1000 sq. ft.
Walkway 4 ft. x 20 ft. = 80 sq. ft.
2. Determine the required infiltration volume:
1224 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff)/ 12 ft. = 204 cu. ft. / 0. 4* = 510 cu. ft.
0. 4 assumes 40% void ratio in gravel bed)
3. Sizing the infiltration trench facility:
Volume ofFacility = Depth x Width x Length
Set Depth to 3 feet and determine required surface area of trench.
510 cu. ft. / 3 ft. = 170 sq. ft.
The width of the trench should be greater than 2 times its depth ( 2 x D), therefore in this example
the trench width of 6 feet selected.

Determine trench length: L= 170 sq. ft. / 6 ft. = 28. 3 ft.
Final infiltration trench dimensions: 3 ft. (D) x 6ft. (W) x 28. 3 ft. (L)
2. Rain Garden
A Rain Garden is a planted shallow depression designed to catch and filter rainfall runoff. The garden
captures rain from a downspout or a paved surface. The water sinks into the ground, aided by deep rooted
plants that like both wet and dry conditions. The ideal location for a rain garden is between the source of 
runoff( roofs and driveways) and the runoff destination ( drains, stream, low spots, etc.).
Design Considerations:
A maximum of 3: 1 side slope is recommended.
The depth of a rain garden can range from 6 - 8 inches. Ponded water should not exceed 6 inches.
The rain garden should drain within 72 hours.
The garden should be at least 10- 20 feet from a building' s foundation and 25 feet from septic system
drainfields and wellheads.
If the site has clay soils, soil should be amended with compost or organic material.
Choose native plants. See http:// pa. audubon. org/ habitat/ PDFs/ RGBrochure complete. pdf for a
native plant list. To find native plant sources go to www.pawildflower. org.
At the rain garden location, the water table should be at least 2' below the soil level. If water stands
in an area for more than one day after a heavy rain you can assume it has a higher water table and is
not a good choice for a rain garden.
Maintenance:
Water plants regularly until they become established.
Inspect twice a year for sediment buildup, erosion and vegetative conditions.
Mulch with hardwood when erosion is evident and replenish annually.
Prune and remove dead vegetation in the spring season.
Weed as you would any garden.
Move plants around if some plants would grow better in the drier or wetter parts ofthe garden.

Sizing Example for Rain Garden
1. Pick a site for the rain garden between the source of runoff and a low lying area, a.k.a., a drainage
area.
A-34
2. Perform an infiltration test to determine the depth ofthe rain garden:
Dig a hole 8" x 8"
Fill with water and put a popsicle stick at the top of the water level.
Measure how far it drains down after a few hours ( ideally 4 hours).
Calculate the depth of water that will drain out over 24 hours.
3. Determine total impervious surface area to drain to rain garden:
House Roof( Front) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
4. Sizing the rain garden:
For this example, let' s say the infiltration test determined 6" of water drained out of a hole in 24 hours.
The depth ofthe rain garden should be set to the results of the infiltration test so 6" is the depth of the
rain garden. The sizing calculation below is based on controlling 1" of runoff. First divide the
impervious surface by the depth of the rain garden.
672 sq. ft. / 6 ( depth of rain garden in inches) = 112 sq. ft.
In order to control 2" of runoff volume, the rain garden area is multiplied by 2.
112 sq. ft. * 2 = 224 sq. ft.
The rain garden should be about 225 sq. ft. in size and 6" deep.
3. Dry Well (a. k.a., Seepage Pit)
A Dry Well, sometimes called a Seepage Pit, is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily stores and
infiltrates stormwater runoff from the roofs of structures. By capturing runoff at the source, Dry Wells can
dramatically reduce the increased volume of stormwater generated by the roofs of structures. Roof leaders
connect directly into the Dry Well, which may be either an excavated pit filled with uniformly graded
aggregate wrapped in geotextile, or a prefabricated storage chamber or pipe segment. Dry Wells discharge
the stored runoff via infiltration into the surrounding soils. In the event that the Dry Well is overwhelmed in
an intense storm event, an overflow mechanism ( surcharge pipe, connection to a larger infiltration are, etc.)
will ensure that additional runoff is safely conveyed downstream.
Design Considerations:
Dry Wells typically consist of 18 to 48 inches of clean washed, uniformly graded aggregate with 40%
void capacity ( AASHTO No. 3, or similar). " Clean" gravel fill should average one and one- half to
three ( 1. 5  3. 0) inches in diameter.
Dry Wells are not recommended when their installation would create a significant risk for basement
seepage or flooding. In general, 10 - 20 feet of separation is recommended between Dry Wells and
building foundations.
The facility may be either a structural prefabricated chamber or an excavated pit filled with aggregate.
Depth of dry wells in excess of three- and- a- half( 3. 5) feet should be avoided unless warranted by soil
conditions.
Stormwater dry wells must never be combined with existing, rehabilitated, or new septic system
seepage pits. Discharge of sewage to stormwater dry wells is strictly prohibited.
As shown in Figure 5, the installation should include a surcharge or overflow pipe.
A- 35
Maintenance:
Dry wells should be inspected at least four( 4) times annually as well as after large storm events.
Remove sediment, debris/ trash, and any other waste material from a dry well.
Regularly clean out gutters and ensure proper connections to the dry well.
Replace the filter screen that intercepts the roof runoff as necessary.

Sizing Example for Dry Wells:
1. Determine contributing impervious surface area:
House Roof( Rear) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
2. Determine required volume control:
672 sq. ft. x ( 2 inches of runoff/ 12 inches/ ft.) = 112 cu. ft.
112 cu ft. / 0. 4 = 280 cu. ft. ( assuming the 40% void ratio in the gravel bed)
3. Sizing the dry well:
Set the depth to 3. 5 ft.; Set the width equal to the length for a square chamber.
3. 5 ft. x L x L = 280 cu. ft.; LxL = 280 cu. ft. / 3. 5 ft.; thus LxL= 80 sq. ft.; L=9 ( approx)
Dimensions = 3. 5 ft. (D) x 9ft. (L) x 9 ft. (W)

NonStructural BMPs
1. Tree Plantings and Preservation
Trees and forests reduce stormwater runoff by capturing and storing rainfall in the canopy and releasing water
into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Tree roots and leaf litter also create soil conditions that
promote the infiltration of rainwater into the soil. In addition, trees and forests reduce pollutants by taking up
nutrients and other pollutants from soils and water through their root systems. A development site can reduce
runoff volume by planting new trees or by preserving trees which existed on the site prior to development.
The volume reduction calculations either determine the cubic feet to be directed to the area under the tree
canopy for infiltration or determine a volume reduction credit which can be used to reduce the size of any
one of the planned structural BMPs on the site.
Tree Considerations:
Existing trees must have at least a 4" trunk caliper or larger.
Existing tree canopy must be within 100 ft. of impervious surfaces.
A tree canopy is classified as the continuous cover of branches and foliage formed by a single tree
or collectively by the crowns of adjacent trees.
New tree plantings must be at least 6 ft. in height and have a 2" trunk caliper.
All existing and newly planted trees must be native to Pennsylvania. See_
http:// www. dcnr. state. pa.us/ forestry/ commontr/ commontrees. pdf for a guide book titled Common
Trees ofPennsylvania for a native tree list.
When using trees as volume control BMPs, runoff from impervious areas should be directed to
drain under the tree canopy.
Determining the required number of planted trees to reduce the runoff volume:
1. Determine contributing impervious surface area:
Garage Roof( Right) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 ft.
2. Calculate the required control volume:
144 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff)/ 12 inches = 24 cu. ft.
3. Determine the number of tree plantings:
A newly planted deciduous tree can reduce runoff volume by 6 cu. ft.
A newly planted evergreen tree can reduce runoff volume by 10 cu. ft.
24 cu. ft. / 6 cu. ft. = 4 Deciduous Trees
Determining the volume reduction for preserving existing trees:
1. Calculate approximate area ofthe existing tree canopy:
22 sq. ft. x23 sq. ft. = 500 sq. ft.
2. Measure distance from impervious surface to tree canopy: 35 ft.
A- 37
3. Calculate the volume reduction credit by preserving existing trees:
For Trees within 20 feet of impervious cover:
Volume Reduction cu. ft. = (Existing Tree Canopy sq. ft. x 1 inch) / 12
For Trees beyond 20 feet but not farther than 100 feet from impervious cover:
Volume Reduction cu. ft. = (Existing Tree Canopy sq. ft. x 0. 5 inch)/ 12
500 sq. ft. x 0. 5 inches)/ 12 = 21 cu. ft.
This volume credit can be utilized in reducing the size of any one of the structural BMPs planned on
the site. For example, the 21 cu. ft. could be subtracted from the required infiltration volume when
sizing the infiltration trench;
510 cu. ft. - 21 cu. ft. = 489 cu. ft.
489 cu. ft. / 3 ft. (Depth) = 163 / 6 ft. (Width) = 27. 1 ft. (Length)
Using the existing trees for a volume credit would decrease the length of the infiltration trench to 27. 1
ft. instead of 28. 3 ft.
2. Minimize Soil Compaction and Replant with Lawn or Meadow
When soil is overly compacted during construction it can cause a drastic reduction in the permeability of the
soil and rarely is the soil profile completely restored. Runoff from vegetative areas with highly compacted
soils similarly resembles runoff from an impervious surface. Minimizing soil compaction and re- planting
with a vegetative cover like meadow or lawn, not only increases the infiltration on the site, but also creates a
friendly habitat for a variety of wildlife species.
Design Considerations:
Area shall not be stripped of topsoil.
Vehicle movement, storage, or equipment/material lay down shall not be permitted in areas
preserved for minimum soil compaction.
The use of soil amendments and additional topsoil is permitted.
Meadow should be planted with native grasses. Refer to Meadows and Prairies: WildlifeFriendly Alternatives to Lawn at http:// pubs. causu. edu/ FreePubs/ pdfs/ UH128. pdf for
reference on how to properly plant the meadow and for a list of native species.
Determining the volume reduction by minimizing soil compaction and planting a meadow:
1. Calculate approximate area of preserved meadow:
22 sq. ft. x- 23 sq. ft. = 500 sq. ft.
A- 38
2. Calculate the volume reduction credit by minimizing the soil compaction and planting a
lawn/ meadow:
For Meadow Areas: Volume Reduction ( cu. ft.) _ (Area of Min. Soil Compaction ( sq. ft.) x
1/ 3 inch of runoff) / 12
500 sq. ft. x 1/ 3 inch of runoff) / 12 = 13. 8 cu. ft.
For Lawn Areas: Volume Reduction ( cu. ft.) = ( Area of Min. Soil Compaction ( sq. ft.) x 1/ 4
inch of runoff)/ 12
500 sq. ft. x 1/ 4 inch of runoff) / 12 = 10. 4 cu. ft.
This volume credit can be used to reduce the size of any one of the structural BMPs on the site. See
explanation under the volume credit for preserving existing trees for details.
Alternative BMP to Capture and Reuse Stormwater
Rain Barrels
Rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be
released to lawns, gardens, and other landscaped areas after the rainfall has ended. Rain barrels are typically
between 50 and 200 gallons in size. It is not recommended for rain barrels to be used as a volume control
BMP because infiltration is not guaranteed after each storm event. For this reason, a rain barrel is not utilized
in the site plan example. However, the information is included to provide an alternative for a homeowner to
utilize when considering capture and reuse stormwater methods.
Design Considerations:
Rain barrels should be directly connected to the roof gutter/spout.
There must be a means to release the water stored between storm events to provide the necessary
storage volume for the next storm.
When calculating rain barrel size, rain barrels are typically assumed to be 25% full because they are
not always emptied before the next storm.
Use screens to filter debris and cover lids to prevent mosquitoes.
An overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top with an overflow pipe to divert flow
away from structures.
It is possible to use a number of rain barrels jointly for an area.

Sizing Example for a Rain Barrel
1. Determine contributing impervious surface area:
Garage Roof( Right) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 sq. ft.
2. Determine the amount of rainfall to be captured by the Rain Barrel. A smaller storm, no more than
2", is recommended to calculate the runoff to be captured. This example chose the 1" storm event.
3. Calculate the volume to be captured and reused:
144 sq. ft. x 1 inch of runoff) / 12 inches = 12 cu. ft.
4. Size the rain barrel:
1 cu. ft. = 7. 48 gallons
12 cu. ft. x 7. 48 = 90 gallons
90 gallons x ( 0.25*) = 22. 5 gallons (* assuming that the rain barrel is always at least 25% full)
90 gallons + 22. 5 gallons = 112 gallons
The rain barrel or barrels should be large enough to hold at least 112 gallons ofwater.
