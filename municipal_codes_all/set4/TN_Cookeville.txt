PREFACE
   The Cookeville Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Cookeville, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the
origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the
historical citation indicates significant modification of the original
ordinance.
   The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter is
kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first
digit, followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit
identifies the chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section
number. For example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-
106.
   By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations
included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code
relating to any question that might arise. However, the user should note that
most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map
Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise,
ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not
appear here. Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or
the city clerk for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's
ordinances.
ORDINANCE ADOPTION PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY THE CITY CHARTER
   . . . The enacting clause of all ordinances shall be, "The council of the
City of Cookeville hereby ordains:" (Charter § 2.14)
   Each motion, resolution, and ordinance shall be in written form before being
introduced. The affirmative vote of at least three (3) members of the council
shall be required to pass any motion, resolution, or ordinance. Each ordinance,
before being adopted, shall be considered and passed at two meetings one week
apart, except that an emergency ordinance may be passed at two meetings only
one (1) day apart, and shall take effect ten (10) days after its adoption,
except that an ordinance containing a full statement of the facts and reasons
for an emergency may be made effective upon its adoption if approved by at
least four (4) members of the council on both readings. No ordinance relating
to a franchise, exclusive contract, or other special privilege shall be passed
as an emergency ordinance. Amendments of ordinances and resolutions or parts
thereof shall be accomplished only by setting forth the complete section,
sections, subsection, or subsections in their amended form. A code may be
adopted by an ordinance which contains a reference to its title, date, and
issuing organization, but the city shall furnish a copy of any such code to any
person for a reasonable fee. . . .
   An abstract of the essential provisions of each ordinance shall be published
once in the official city newspaper within ten (10) days after its adoption,
except that only the title shall be so published of a code adopted by reference
as provided in this section. (Charter § 2.15)
CHARTER OF THE CITY OF COOKEVILLE, TENNESSEE 1
1   Priv. Acts 1961, ch. 223, is the current basic charter act for the City of

Assembly. Sections of the charter which have been amended contain at the end of
those sections the citation to the official private act or acts constituting
the amendment or amendments. No other changes have been made to the charter
except the addition of a table of contents to facilitate its use. A list of all
the private acts including the basic charter appears at the end of the charter.
Acts which did not expressly or in effect amend any particular section or part
of the basic charter, but which supplemented it, have been placed after the

allotments shall not exceed the total appropriation for each department and
agency, and no expenditure encumbrance shall be made in excess of the
allotments approved by the city manager. An allotment may be revised by the
city manager at any time in the fiscal year. If at any time it shall appear to
the city manager that revenue is to be less than the original estimate of
revenue on which appropriations were based, he shall review all allotments and
may appropriate revisions downward in order to prevent the making of
expenditures and encumbrances in excess of probable revenue; provided, that no
salaries shall be reduced except by ordinance. If there is a separate city

other obligations may be issued under any such general law without regard to
the requirements, restrictions or other procedural provisions contained in this
Act or in this title. [As added by Priv. Acts 1963, ch. 74, § 10]
ARTICLE VIA.

which act is entitled: "An Act to empower the City of Cookeville to acquire,
construct, install, or substantially reconstruct public parking facilities; to
issue bonds therefor; to secure such bonds in whole or in part by special
assessments; and to empower the City to maintain, operate, and police such
facilities." Since the act did not specify where or how it should be added to
the city's charter, it has arbitrarily been added by the compiler at this
point.
SECTION 6A.01. Definitions.
   That for the purpose of this Act (Article), unless a different meaning
clearly appears in the context, the following definitions of terms shall be
used in its interpretation:
      (a)   Governing body. The "Council-Manager Government" of the City of
Cookeville.
      (b)   Municipality. The City of Cookeville.

substantial reconstruction of public parking facilities to include lots and/or
buildings for the parking of motor vehicles.
      (d)   Costs. Cost of labor, materials, equipment necessary to complete an
improvement, land, easements, and other necessary expenses connected with an
improvement including preliminary and other surveys, inspections of the work,
engineers' fees and costs, attorneys' fees, fiscal agents' fees, preparation of
plans and specifications, publication expenses, interest which may become due
on bonds before collection of the first improvement assessments, a reasonable
allowance for unforseen contingencies, and other costs of financing.
      (e)   Assessed value basis. The plan for making annual improvement
assessments according to the assessed values of benefited properties, as
assessed for purposes of municipal property taxation, or as provided by this
Act (Article). Such assessed values shall be the measure of benefits to
benefited property or property to be benefited.
      (f)   Improvement assessment. An assessment made each year against
benefited property to pay the costs of an improvement, in the proportion that
the assessed value of each parcel or lot of benefited property bears to the
total assessed value of all benefited property according to the latest

provided by this Act (Article).
      (g)   Benefitted property, property to be benefitted. As determined by
the governing body, real property which is within a reasonable distance from an

proximity to the improvement. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 1]
SECTION 6A.02. Provisions in this article are supplementary.
   That the City of Cookeville is authorized to provide for, construct, and
finance improvements defined in Section 1 (
6A.01) according to the plan set forth in this Act (Article). The authority
hereby conferred is not intended to be in derogation of any authority otherwise
conferred upon the municipality, but is alternative and in addition thereto. If
the municipality has taken any step or steps under any other law to provide
for, construct or finance such improvements, it may by resolution abandon the
procedure under the other law and proceed under the provisions of this Act
(Article). The issuance of bonds under this Act (Article) shall not be subject
to any limitations on municipal indebtedness imposed by the municipality's
charter or any public or private act. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, §
2]
SECTION 6A.03. Resolution for the project, notice of public hearing, etc.
   When the governing body of the municipality shall determine to construct an
improvement as authorized by this Act (Article) or when it is petitioned by the
owners of property to be benefited having an assessed value of at least 51 per
cent of the total assessed value of all the property to be benefited from the
proposed improvement, it shall adopt a resolution that such improvement shall
be made. Said resolution shall describe the geographical limits of the proper
ties to be benefited, and the location, nature, scope and extent of the
improvement. The resolution shall also include a preliminary estimate of the
costs prepared by an engineer licensed by the State of Tennessee, a declaration
that the improvement will be designed and construction will be supervised by an
engineer licensed by the State of Tennesse, and a statement of the proportion

exceed 75 per cent of the total costs of the improvement; provided, however,
that the total costs may be assessed against benefited properties if the
governing body additionally pledges full faith and credit of the municipality
to satisfy any deficiency in collections of improvement assessments. In all
succeeding proceedings, the municipality shall be bound and limited by the
resolution as it may be amended, except that the total costs assessed against
benefited properties may exceed the preliminary estimate of costs by not more

governing body at a time and place specified therein. The municipality shall
publish the resolution and a notice of the hearing at least seven (7) days in
advance of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality and by posting at the main office of the municipal government.
Said notice shall state that any owner of property to be benefited may appear
to be heard as to (a) whether the proposed improvement should be undertaken as
planned, or abandoned, (b) whether the nature and scope of the improvement
should be altered and (c) whether the improvement should be financed through
the issuance of bonds on the "assessed value basis" as authorized by this Act
(Article). Said notice should also be sent by first class mail to the owners of

6A.03), or at the time and place to which same may be adjourned from time to
time, all persons whose property may be affected by such improvement may appear
in person or by attorney or by petition. After said public hearing and after
considering any objections, the governing body by resolution may confirm, amend
or rescind the original resolution as its final action. Such final action shall
be the final determination of the issues presented unless the owners of
property to be benefited file, within ten (10) days thereafter, a petition for
a referendum on the original resolution signed by ten per cent (10%) of the
said property owners. Upon the filing of the petition in the office of the City
Clerk, it shall be the duty of the governing body to call an election on the
special question of approval or non-approval of the original resolution. Said
election shall be called by resolution of the governing body at its next
regular meeting and shall be held in the same manner and by the same officials
as a general municipal election except that the municipal building shall be the
sole voting place, and notice thereof shall be given by publication not less
than two (2) times in a newspaper of general circulation, the first of which
publication shall be made not less than twenty (20) days prior to the date of
such election. No other notice shall be necessary. The qualifications of voters
voting on the question shall be that of ownership of property which may be
affected by such improvements. All laws applicable to general elections shall
apply to the determination of the approval or non-approval of the resolution.
The approval or non-approval of the resolution by the voters shall be the final
determination of the issues. It shall be the duty of the governing body of such
municipality to enter upon its minutes the results and returns of such
election.
   Failure to file a petition for a referendum within ten (10) days shall
constitute a waiver of all objections. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, §
4]

governing body of a bid, or combination of bids, the governing body may
determine the principal amount of bonds to be issued for the proposed
improvement, taking into account the amount of the accepted bid or bids, and
all other costs of the improvement. Each contract shall be supported by a
performance bond for the full amount thereof, with good surety to be approved
by the governing body. A bid shall not be binding on a contractor unless the
governing body awards a contract within 90 days after the date of opening bids.
(b) If the governing body determines that no bids are acceptable, it may direct
that the improvement be accomplished by the municipality's own forces, in which
event the costs of construction included in the total costs for purposes of
determining improvement assessments shall not exceed the lowest construction
bid or bids which conform to all bid requirements. [As added by Priv. Acts
1970, ch. 276, § 5]

for purposes of municipal property taxation or as provided by this Act
(Article), the total of such annual improvement assessments to be sufficient to

year an additional sum equal to 20 per cent of average annual principal and
interest requirements which shall constitute a "debt service reserve" as a
precaution against possible default by reason of failures in the collection of
the annual improvement assessments;
      (e)   Covenant with the holders of said bonds and interest coupons that
until the payment in full thereof the municipality will make and collect annual
improvement assessments upon the benefited properties, as provided in this Act
(Article);

interest on the bonds if collections of improvement assessments are inadequate
to meet such obligations, if the governing body decides that such additional
security is desirable. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 6]
SECTION 6A.07. Bids for bonds.
   That the municipality shall solicit the submission of bids or proposals for
purchase of the bonds authorized by the Bond Resolution, the same to be
received upon a sealed competitive basis after advertisement by publication one
time in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, not less than
10 days before the date set for the opening and consideration of such bids.
Bids shall be evaluated as to net effective interest rates on the sums of money
actually to be received by the municipality, and no bids at more than 6 per
cent interest may be accepted. If no bids are received upon terms acceptable to
the governing body and conforming to the published notice, bids may again be
solicited in the same manner until a purchase bid is received upon terms
acceptable to the governing body. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 7]
SECTION 6A.08. Disposition of bond funds.
   That (a) whe the bonds are sold, the proceeds shall be deposited in a bank
or trust company, or combined bank and trust company, except as hereinafter
provided, pursuant to an escrow agreement approved by the attorney who approved
the bonds; to the extent such deposit is not insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation it shall be secured in such manner as may be approved by
the governing body. The bond proceeds may also be invested by the governing
body in securities of the United States Government, and interest received from
such investments shall be deposited in the aforesaid account.
      (b)   There shall be set aside into a "Parking Improvement (No.) Special
Fund," hereinafter created, a sum from bond proceeds equal to all interest
which will accrue on said bonds until the date when the first improvement
assessments in connection therewith will become due and payable. The remainder
may be disbursed from time to time in payment of costs of the improvement,
except that payments on account of the construction contracts shall not exceed
90 per cent of the amount certified in writing by the engineer as having been
earned for materials furnished and/or labor performed by a contractor, the
retained 10 per cent to be disbursed only upon final acceptance of the finished
work of such contractor. If, after completion, acceptance and payment of the
work of all contractors, and the payment of all costs of the improvement, as
herein defined, there shall remain an unexpended balance in the aforesaid bank
account, such balance shall be transferred to the "Parking Improvement (No.)
Special Fund" created and maintained in connection with the improvement. [As
added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 8]
SECTION 6A.09. Bonds, bond security, etc.
   That each of said bonds shall bear on its face the statement that it has
been issued under this Act, 1 that it does not pledge the full faith and credit
of the municipality as a general obligation indebtedness of the municipality,
and that it is secured solely by the pledge of the municipality to make and
collect annual improvement assessments as provided in this Act; provided,
however, that the governing body may modify said statement to additionally
pledge the full faith and credit of the municipality to satisfy any deficiency
in collections of special assessments. The bonds, and the receipt of interest
thereon, shall not be subject to taxation. The bonds shall have all the
qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments. If the municipality's full
faith and credit is not contingently pledged, the bonds, and the interest
thereon, shall be payable exclusively from the annual improvement assessments
collected from time to time upon the properties benefited by the improvement
identified in the bonds. If the municipality pays any principal or interest on
the bonds from its general funds, it shall be subrogated to the rights of the
bondholders for the proceeds from the improvement assessments to the extent of
such payments and shall reimburse the general fund for such payments from
improvement assessments collected after obligations on the bonds have been met.
[As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 9]
1   Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276.
SECTION 6A.10. Basis of assessments.
   That improvement assessments shall be assessed annually against the
benefited property in the proportion that the assessed value of each lot or
parcel bears to the whole assessed value of the benefited properties.
Properties not assessed for taxation, such as public property or property
exempt from taxation, shall be specially assessed by the municipal assessor, by
the county assessor if the municipality uses county property assessments, or by
a special assessor appointed by the governing body for this purpose, for which
compensation may be paid from the "Parking Improvement (No.) Special Fund" or
from the general fund of the municipality. Any such special assessment shall be
subject to the procedure for equalization and judicial review provided by the
law for assessments made for purposes of property taxation. [As added by Priv.
Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 10]
SECTION 6A.11. Assessments against public property.
   That benefited property owned by the municipality, a county, the State of
Tennessee, or the United States Government or its agencies (if Federal law
makes such property subject to assessment) shall be subject to improvement
assessments, the same as private property, and the amount of each annual
improvement assessment shall be paid by the municipality, county, State of
Tennessee, or United States Government, as the case may be. In the case of the
State of Tennessee, the amount of improvement assessment shall be certified by
the municipality to the Commissioner of Finance who shall direct the State
Treasurer to pay the same to the municipality out of an appropriate
appropriation or from any money in the State Treasury not otherwise
appropriated. No benefited property shall be exempt from improvement
assessments. Improvement assessments against such public property shall be
enforceable by writ of mandamus or other appropriate remedy. [As added by Priv.
Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 11]
SECTION 6A.12. Payment of assessments; penalties and interest for delinquency.
   That annual improvement assessments for each improvement shall be made by
the governing body when the levy of municipal property taxes is made; and such
improvement assessments shall be due at the same time, or times, the municipal
property taxes are due, and shall be subject to the same penalties and accrual
of interest in the event of non-payment as in the case of municipal property
taxes. The governing body may permit owners of benefited property to pay
improvement assessments in equal monthly installments, the first installment to
be due and payable when the improvement assessment is due; in this event any
monthly payment shall be delinquent 30 days after it is due and payable, and
the whole balance of the annual improvement assessment shall thereupon become
delinquent and be subject to all penalties and interest as provided in this Act
(Article.) [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 12]
SECTION 6A.13. Assessments to constitute liens.
   That each improvement assessment, with any penalty or interest incident to
the nonpayment thereof, shall constitute a lien upon the lot or parcel of
benefited property against which it is assessed. The lien shall attach to each
lot or parcel of benefited property at the time the annual improvement
assessment is made, and thereupon shall take precedence over all othe liens,
whether created prior to or subsequent to the making of such improvement
assessment, except State, county and municipal property taxes, and prior
special assessments. Said lien shall not be defeated or postponed by any
private or judicial sale, by any mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the
description of the property or in the names of the owners, if the description
is sufficient to identify the property subject to the assessment. No
irregularity in the proceedings of the governing body shall exempt any
benefited property from the lien for the improvement assessment, or from the
payment thereof or from the penalties or interest thereon. [As added by Priv.
Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 13]
SECTION 6A.14. Special fund for assessments.
   That the proceeds received by the municipality from improvement assessments
made in connection with each separate improvement shall be segregated from and
kept always separate and apart from all other funds of the city, and shall be
deposited in a financial institution in a special account designated as the
"Parking Improvement (No.) Special Fund." [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch.
276, § 14]
SECTION 6A.15. Disposition of collected assessments; calculation of annual
assessments, etc.
   That (a) all sums received and deposited in each such special fund shall be
held inviolate and applied by the municipality solely for the payment of the
principal of, and interest on, the bonds issued for the financing of the
identified improvement, except as otherwise provided herein. The amounts
collected and deposited in each such special fund from the first improvement
assessments in connection with any improvement, in excess of maturing principal
and interest on the bonds, for the purpose of creating a "debt service reserve"
as provide in Section 6 (
6A.06), hereof, shall be held in the special fund for that purpose. If
collections of the first annual improvement assessments shall fail to produce a
sum sufficient to provide the minimum "debt service reserve" required by
Section 6 (
6A.06) hereof, the next annual improvement assessments shall be fixed at such
levels as may be necessary to constitue said minimum "debt service reserve"
after providing for the current year's principal and interest maturities. If,
at the time of making subsequent improvement assessments, the sum held in a
special fund as the "debt service reserve" shall exceed the level herein
specified, such excess may be taken into account in calculating the improvement
assessments for the current year; and if the amount so held in said "debt
service reserve" is below said specified level, the next annual improvement
assessments shall be increased to constitute the "debt service reserve" at said
minimum level. In making improvement assessments for the year preceding the
final maturing of bonds for an improvement, the governing body may take into
account, and make allowance for, the amount held in the special fund of the
particular improvement as a "debt service reserve." If the governing body shall
miscalculate and provide funds insufficient to pay the final maturing principal
and interest, it shall make subsequent improvement assessments upon the
benefited properties sufficient to make up the deficiency, including interest
to date of payment. If the procedures required by this Act shall result in a
surplus after payment of the bonds and all interest thereon, such surplus shall
be refunded, pro rata, to the owners of benefited properties of record at the
date such surplus is ascertained by the governing body to exist.
      (b)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Act (Article), no
improvement assessment may be increased more than 5 per cent on account of
insufficient collection of improvement assessments. The municipality shall
provide from its general funds, by issuance of bonds as provided by general law
for public works if necessary, such additional funds as may be required on
account of insufficient collection of improvement assessments to pay principal
and interest on the improvement assessment bonds when due. Whatever amount of
delinquent improvement assessments are eventually collected by enforcement of
liens or by other means shall be applied to the source of such additional
funds, the general funds of the municipality, or to retire any bonds that were
issued. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 15]
SECTION 6A.16. Additional bonds or funds to cover deficiency.
   That (a) if, by reason of miscalculation or the happening of unforeseen
events or conditions, the proceeds of the bonds authorized by the Bond
Resolution should prove to be insufficient to pay in full the improvement costs
assessed against benefited properties, the governing body shall be authorized
to issue and sell additional bonds sufficient to make up the deficiency, and
such additional bonds shall rank on a parity with the bonds originally
authorized and shall be retired by improvement assessments in the same manner
as the original bonds.
      (b)   The municipality may use any funds legally available to it,
including proceeds from bonds issued under any other legislative authority, to
pay for that portion of the cost of an improvement not financed by bonds
secured by improvement assessments. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, §
16]
SECTION 6A.17. Refunding bonds.
   That the governing body may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of
providing for the payment of any outstanding bonds. The refunding bonds shall
be secured by improvement assessments in the same manner as provided herein for
the bonds which are refunded. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 17]
SECTION 6A.18. Use of parking facilities; disposition of revenues.
   That the use by the public of all public parking facilities acquired,
constructed, installed or substantially reconstructed under the provisions of
this act shall be free or for such charge or charges as shall be determined by
the governing body to be collected either by parking meters or by attendants or
othewise. The cost of maintaining, operating, and policing such facilities
shall be borne by the city of from revenues resulting from any charges made by
the governing body. Any surplus revenues over and above a reasonable reserve
resulting from charges for the use of such facilities will be applied to reduce
special assessments so long as any bonds issued hereinunder are outstanding.
Thereafter any such surplus may be used as the governing body shall direct. [As
added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 18]
SECTION 6A.19. Severability clause.
   That the provisions of this Act (Article) are hereby declared to be
severable. If any of its sections, provisions, exceptions, sentences, clauses,
phrases or parts be held unconstitutional or void the remainder of this Act
(Article) shall continue in full force and effect, it being the legislative
intent now hereby declared that this Act (Article) would have been adopted even
if such unconstitutional or void matter had not been included therein. [As
added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 19]
SECTION 6A.20. Approval required.
   That this act (article) shall become operative in accordance with its
provisions upon approval by a two-thirds vote of the governing body of the City
of Cookeville. The presiding officer of said body shall certify the results
thereof to the Secretary of State. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 20]
SECTION 6A.21. Date of effect.
   That this Act (Article) shall become effective from and after its passage,
the public welfare requiring it. [As added by Priv. Acts 1970, ch. 276, § 21]

registered voters at the last preceding regular municipal election may be filed
with the city clerk requesting that any such ordinance be either repealed or
submitted to a vote of the electors.
SECTION 11.03. Form of Petitions: Committee of Petitioners.
   Be it further enacted, That all petition papers circulated for the purposes
of an initiative or referendum shall be uniform in size and style. Initiative
petition papers shall contain the full text of the proposed ordinance. The
signatures to initiative or referendum petitions need not all be appended to
one paper, but to each separate petition there shall be attached a statement of
the circulator thereof as provided by this section. Each signer of any such
petition paper shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall
indicate after his name his place of residence by street and number, or other
description sufficient to identify the place. There shall appear on each
petition the names and addresses of the same five electors, who, as a committee
of the petitioners, shall be regarded as responsible for the circulation and
filing of the petition. Attached to each separate petition paper there shall be
an affidavit of the circulator thereof that he, and he only, personally
circulated the foregoing paper, that it bears a stated number of signatures,
that all the signatures appended thereto were made in his presence, and that he
believes them to be the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they
purport to be.
SECTION 11.04. Filing, Examination and Certification of Petitions.
   Be it further enacted, That all petition papers comprising an initiative or
referendum petition shall be assembled and filed with the city clerk as one
instrument. Within twenty days after a petition is filed, the city clerk shall
determine whether each paper of the petition has a proper statement of the
circulator and whether the petition is signed by a sufficient number of
qualified electors. The city clerk shall declare any petition paper entirely
invalid which does not have attached thereto an affidavit signed by the
circulator thereof. If a petition paper is found to be signed by more persons
than the number of signatures certified by the circulator, the last signatures
in excess of the number certified shall be disregarded. If a petition paper is
found to be signed by fewer persons than the number certified, the signatures
shall be accepted unless void on other grounds. After completing his
examination of the petition, the city clerk shall certify the result thereof to
the council at its next regular meeting.
   If he shall certify that the petition is insufficient he shall set forth in
his certificate the particulars in which it is defective and shall at once
notify the committee of the petitioners of his findings.
SECTION 11.05. Amendment of Petitions.
   Be it further enacted, That an initiative or referendum petition may be
amended at any time within ten days after the notification of insufficiency has
been sent by the city clerk, by filing a supplementary petition upon additional
papers signed and filed as provided in case of an original petition. The city
clerk shall, within five days after such an amendment is filed, make
examination of the amended petition and, if the petition be still insufficient,
he shall file his certificate to that effect in his office and notify the
committee of the petitioners of his findings and no further action shall be had
on such insufficient petition. The findings of the insufficiency of a petition
shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
SECTION 11.06. Effect of Certification of Referendum Petition.
   Be it further enacted, That when a referendum petition, or amended petition,
has been certified as sufficient by the city clerk, the ordinance specified in
the petition shall not go into effect, or further action thereunder shall be
suspended if it shall have gone into effect, until and unless approved by the
electors, as hereinafter provided.
SECTION 11.07. Consideration by Council.
   Be it further enacted, That whenever council receives a certified initiative
or referendum petition from the city clerk, it shall proceed at once to
consider such petition. A proposed initiative ordinance shall be read and
provision shall be made for a public hearing upon the proposed ordinance. The
council shall take final action on the ordinance not later than sixty days
after the date on which such ordinance was submitted to the council by the city
clerk. A referred ordinance shall be reconsidered by the council and its final
vote upon such reconsideration shall be upon the question, "Shall the ordinance
specified in the referendum petition be repealed?"
SECTION 11.08. Submission to Electors.
   Be it further enacted, That if the council shall fail to pass an ordinance
proposed by initiative petition, or shall pass it in a form different from that
set forth in the petition therefor, or if the council fail to repeal a referred
ordinance, the proposed or referred ordinance shall be submitted to the
electors not less than thirty days nor more than one year from the date the
council takes its final vote thereon. The council may, in its discretion, and
if no regular election is to be held within such period shall, provide for a
special election.
SECTION 11.09. Form of Ballot for Initiated and Referred Ordinances.
   Be it further enacted, That ordinances submitted to vote of the electors in
accordance with the initiative and referendum provisions of this charter shall
be submitted by ballot title, which shall be prepared in all cases by the legal
adviser of the city. The ballot title may be different from the legal title of
any such initiated or referred ordinance and shall be a clear, concise
statement, without argument or prejudice, descriptive of the substance of such
ordinance.
   The ballot used in voting upon any ordinance, if a paper ballot, shall leave
below the ballot title the following propositions, one above the other, in the
order indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE" and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE."
   Immediately at the left of each proposition there shall be a square in which
by making a cross (X) the elector may vote for or against the ordinance. Any
number of ordinances may be voted on at the same election and may be submitted
on the same ballot, but any paper ballot used for voting thereon shall be for
that purpose only. If voting machines are used, the ballot title of any
ordinance shall have below it the same two propositions, one above the other or
one preceding the other in the order indicated, and the elector shall be given
an opportunity to vote for either of the two propositions and thereby to vote
for or against the ordinance.
SECTION 11.10. Results of Election.
   Be it further enacted, That if a majority of the electors voting on a
proposed initiative ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon
be an ordinance of the city. A referred ordinance which is not approved by a
majority of the electors voting thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If
conflicting ordinances are approved by the electors at the same election, the
one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the
extent of such conflict.
SECTION 11.11. Repealing Ordinances: Publication.
   Be it further enacted, That initiative and referendum ordinances adopted or
approved by the electors shall be published, and may be amended or repealed by
the council, as in the case of other ordinances.

   HOUSE BILL NO. 1984
   By Representative Hargrove
   Substituted for: Senate Bill No. 1987
   By Senator Burks
   An Act to establish the Cookeville Regional Medical Center Authority and to
amend Chapter 223 of the Private Acts of 1961; as subsequently amended by
various private acts, including Chapter 61 of the Private Acts of 1995; Chapter
209 of the Private Acts of 1996 and Chapter 14 of the Private Acts of 1997; and
any other acts amendatory thereto, relative to the Cookeville Regional Medical
Center.
   WHEREAS, Cookeville Regional Medical Center was established as part of the
Charter of the City of Cookeville pursuant to Chapter 223 of the Private Acts
of 1961 of the Private Acts of 1995, Chapter 209 of the Private Acts of 1996,
and Chapter 14 of the Private Acts of 1997; and
   WHEREAS, Chapter 223 of the Private Acts of 1961, as subsequently amended,
established a Board of Trustees for Cookeville Regional Medical Center, the
powers and duties for such Board of Trustees, terms of offices and elections of
successors for such Board of Trustees, and other powers relative to the
operation of Cookeville Regional Hospital and related facilities; and
   WHEREAS, significant changes in the delivery of health care have occurred
since the establishment of Cookeville Regional Medical Center and its Board of
Trustees; and
   WHEREAS, the organization of the Board of Trustees of Cookeville Regional
Medical Center as part of the Cookeville City Charter creates constraints on
the authority and operations of such Board of Trustees so as to preclude it
from responding to the changes in the delivery of health care; and
   WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds that the operations of Cookeville
Regional Medical Center and related facilities will be enhanced if its Board of
Trustees is reconstituted as a private act hospital authority as that term is
used in 1996 Tenn. Pub. Acts, Ch. 778, the Private Act Hospital Authority Act
of 1996; and
   WHEREAS, the purpose of this act is to reconstitute the Board of Trustees of
Cookeville Regional Medical Center as the Board of Trustees of the Cookeville

now, therefore,

revoked for the violation of the provisions of this chapter or the provisions
of the state beer laws of the State of Tennessee. Complaints filed against any
permit holder for the purpose of suspending or revoking such permit shall be
made in writing and filed with the ABCB. When the ABCB shall have reason to
believe that any permit holder shall have violated any of the provisions of
this chapter or any of the provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, title
57, chapter 4, and as subsequently amended, the ABCB is authorized, in its
discretion, to notify the permittee of said violations and to cite said

cause shall state the alleged violations charged and shall be served upon
permittee either by registered mail or by a member of the Police Department of

ten (10) days before the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the ABCB shall
publicly hear the evidence both in support of the charges and on behalf of the

as provided in the Tennessee Code Annotated, § title 57, chapter 4, and as
subsequently amended. When a permit is revoked, no new permit shall be issued
hereunder for the sale of beer at the same location, until the expiration of

time. The ABCB shall serve notice of the suspension on the Tennessee Alcoholic
Beverage Commission, which shall review that suspension within thirty (30) days
of receipt of such notice, and render a decision affirming or reversing such
suspension. Failure of the alcoholic beverage commission to act within thirty
(30) days shall be construed as an affirmation of such suspension. The
alcoholic beverage control board, may, at the time it imposes a revocation or
suspension, offer a permit holder the alternative of paying a civil penalty not
to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for each offense of
making or permitting to be made any sales to minors, or a civil penalty not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other offense. If the civil
penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or suspension, the holder
shall have seven (7) days within which to pay the civil penalty before the
revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within
that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed withdrawn

regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.

effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the city council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions

occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not

California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979,

Louisville, Kentucky - 2004; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the
Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually
Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the city council
finds:
      (a)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and
legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to
such secondary effects.

conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of geological conditions
of the proposed development, and opinions and recommendations covering the
adequacy of sites to be developed by the proposed grading.
   (8)   Federal and State Permits. Approval by the City of Cookeville does not
relieve the applicant of responsibility for obtaining any permits required by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation - Division of Water Resources, Region IV of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, or by any other federal or state agencies. Following is a
non-inclusive list of permits that may be required:
      (a)   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Section 301 of the Clean Water Act
prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United
States unless the work has been previously authorized by a permit pursuant to
Section 404 of the same Act. Placement of dredged or fill material below
ordinary high water of any water in conjunction with drainage improvements
(e.g., channel realignments, concrete slope paving) will require a Department
of the Army permit prior to construction.
   The placement of dredged or fill material or any grading activities within a
wetland must also be in compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
   If a permit is required, approximately sixty (60) days would normally be
required for permit processing. Depending on the nature and location of the
work, it is possible that the work has been previously approved under authority
of the nationwide permit and individual processing would not be required.
      (b)   Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation - Division of
Water Resources. In accordance with the Tennessee Water Quality Act, Tennessee
Code Annotated, §69-3-108, any activity which alters a course or physical
character of a stream, requires an Aquatic Resource Alteration Permit (ARAP).
This permit is required for activities such as stream channelization, stream
enlargement, dredging, or diversion in box culverts.
   (9)   Adoption of Standards.
      (a)   The design, installation, operation, maintenance, inspection,
record keeping and reporting of construction site runoff best management
practices intended for erosion prevention and the control of sediment and other
construction related wastes or pollutants shall be performed in accordance with
the requirements of the Tennessee Construction General Permit that is effective
at the time the stormwater pollution prevention plan is approved. Where the
provisions of this section conflict or overlap with the Tennessee Construction
General Permit or the Tennessee Erosion & Sediment Control Handbook, the
regulation which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards or
requirements shall prevail.
      (b)   The City adopts as its erosion and sediment control design
standards and best management practices manual the Tennessee Erosion & Sediment
Control Handbook which is incorporated herein by reference. This handbook
includes a list of acceptable BMPs, including the specific design performance
criteria, operation and maintenance requirements for each BMP.
      (c)   The requirements set forth in the Tennessee Construction General
Permit and in the handbook may be updated and expanded at the discretion of the
Public Works Director, based on improvements in engineering, science,
monitoring and local maintenance experience.
      (d)   Erosion and sediment control BMPs that are designed, constructed
and maintained in accordance with the BMP criteria set forth in the Tennessee
Construction General Permit and the handbook shall be presumed to meet the
minimum water quality performance standards required by the city.
      (e)   Additional requirements for discharges into impaired or exceptional
Tennessee waters that are set forth in the Tennessee Construction General
Permit shall be implemented for all priority construction activities. The
Public Works Director, at his discretion, may require BMPs that conform to a
higher than minimum standard for priority construction activities, or for
exceptional Tennessee waters or where deemed necessary.
   (10)   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
      (a)   The SWPPP is required for obtaining QLP Permit coverage for sites
with a disturbed area greater than one acre. A SWPPP shall present in detail
the best management practices that will be employed to minimize erosion and
control sedimentation.
      (b)   The plan shall be sealed in accordance with the Tennessee

   (4)   Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Requirements.
      (a)   An erosion and sediment control plan and a narrative Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is required whenever QLP Permit coverage is
required. In addition, a separate erosion and sediment control plan may be
required for a Grading Permit if the Public Works Department determines that
the development is so complex that soil erosion and sediment controls cannot be
included in the grading plan in a clear and understandable manner or if it is
determined that the site is in a special hazard area.
      (b)   The erosion and sediment control plan shall be prepared by a
professional engineer registered in the state of Tennessee. This plan will be
clearly identified as an "erosion and sediment control plan". A Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan must be developed by persons meeting the requirements
for SWPPP preparation as required by the Tennessee Construction General Permit
that is effective at the time the storm water pollution prevention plan is
approved.
      (c)   Erosion and sediment control plans will conform to the requirements
of the Tennessee Construction General Permit.
   (5)   Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control Plans. The Tennessee
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (latest edition) has been adopted by the
City of Cookeville as an approved best management practices manual. Other
specifications may be used upon review and approval of the Public Works
Director.
   (6)   Requirements for Erosion and Sediment Control.
      (a)   The design, installation, operation, maintenance, inspection,
record keeping and reporting of construction site runoff best management
practices intended for erosion prevention and sediment control and other
construction related wastes or pollutants shall be performed in accordance with
the requirements of the Tennessee Construction General Permit that is effective
at the time the Grading Permit or the QLP Permit coverage is obtained.
      (b)   The requirements set forth in the Tennessee Construction General
Permit and the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook may be updated
and expanded at the discretion of the Director of Public Works, based on
improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance
experience.
      (c)   Neighboring persons and property shall be protected from damage or
loss resulting from excessive storm water runoff, soil erosion or deposition
upon private property or public right-of-way of water transported silt and
debris. Adjacent property owners shall be protected from land devaluation due
to exposed bare banks.
   (7)   Permitting Procedures. The following procedures for applying for
either a Grading Permit or QLP Permit coverage shall apply:
      (a)   Pre-application conference. A pre-application conference with the
Public Works Department is required to assure timely permit application
preparation and review. This conference will be used to determine if a proposed
project qualifies for exemption and to determine how technical guidelines and
criteria should be applied. At this time a decision will be made as to which
permit is required for the project.
      (b)   Submittal. Submission of the permit application, plans (one (1)
set) and any other required submittals, i.e. drainage calculations, water
quality is to be made to the Public Works Department. Plans and submittals for
a Building Permit must be submitted to the Codes Department for the review by
the plans examiner.
      (c)   Review. The Public Works Department will review the permit
application to ensure that all information is provided in accordance with the
regulations. Should the application be found to be incomplete, it will be
returned to the applicant with a written request for additional information.
The application will not be processed until such time as any requested
information or reports are submitted.
      (d)   Permit issuance. If the work described in the permit application,
including drawings and/or SWPPP, conforms to the requirements of these
regulations and any other pertinent laws and ordinances, and when the fees and
warranty of improvements have been paid, a Grading Permit or QLP Permit
coverage will be issued. Alternately if the permit application does not meet
the requirements the application will be denied and a written explanation will
be provided to the applicant. The issuance of either permit will not be
construed to mean approval for violation of any of the provisions of these
regulations or any other law or regulation; and such permit will not be valid,
except insofar as the work or use that it authorizes is lawful. The issuance of
a Grading Permit shall not prevent the Director of Public Works from requiring
the correction of errors or changes due to unforeseen problems in permitted
plans and specifications. The Director of Public Works may require operations
and project design be modified if significant problems occur which were not
considered at the time the permit was issued. The issuance of a Grading Permit
or QLP Permit coverage in no way implies that a building permit will be issued.
      (e)   Revisions to approved plans. Prior to or during construction,
should changes be anticipated that would constitute a revision of the plans
already approved by the Public Works Director, the approved plans are to be
revised and resubmitted in triplicate with a letter stating why such changes
are believed necessary. Approval or disapproval by the Public Works Director
will be given in written form.
      (f)   Expiration. Every permit issued by the Public Works Director under
provisions of these regulations shall expire by limitation and become null and
void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within ninety (90)
days from the date of issuance of the permit, provided that consecutive renewal
of such permit may be granted, at no additional cost, upon written request to
the Public Works Director with good cause shown. The work authorized by such
permit shall not be suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is
commences and shall be carried to completion or the permit shall be void. If
work is suspended or abandoned, the required warranty of improvements may be
issued to correct or eliminate erosion, drainage problems, or hazardous
conditions.
      (g)   Suspension or revocation. The Public Works Director shall suspend
or revoke a permit issued under provisions of these regulations by giving
notice in writing to the owner whenever the permit is issued in error, on the
basis of incorrect information supplied or in violation of any ordinance,
regulation or any of the provisions of these regulations.
   (8)   Construction Procedures.
      (a)   Permit required prior to commencing any work. A person, firm, or
corporation required to obtain a Grading Permit or QLP Permit coverage in
compliance with these regulations must do so prior to commencing any work
pertaining to the permit. Corrective measures, including but not limited to
stop work orders, penalties, and injunctions, may be taken as required to
enforce the terms of this requirement.
      (b)   Posting of permit. Work requiring a Grading Permit or QLP Permit
coverage shall not be commenced until the permit holder or his agent has posted
the permit and SWPPP if one is required, in a conspicuous place on the front of
the premises. The permit/SWPPP shall be protected from the weather and be
placed to allow easy access for recording entries. The permit shall remain
posted until the certificate of occupancy has been issued and/or a notice of
termination has been turned into the Public Works Director on QLP Permit
coverage.
      (c)   Notification of construction. After posting the permit, the
permittee must first install all erosion and sediment control measures as shown
on the plans. All clearing and/or earthwork are subject to inspection by the
city, and should it be determined that additional erosion control measures are
needed they shall be promptly acquired and installed by the permittee.
      (d)   Observation of construction. The owner shall be responsible for the
ongoing observation, review and field issuance of reports in the actual
earthwork. This responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to,
testing, inspection and issuing field reports as to the establishment of line,
grade and drainage of the project area. Civil engineering record documents
shall be preserved in accordance with state law. Permittees with QLP Permit
coverage are responsible for documented inspections on approved inspection
forms and shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of the
Tennessee Construction General Permit that is effective at the time the storm
water pollution prevention plan is approved.
      (e)   Notification of non-compliance. If the owner, his contractor or his
consultants finds that the work is not being done in conformance with these
regulations or the permitted plans, the discrepancies, if not corrected in a
timely manner, must be reported immediately in writing to the Director of
Public Works. Plans for corrective measures must be submitted to the Director
of Public Works along with an appropriate schedule for completion of such
corrections.
      (f)   Replacement of contractors or consultants. If the owner's
contractor, civil engineer, engineering geologist or the testing agency of
record, are changed during the course of the work, the owner shall replace the
contractor or consultants of record with a qualified individual, and will
notify the Director of Public Works in writing. Those with QLP Permit coverage
are required to have the contractor listed on their QLP NOI and any change in
the contractor must be noted and the new contractor must sign the QLP Permit.
      (g)   Notification of completion. Holders of a Grading Permit must notify
the Director of Public Works when the project has been completed, including
installation of any permanent storm water management facilities in accordance
with the final permitted plans. Those with QLP Permit coverage must complete a
Notice of Termination (NOT) form provided in accordance with the requirements
of the Tennessee Construction General Permit that is effective at the time the
storm water pollution prevention plan is approved. Once a NOT has been received
by the Public Works Department, the department will review the NOT and inspect
the site to determine if coverage under the QLP permit can be terminated or if
there are deficiencies that must be corrected prior to permit termination. Any
deficiencies are discovered the permittee will be notified in writing within
thirty (30) days of receiving the NOT. When the site meets the termination
criteria, the NOT should be re-submitted.
      (h)   Release of warranty of improvements. One (1) year following the
installation of permanent vegetation, the owner may request the Public Works
Department check the vegetation on site and if it is found to have seventy-five
percent (75%) coverage and be in good condition the warranty of improvements
will be released. If it is discovered that the vegetation is not established,
the warranty of improvements must be kept by the city until such time as the
vegetation is well established. Should the warranty of improvements be in the
form of a letter of credit, upon receiving notice that the letter of credit
needs to be renewed the owner will provide the Public Works Department with a
letter of credit for an additional year.
   (9)   Checklist.
      (a)   Have a pre-application meeting with the Public Works Department.
      (b)   You need three (3) sets each of: grading plan, erosion and sediment
control plan, and drainage plan.
      (c)   One (1) set of drainage/detention calculations.

14-704. Stormwater system design and management standards.
   (1)   Stormwater design or BMP manual.
      (a)   Adoption. The municipality adopts as its stormwater design and best
management practices (BMP) manual the following publications, which are
incorporated by reference in this chapter as is fully set out herein:
         (1)   TDEC Sediment and Erosion Control Handbook; most current
edition.
         (2)   Title 14, Chapter 7, § 14-712.
         (3)   Tennessee Permanent Stormwater Management and Design Guidance
Manual; most current edition.
         (4)   Other MS4 approved BMP manuals that comply with the goals of the
MS4 Permit and/or the Construction General Permit (CGP) may be chosen by the
city and a current list is available from the Public Works Department.
      (b)   These manuals include lists of acceptable BMPs including the
specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements
for each stormwater practice. These include city approved BMPs for permanent
stormwater management including green infrastructure BMPs. These manuals may be
updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body
of the municipality, upon the recommendation of the Public Works Department,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance
experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with these BMP criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum
water quality performance standards.
   (2)   General performance criteria for stormwater management. The following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
      (a)   All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater
discharge associated with design storms specified in this chapter or as
specified by the City of Cookeville Stormwater Management Design Guidelines and
reduce the generation of post construction stormwater runoff to pre-
construction levels. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for
stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent
practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. All
stormwater management facilities that are required under §
14-608  of the Cookeville Municipal Code, and the Cookeville Zoning Code and
Subdivision Regulations and which are approved after the adoption of this
chapter shall be built to control water quality by using the best management
practice outlined in this section. Other methods of controlling water quality
may be approved by the Director of Public Works if valid documentation is
provided which indicates an equivalent or higher level of water quality will
result from the alternate method. Due to the city's NPDES MS4 permit stormwater
management requirements are periodically changed, therefore specific
requirements for detention and water quality will be found in the City of
Cookeville Stormwater Management Guidelines.
      (b)   To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manual.
      (c)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, swimming areas, recharge areas, water supply
reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
      (d)   Stormwater discharges from "hot spots" may require the application
of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. In addition,
stormwater from hot spot land use may not be infiltrated.
      (e)   Prior to or during the site design process, building permit
applicants shall consult with the Public Works Department to determine if they
are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
      (f)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the MS4 BMP
manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.
   (3)   Minimum control requirements.
      (a)   Stormwater designs shall meet the multi-stage storm frequency
storage requirements as identified by the City of Cookeville Stormwater
Management Design Guidelines, unless the Public Works Department has granted
the applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP under §
14-707 .
      (b)   If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Public Works
Department may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to
control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (4)   Permanent stormwater management plan requirements. The stormwater
management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the Public Works
Department to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site,
the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and
future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the
measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To
accomplish this goal the stormwater management plan shall include the
following:
      (a)   Topographic base map: A topographic base map (2 foot contour
intervals) to a suitable scale of the site which extends a minimum of 100 feet
beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates:
         (1)   Existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds,
culverts, ditches, sink holes, wetlands; and the type, size, elevation, etc.,
of nearest upstream and downstream drainage structures;
         (2)   Current land use including all existing structures, locations of
utilities, roads, and easements;
         (3)   All other existing significant natural and artificial features;
         (4)   Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface
area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities,
roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading;
      (b)   Proposed structural BMPs;
      (c)   A written description of the site plan and justification of
proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required.
      (d)   Calculations: Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the
pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storms specified
in the BMP manual. These calculations must show that the proposed stormwater
management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in
compliance with this chapter and the guidelines of the BMP manual. Such
calculations shall include:
         (1)   A description of the design storm frequency, duration, and
intensity where applicable;
         (2)   Time of concentration;
         (3)   Soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients including assumed soil
moisture conditions;
         (4)   Peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed
area;
         (5)   Infiltration rates, where applicable;
         (6)   Culvert, stormwater sewer, ditch and/or other stormwater
conveyance capacities;

needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   (3)   Conflicting standards. Whenever there is a conflict between any
standard contained in this chapter and in the BMP manual adopted by the
municipality under this chapter, the strictest standard shall prevail.
(as added by Ord. #004-06-11, July 2004, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,

14-709. Penalties.
   (1)   Violations. Any person who shall commit any act declared unlawful
under this chapter, who violates any provision of this chapter, who violates
the provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, or who fails or
refuses to comply with any lawful communication or notice to abate or take
corrective action by the Public Works Department, shall be guilty of a civil
offense.
   (2)   Penalties. Under the authority provided in Tennessee Code Annotated §
68-221-1106, the municipality declares that any person violating the provisions
of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the Public Works Department
of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
   (3)   Measuring civil penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the director
of the Public Works Department may consider:
      (a)   The harm done to the public health or the environment;
      (b)   Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic
deterrent to the illegal activity;
      (c)   The economic benefit gained by the violator;
      (d)   The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy this
violation;
      (e)   Any unusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by the
municipality;
      (f)   The amount of penalty established by ordinance or resolution for
specific categories of violations; and
      (g)   Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of
imposing any penalty or damage assessment.
   (4)   Recovery of damages and costs. In addition to the civil penalty in
subsection (2) above, the municipality may recover:
      (a)   All damages proximately caused by the violator to the municipality,
which may include any reasonable expenses incurred in investigating violations
of, and enforcing compliance with, this chapter, or any other actual damages
caused by the violation.
      (b)   The costs of the municipality's maintenance of stormwater
facilities when the user of such facilities fails to maintain them as required
by this chapter.
   (5)   Other remedies. The municipality may bring legal action to enjoin the
continuing violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at
law or equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.
   (6)   Remedies cumulative. The remedies set forth in this section shall be
cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil
or criminal, that one (1) or more of the remedies set forth herein has been
sought or granted.
(as added by Ord. #004-06-11, July 2004, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,

14-712.  Stormwater Management Guidelines.
   (1)   General Provisions.
      (a)   These guidelines will outline the way storm water detention and
green infrastructure will be calculated. Storm water detention is a necessary
part of most storm water treatment BMPs and is required for most developments.
      (b)   The Storm Water Ordinance of the City of Cookeville is posted at
the City of Cookeville Public Works Department's website and must be read by
anyone attempting to perform storm water calculations with the City of
Cookeville. It contains provisions for fees, right-of-entry, definitions,
easements and penalties. A major purpose of the Storm Water Ordinance is to
improve water quality, storm water quantity as well as comply with the city's
NPDES Permit for Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems
(MS4).
      (c)   Due to the MS4 permit requirements, projects over one (1) acre in
disturbed area require additional controls; therefore the guidelines are
separated into two (2) categories: one for projects less than one (1) disturbed
acre and another for projects with more than one (1) disturbed area.
      (d)   Storm water detention is required for any new development or re-
development containing 5,000 square feet or more of impervious area.
(Cookeville Municipal Code §
14-608, Cookeville Zoning Code, Cookeville Subdivision Regulations). Where
additions to the existing impervious area of the site bring the total area of
impervious surface to 5,000 square feet or more, only the additional impervious
area is required to provide detention.
      (e)   Storm water detention is defined as limiting the peak discharge
rate for the post developed conditions to be no greater than the peak discharge
rate for the predevelopment conditions. This must be accomplished using the two
(2)-year, five (5)-year, and ten (10)-year storms. The estimated design
rainfall amounts for either twenty-four (24)-hour depths or intensities for any
duration, can be found by accessing the following NOAA National Weather Service
Atlas 14 data for Tennessee:
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_map_cont.html
      (f)   Redevelopment of property shall be evaluated using one of the
following methods unless otherwise determined by the Public Works Department:
         i.   Rational method – evaluate the pre-development conditions using
the appropriate meadow/pastureland runoff coefficient or as existing
conditions; the more conservative condition shall be used.
         ii.   USDA Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55) – evaluate the pre-
development conditions as either grassland conditions or existing conditions;
the more conservative conditions shall be used.
   (2)   Projects Disturbing Less Than One Acre.
      (a)   The first flush volume is defined as the first one (1) inch of
direct runoff from the impervious areas of the contributing drainage basin. The
first flush volume must be captured and released over a minimum of twenty-four
(24) hours and a maximum of seventy-two (72) hours. No first flush runoff of
impervious surfaces shall bypass the treatment facility. Storm water recharge
by infiltrating the first flush volume into the soil on site is the preferable
method of first flush treatment. Infiltration may be accomplished by the use of
bioretention basins, rain gardens, bio swales, green parking for overflow lots,
or other methods pre-approved by the Director of Public Works or his designee.
Infiltration of the first flush may not be possible if the site is located on
unsuitable soils. Where infiltration of storm water is not possible or ill
advised, treatment of the first flush is defined as a practice or structure
that removes eighty percent (80%) total suspended solids (TSS) and other
anticipated pollutants such as oil and grease.
      (b)   A dry detention basin must have a minimum of two percent (2%) slope
in the bottom of the basin in order to drain properly. Side slopes should
generally be three to one (3:1) (H:V) or flatter, unless traversable access has
been designed.
      (c)   All hydrological and hydraulic computations for storm water
detention facilities must be prepared and stamped by a registered engineer
(licensed in the state of Tennessee) and proficient in this field. Plans must
show sufficient information to enable the builder to construct the facility as
required.
      (d)   Underground detention is the use of large underground structures to
provide necessary volumes for attenuating storm water peak flows. Underground
structures generally provide little or no storm water quality benefits. The
following minimum requirements must be met before an underground storage
facility will be considered for approval:
         i.   The underground detention structure must provide adequate access
for inspection from the surface. Public safety must be considered.
         ii.   The underground detention structure must be constructed of
durable materials with a typical one hundred (100)-year lifetime. Detention
storage volume shall not include the porous space within a stone or gravel bed
without soils reports stamped by a geotechnical engineer stating that
infiltration into the soils should exceed one-half inch (1/2") per hour
infiltration rate.
         iii.   The underground detention structure shall be designed to have
positive drainage into the receiving channel or storm water sewer assuming
there is a ten (10)-year flood in the receiving facility.
         iv.   The underground detention structure shall not receive surface
runoff directly from parking lots. Surface water shall be directed to a BMP
that improves water quality such as an oil/water separator, grass filter strips
(of sufficient size to filter the water quantity), or a proprietary water
quality devise approved by the Public Works Department.
         v.   Design measures must be taken to trap and store sediments in
locations where cleanout and maintenance can be easily performed. This
generally requires that some type of water quality inlet or other storm water
treatment BMP must be installed upstream from the underground detention
facility. Proprietary water quality devices must be approved by the Public
Works Department.
         vi.   A detailed maintenance and inspection plan must be submitted and
approved (including inspection schedules and guidelines). Evidence of
responsibility and financial budgeting must be presented.
   (3)   Projects Disturbing More Than One Acre. Projects disturbing more than
one (1) acre for new and redevelopment will be required to meet the site design
standards set out by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
(TDEC) for compliance with the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit as well as minimum volume controls.
      (a)   Site design standards for all new construction and redevelopment
disturbing one (1) acre or more must use, in combination or alone, storm water
management measures that are designed, built and maintained to infiltrate,
evapotranspire, harvest and/or use the first inch of every rainfall event
preceded by seventy-two (72) hours of no measurable precipitation. This first
inch of rainfall must be one hundred percent (100%) managed with no discharge
to surface waters.
      (b)   Storm water management measures that are often referred to as green
infrastructure that can infiltrate the first inch of rainfall are the goal that
TDEC is aiming for that they term runoff reduction. Green infrastructure
includes many practices including: rain gardens, bioretention, infiltration
swales, etc.
      (c)   Some sites are not suitable for infiltration methods and
infiltration requirements may be set aside on such sites, with prior agreement
by the Public Works Department. Limitations to using runoff reduction methods
include, but are not limited to:
         i.   Where the potential for introducing pollutants into the ground
water exists, unless pretreatment is provided;
         ii.   Where pre-existing soil contamination is present in areas
subject to contact with infiltrated runoff;
         iii.   The presence of sinkholes or other karst features on the site
or in close proximity;
         iv.   Insufficient infiltration capacity of soils;
         v.   An extensive presence of shallow ground water table, shallow
bedrock or other restrictive layers;
         vi.   Presence of contractive or expansive soils in close proximity to
structures.
      (d)   Pre-development infiltration capacity of the soils at the site must
be taken into account in selection of runoff reduction management measures.
      (e)   Incentive standards for redevelopment sites: a ten percent (10%)
reduction in volume of rainfall to be managed for any of the following types of
development. Such credits are additive such that a maximum reduction of fifty
percent (50%) of the standard one (1) inch is possible for a project that meets
all five (5) criteria:
         i.   Redevelopment.
         ii.   Brownfield redevelopment.
         iii.   High density (> 7 units per acre).
         iv.   Vertical density (> 18 units per acre).
         v.   Mixed use.
      (f)   For all projects that cannot meet one hundred percent (100%) of the
one (1) inch runoff reduction requirement unless subject to the incentive
standards, the remainder of the one (1) inch rainfall must be treated prior to
discharge with a practice or technology documented to remove eighty percent
(80%) total suspended solids (TSS). The treatment practice or technology must
be designed, installed and maintained to continue to meet this performance
standard.
      (g)   In addition to the runoff reduction requirement for the one (1)
inch rainfall minimum volume controls are required to detain those storms
greater than one (1) inch in depth.
      (h)   A dry detention basin must have a minimum of two percent (2%) slope
in the bottom of the basin in order to drain properly. Side slopes should
generally be three to one (3:1) (H:V) or flatter, unless traversable access has
been designed.
      (i)   All hydrological and hydraulic computations for storm water
detention facilities must be prepared and stamped by a registered engineer
(licensed in the state of Tennessee) and proficient in this field. Plans must
show sufficient information to enable the builder to construct the facility as
required.
      (j)   Underground detention is the use of large underground structures to
provide necessary volumes for attenuating storm water peak flows. Underground
structures generally provide little or no storm water quality benefits. The
following minimum requirements must be met before an underground storage
facility will be considered for approval:
         i.   The underground detention structure must provide adequate access
for inspection from the surface. Public safety must be considered.
         ii.   The underground detention structure must be constructed of
durable materials with a typical one hundred (100)-year lifetime. Detention
storage volume shall not include the porous space within a stone or gravel bed
without soils reports stamped by a geotechnical engineer stating that
infiltration into the soils should exceed one-half inch (1/2") per hour
infiltration rate.
         iii.   The underground detention structure shall be designed to have
positive drainage into the receiving channel or storm water sewer assuming
there is a ten (10)-year flood in the receiving facility.
         iv.   The underground detention structure shall not receive surface
runoff directly from parking lots. Surface water shall be directed to a BMP
that improves water quality such as an oil/water separator, grass filter strips
(of sufficient size to filter the water quantity), or a proprietary water

         v.   Design measures must be taken to trap and store sediments in
locations were cleanout and maintenance can be easily performed. This generally
requires that some type of water quality inlet or other storm water treatment
BMP must be installed upstream from the underground detention facility.
Proprietary water quality devices must be approved by the Public Works
Department.
         vi.   A detailed maintenance and inspection plan must be submitted and
approved (including inspection schedules and guidelines).

14-801. General provisions.
   Riparian buffer zones serve as natural boundaries between local waterways
and development and help to protect water resources by filtering pollutants,
providing infiltration of stormwater runoff, providing wildlife habitat,
stabilizing the banks and restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of the water resources.
   It is the desire of the City of Cookeville to protect and maintain the
native vegetation in riparian areas by the implementation of specifications for
the establishment, protection and maintenance of vegetated buffers along all
water resources within the city. These provisions apply to all lots which are
contiguous with or directly adjoin water bodies determined to meet the
definition of streams, ponds, wetlands, springs, reservoirs or lakes. These
provisions are applicable to permanent riparian buffer zones and are not
referring to temporary construction buffer zones as required by the Tennessee
Construction General Permit, those buffer zones are required by state law and
are separate and covered by separate ordinances.
(as added by Ord. #08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,
February 2015)
14-802. Definitions.
   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
Words used in the singular shall include the plural, and the plural shall
include the singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future
tense. The words “shall” and “will” are mandatory and not discretionary. The
word "may" is permissive. Words not defined in this section shall be construed
to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in the latest
edition of Webster's Dictionary.
   "BMPs" or "Best Management practices" are physical, structural and/or
managerial practices that, when used singly or in combination, prevent or
reduce pollution of water, that have been approved by the City of Cookeville,
and that have been incorporated by reference into the city stormwater
ordinances. [Note: see §
14-704(1) for recommended BMP manual.]
   "Channel" means a natural watercourse with a definite bed and banks that
conducts flowing water continuously or periodically.
   "Dumping" means the introduction of material into the riparian buffer zone
which could wash into the stream or otherwise cause contamination of the
stream.
   "Filling" means the deposit of earth by artificial means.
   "Grading" means the operation of raising or lowering the ground surface to a
predetermined elevation datum.
   "Impervious" means not allowing the passage of water through the surface of
the ground or ground covering, or a substantial reduction in the capacity for
water to pass through the surface of the ground or ground covering.
   "Right-of-way" is land over which a road, railroad, etc. passes.
   "Riparian" relating to, or living on the bank of a river, stream, lake,
wetland, etc.
   "Riparian buffer" is an undisturbed area, measured from top of bank of water
resource, which consists of a riparian zone comprised of native vegetation,
original or re-established, bordering streams, ponds, wetlands, springs,
reservoirs or lakes or other water resources designated by the state as
requiring a riparian buffer.
   "Stabilize" means to provide adequate measures, vegetative and/or
structural, that will prevent erosion from occurring.
   "Stream" is a linear surface water that is not a wet-weather conveyance as
determined by a qualified hydrological professional.
   "Stripping" means the removal of existing vegetation or soils.
   "Wet weather conveyance" is a man-made or natural watercourse, including
natural watercourses that have been modified by channelization, that flow only
in direct response to precipitation runoff in their immediate locality, whose
channels are above the groundwater table and which do not support fish and
aquatic life and are not suitable for drinking water supplies, and in which
hydrological and biological analysis indicate that, under normal weather
conditions, due to naturally occurring ephemeral or low flow there is not
sufficient water to support fish, or multiple populations of obligate lotic
aquatic organisms whose life cycle includes an aquatic phase of at least two
(2) months. Determination of what channels are wet weather conveyances may be
made by a qualified hydrological professional.
   "Wetlands" are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
ground water at a frequency or duration sufficient to support, and under normal
circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typical to life in
saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include, but are not limited to,
swamps, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands are designated by federal or state
organizations with this responsibility.
(as added by Ord. #08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,
February 2015)
14-803. Standards for buffer zones.
   The following standards shall apply for all riparian buffer zones:
      A.   The vegetated buffer shall begin at the ordinary high water level
and break in slope of the water resource.
      B.   The riparian buffer width shall depend upon the size of the drainage
area for the project. Streams and other waters with drainage areas of less than
one square mile will require buffer widths of 30 feet minimum. Streams or other
waters with drainage areas of greater than one square mile will require buffer
widths of 60 foot minimum. The required width for buffer zones may be averaged
at the discretion of the Public Works Department but under no circumstances
will the buffer zone be allowed to be less than one half the minimum width
given above, for the size of watershed.
      C.   The vegetative target for the riparian buffer is undisturbed native
vegetation with woody vegetation (i.e. trees and shrubs) being the dominant
plant form along the banks.
      D.   There shall be no septic systems, permanent structures or impervious
cover within the riparian buffer zone.
(as added by Ord. #08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,
February 2015)
14-804. Buffer zone management and maintenance requirements.
   The following requirements shall apply for the management and maintenance of
riparian buffer zones:
      A.   The riparian buffer zone shall be managed to enhance and maximize
the unique value of these resources. Management includes specific limitations
on alteration of the natural conditions of these resources. The following
practices or activities are not allowed within the buffer zone:
         1.   Soil disturbance by grading, stripping or other practices.
         2.   Filling or dumping.
         3.   Use, storage or application of herbicides, except for spot
spraying of noxious weeds or non-native species.
         4.   Storage or operation of motorized vehicles, except for
maintenance and emergency use approved by the Public Works Department.
      EXCLUSION: Any project that has received a state or federal permit
(including but not limited to Aquatic Resource Alteration Permits (ARAP), 401
or 404 permits) will be excluded from those requirements of this policy that
are superceded by requirements of the state or federal permits.
      B.   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted in
the buffer zone, with specific design or maintenance features, subject to the
review of the Public Works Department.
         1.   Individual trees within the buffer zone may be removed which are
in danger of falling, causing damage to dwellings or other structures, or
causing blockages in the stream.
         2.   Roads, bridges, paths and utilities:
            a.   The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to allow
for maintenance access and installation.
            b.   The angle of the crossing shall be perpendicular to the stream
or buffer in order to minimize clearing requirements.
            c.   A minimum number of road crossings should be used within each
subdivision, and no more than one stream crossing is allowed for every 1000
feet of buffer.
         3.   Stormwater management:
            a.   In new development, on-site and non-structural alternatives
will be preferred over larger facilities within the stream buffer. When
constructing stormwater management facilities (i.e. BMPs), the area cleared
will be limited to the area required for construction and adequate maintenance
access, as outlined in the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
            b.   Material dredged or otherwise removed from a BMP shall be
stored outside the buffer.
         4.   Stream restoration projects, facilities and activities approved
by Public Works are permitted within the riparian buffer zone.
         5.   Water quality monitoring and stream gauging are permitted within
the stream buffer zone, as approved by the Public Works Department.
(as added by Ord. #08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01,
February 2015)
14-805. Exemptions.
   These provisions shall apply to all proposed development except for that
development which prior to the effective date of this policy:
      A.   Is covered by a valid, unexpired plat in accordance with development
regulations.
      B.   Is covered by a valid, unexpired building permit. (as added by Ord.
#08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01, February 2015)
14-806. Variances and modifications.
   The Public Works Director may reduce or modify the requirement for a stream
buffer zone for projects which will not result in disturbance of the land or
where on-site conditions clearly demonstrate that the site is not now occupied
by riparian habitat vegetation and would not effectively respond to riparian
re-vegetation. An applicant requesting such a waiver shall submit sufficient
information to substantiate the request to waive the requirement. (as added by
Ord. #08-01-02, Feb. 2008, and amended by Ord. #015-01-01, February 2015)
14-807. Enforcement.
   A.   Enforcement authority. The director of the Public Works Department
(hereafter referred to as director) or his or her designees shall have the
authority to issue notices of violation and citations, and to impose the civil
penalties provided in this section.
   B.   Notification of violation.
      1.   Written notice. Whenever the director finds that any permittee or
any other person has violated or is violating this chapter, the director may
serve upon such person written notice of the violation. Within fourteen (14)
days of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted to the director. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation.
      2.   Consent orders. The director is empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the person to correct
the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent
orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued
pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) below.
      3.   Show cause hearing. The director may order any person who violates
this chapter, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The hearing shall be before the Public Works director. Notice shall be
served on the person specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a request that
the violator show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be

   (1)   “A Class A wrecker” is a towing vehicle designed to tow passenger
cars, pick-up trucks, small trailers, etc. This classification also includes

manufacturer's capacity of 35,000 lbs. or greater GVWR.
   (4)   “An on-call wrecker service” is a towing business listed on a rotating
schedule after voluntarily complying with the standards and requirements
herein. An on-call wrecker service is available to provide towing services at
the request of an officer of the Cookeville Police Department. These requests
may involve services rendered at arrest scenes, crash scenes, for roadway
obstructions, and for the actions specified in
Title 15, Chapter 6, Parking and
Title 15, Chapter 7, Enforcement.
   (5)   “Garage keeper's liability” is insurance that protects a garage keeper
against liability for damage to vehicles in his/her care, custody, or control.
   (6)   “On hook coverage” is insurance that will normally pay to repair or
replace a vehicle that the towing company did not own if it is damaged by a
collision, fire, theft, explosion, or vandalism while it is being towed or
hauled.
   (7)   “Vehicle liability” is insurance that pays for damages due to bodily
injury and property damage to others for which the towing company is
responsible.  (Ord. #O17-10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-804.  Application for on-call wrecker service.
   (1)   Before any person, firm, or corporation may conduct an on-call wrecker
service in the City of Cookeville, he or she shall file with the Cookeville
Police Department an application for a permit. Applicants and all partners
shall also meet the driver's permit qualifications outlined in §
15-809. The application shall include the name of the on-call wrecker service,
address and phone number; applicant name, home address and phone number;
whether the applicant is an individual, firm, or corporation, and if a firm,
the name, home address and phone number of each member thereof. The applicant
will also be responsible for any other fees that are associated with the
application or background investigation process. The application shall also
include the following: the make, model, vehicle identification number (VIN),
and license number of all vehicles proposed to be used by the on-call wrecker
service; the color scheme or insignia to be used to designate the vehicle or
vehicles; experience of the applicant in the transportation or towing of
vehicles; certification of the mechanical reliability and cleanliness of the
vehicles by a Cookeville Police Department approved inspector; certification of
liability insurance; and such other pertinent information as may be required on
said form, which application shall be sworn to by the applicant and notarized.
   (2)   All permits for conducting an on-call wrecker service shall be issued
and signed by a representative designated by the Cookeville Police Department.
No on-call wrecker service permits shall be issued for a longer period than one
(1) calendar year. The designated representative of the Cookeville Police
Department may issue a permit for a shorter or probationary period if the
designee deemed it proper. All on-call wrecker service permits are subject to
cancellation at any time by the Cookeville Police Department. Permits issued
under this section are nontransferable.
   (3)   All permits heretofore issued shall expire annually. The applicant
must file a renewal application and ensure that all fees have been paid and all
vehicles have been inspected consistent with the administrative regulations of
the Cookeville Police Department so that the application for renewal can be
acted upon by the Cookeville Police Department. Failure to comply with the
provisions of this section shall result in immediate suspension of all permits
held by the on-call wrecker service owner.
   (4)   No permits, initial or renewal, for an on-call wrecker service shall
be issued unless a current business license has been obtained from the City of
Cookeville. Any on-call wrecker service that conducts regular business within
the Cookeville city limits must have their office located within the Cookeville
city limits in an area zoned for such a business.
   (5)   Every on-call wrecker service permitted under this chapter shall post
the permit in such a place in each wrecker as to be in full view while such
wrecker is in operation.
   (6)   The Cookeville Police Department shall have authority to issue
administrative regulations that are not in conflict with this chapter governing
the use and operation of wreckers. Provided, however, that any owner of an on-
call wrecker service, as of the effective date of this chapter, that does not
meet the requirement of §
15-809 may continue to be an owner unless (1) the owner is convicted of a
felony; pleads guilty to a felony; or pleads "no contest" (nolo contendere) to
a felony; or (2) ceases to be an owner. In the event of (1) the owner
immediately forfeits the permit. In the event of (2) the owner must meet all
criteria set forth in §
15-809 to obtain a new permit to be an owner. Nothing in this paragraph may be
construed to permit an owner under this exception to be a driver.  (Ord. #O17-
10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-805.  Application/renewal fee.
   At the time of issuance of a permit to operate an on-call wrecker service,
the holder of the permit shall pay to the Cookeville Police Department a
nonrefundable fee in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25). This fee shall
also apply for each annual renewal application. If at any time the holder of a
towing permit shall desire to use any additional vehicles under the permit, he
or she may do so only after he or she has made application to the Cookeville
Police Department for a permit to use such additional vehicles and he or she
shall furnish to the Cookeville Police Department the same information
regarding such additional vehicles as is required in §
15-804 regarding those vehicles covered by the original permit.  (Ord. #O17-10-
19, Dec. 2017)
15-806.  Liability insurance required.
   Each on-call wrecker service assumes the liability for personal injury or
property damage resulting from the towing company's employee's intentional or
negligent act(s) beginning at the time contact is made with any vehicle to be
towed. Each towing company assumes full liability for all items of value in the
towed vehicle. Each towing company shall maintain the following insurance
policies for the minimum amounts set forth in this section. Each policy shall
be in the name of the towing company or the towing company's owner and shall
include coverage for towing and storage. The policy(s) shall be valid for at
least six (6) months. However, no lapse in insurance coverage may occur.
   Liability coverage must be equal to (or greater than) the minimum amounts
below.

comply with the requirements of the administrative regulations of the
Cookeville Police Department. The designee of the chief of police will schedule
the date and time the inspections shall be made.
   (2)   A police officer is authorized by this chapter to stop a wrecker
operating on the streets of the City of Cookeville when the mechanical
appearance of the vehicle so warrants or to inspect said vehicle for compliance
with the administrative regulations of the Cookeville Police Department. If
said officer finds the vehicle to be in noncompliance with this chapter, he or
she shall notify the on duty shift commander. The shift commander may place the
wrecker out of service until repairs have been made and the vehicle has been
re-inspected as provided in §
15-807.  (Ord. #O17-10-19, Dec. 2017)

Police Department, all operators of a Class A or B wrecker must be in
possession of a Class D Driver License with an "F" endorsement or a Commercial
Driver License issued by the State of Tennessee. Additionally, any person
driving a Class C wrecker must be in possession of a Commercial Driver License
issued by the State of Tennessee.
   (2)   All operators of an approved on-call wrecker service must be able to
present a valid wrecker driver's permit upon request while operating a wrecker
at the request of a police officer.
   (3)   No driver's permit shall be issued for a longer period than one (1)
calendar year. Said driver's permit will be renewable with the on-call wrecker
service date as provided in §
15-804.  (Ord. #O17-10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-809.  Qualifications for driver's permit.
   No person shall be issued a wrecker driver's permit or an on-call wrecker
service permit unless he or she passes a background investigation. Applicants
must be of good character and not have been convicted of, pled guilty to, or
entered a plea of "no contest" to any felony offense or any misdemeanors that
involve crimes of violence, theft, fraud, sale or distribution of drugs, bodily
injury, or other crimes of dishonesty. A written application must be submitted
to the Cookeville Police Department on forms provided for that purpose. The
application shall contain such pertinent information as deemed necessary by the
Cookeville Police Department. If the application is deemed to be incomplete or
contains incorrect or false information, it shall be summarily denied.
Additional direction can be found in the administrative regulations promulgated
by the Cookeville Police Department.  (Ord. #O17- 10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-810.  Rate Schedule for Nonconsenting Towing at the Direction of a Law
Enforcement Officer.
   (1)   The following base rates and fees of each schedule class wrecker will
apply to any vehicle stored on the City’s impound lot other than those stored
for evidence purposes:
 
Wrecker Maximum Rate per Town Storage Rate per Day
Class A $130.00               $30.00
Class B $230.00               $30.00
Class C $440.00               $50.00
 
   After the first two (2) hours on the lot, any part of a day shall count as a
whole day of storage. The preceding fees will be evaluated as needed.
   (2)   The following additional fees may apply in the situations described
below:
   Labor charges for the operation of the non-consent on-call wreckers shall
not start until after the first hour for Class A and B wreckers. Such charges
will not start until after the first two (2) hours for a Class C wrecker.
Hourly rates can only be charged for non-consent on-call wreckers in use on
scene after being requested by a law enforcement officer and arriving on scene.
The additional hourly rate for Class A wreckers may not exceed fifty dollars
($50) per hour. The additional hourly rate for Class B wreckers may not exceed
one hundred dollars ($100) per hour. The additional hourly rate for Class C
wreckers may not exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125) per hour.
   Mileage charges may only be incurred for out of county miles and only when
towing at a police officer's request. This rate is not to exceed three dollars
and fifty cents ($3.50) per mile.
   In cases where a police officer requests an on-call wrecker service to
respond to an unattended vehicle, the owner or operator of the vehicle shall
not be charged any fee if the owner or operator arrives and removes the vehicle
to be towed from the premises before it is connected to the towing vehicle. If
the owner or operator of the vehicle is present after the towing vehicle has
been connected to the vehicle to be towed, the vehicle shall not be towed but
the owner or operator of the vehicle shall be liable for a reasonable fee, in
lieu of towing, provided the owner or operator of the vehicle forthwith removes
the vehicle from the premises. A vehicle shall be deemed connected if every
procedure required securing the vehicle to the wrecker or wrecker equipment so
that the vehicle may be safely towed has been completed at the time the owner
or operator arrives, including the attachment of any safety chains. The drop
fee for Class A or B wreckers may not exceed fifty dollars ($50). The drop fee
for a Class C wrecker may not exceed one hundred forty dollars ($140).
   An on-call wrecker service may charge an after-hours retrieval fee not to
exceed fifty dollars ($50) if the owner or operator of a towed vehicle needs to
access property in their vehicle or recover their vehicle after the vehicle has
been towed to the lot of an on-call wrecker service after normal business
hours. Normal business hours will be defined as being Monday through Friday
from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. If the owner or operator of a vehicle being towed is
on scene when an on-call wrecker service responds, the operator of the wrecker
will be expected to give the owner or operator of the towed vehicle an
opportunity to retrieve any needed property in the vehicle at the scene.
Likewise, the wrecker operator will be responsible for notifying the owner or
operator of the towed vehicle that additional fees may apply if the towed
vehicle must be accessed or released after normal business hours.  (Ord. #O17-
10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-811.  Wrecker driver—Duty to remove accident debris. 
   Whenever any driver of a wrecker removes a vehicle from the scene of an
accident on the streets, alleys, roads, highways, or thoroughfares within the
City of Cookeville, it shall be the duty of such driver and driver assistant to
simultaneously remove and carry away from the streets, alleys, roads, highways,
and thoroughfares at or about the scene of each accident or collision, all
glass, metal, and debris which may have been cast upon the streets, alleys,
roads, highways, and thoroughfares as a result of the accident or collision as
required in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 55-8-170.  (Ord. #O17- 10-19, December
2017)

which result in the injury or death to any person or damage to any property in
an amount exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) shall be reported
within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of the occurrence to the department
of Cookeville City police on a form to be furnished by the department.  (Ord.

15-813.  Towing place designated.
   (1)   The driver of the wrecker shall tow, transport, or convey the vehicle
to be towed to any place designated by the owner or operator of such vehicle.
It is unlawful for the owner, driver, or driver assistant of a wrecker or an
agent, employee, or representative of the owner or driver of a wrecker at the
scene of the accident to pressure or otherwise coerce or insist that the owner
or operator of a vehicle sign a work order or agreement at the scene of the
place from which the vehicle is to be transported for any repairs to be made on
such vehicle.
   (2)   The driver of the wrecker shall in all cases, before moving the
vehicle to be towed, ask the owner or operator of such vehicle the place to
which he or she desires the vehicle to be taken and shall transport such
vehicle to such place upon the towing charges being paid or secured. Otherwise,
the vehicle shall be towed or transported to the wrecker service operator's
storage lot.
   (3)   If the vehicle to be towed or transported is involved in an accident
and the owner or operator thereof is unable to give any instructions in his own
behalf, the driver of the wrecker shall tow or transport the wrecked vehicle to
the wrecker service operator's storage lot and it will be presumed and
considered prima facie evidence that the owner or operator of such vehicle
consents to and desires that his vehicle be towed or transported to such place.
   (4)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle is not available and a wrecker
has been summoned by a Cookeville city police officer as a result of a parking
violation, then the vehicle shall be towed or transported to the city police
tow-in lot or to the storage area of the permittee if the police officer so
orders.  (Ord. #O17-10-19, Dec. 2017)
15-814.  Storage facility requirements.
Each site to which vehicles are towed shall comply with the following
requirements, and no wrecker operator may take a vehicle to a storage lot which
does not meet these standards.
   (1)   No towing company shall tow a vehicle from private property under
orders of one not the owner of the vehicle to a storage lot which is outside
the geographic limits of the City of Cookeville. All permittees shall
immediately upon connecting the towing vehicle to a vehicle to be towed from
private property under orders of one not the owner of such vehicle, tow the
vehicle directly to a storage lot owned or operated by such permittee located
within the geographic limits of the City of Cookeville. Such towed vehicle
shall not be dropped or left at any other lot or on any other property without
the consent of the owner for any period of time. No towed vehicle shall be
stored on a public street.
   (2)   A storage site shall be fenced or enclosed on all sides in a manner
consistent with the administrative regulations described in the Cookeville
Zoning Code.
   (3)   The operator shall exercise reasonable care to keep towed vehicles and
their contents secure at all times.
   (4)   Personal property in vehicles must be released in accordance with
state law.
   (5)   Whenever a storage lot is closed or has a gate locked, a conspicuous
sign must be posted at the entrance of the storage lot which provides
instructions and a local telephone number for obtaining release of a vehicle
when the lot is not open. The local telephone number posted shall be answered
twenty-four (24) hours a day and someone must be available at the storage lot
to release vehicles within a reasonable time after inquiry is made.
   (6)   Any person operating an on-call wrecker service and maintaining a
storage lot shall maintain personnel with authority to accept payment and to
release any impounded vehicle available seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24)
hours a day. If such actions occur outside the normal business hours outlined
in §
15-810, personnel must be available within a maximum one (1) hour period to
release or provide access to a vehicle upon the request of the owner.
   (7)   There shall be posted at the entrance to the impound lot nearest the
impound lot office a sign, at least twenty-four (24) inches by twenty-four (24)
inches, painted or printed white with red lettering the towing charge, the
storage rate per day, that no storage fee may be charged if the vehicle has
been held less than two (2) hours and that these conditions are required by
ordinance of the City of Cookeville Government. In addition, such sign shall
list the two (2) forms of payment accepted and state that no additional fee may
be charged for noncash payment.  (Ord. #O17-10-19, Dec. 2017)

   This chapter sets uniform requirements for discharges into the wastewater
collection and treatment system and enables the City of Cookeville to comply
with the administrative provisions of the Clean Water Act, PL 92-500, and the
applicable effluent limitations, national standards of performance, toxic and
pretreatment effluent standards, and any other discharge criteria which are
required or authorized by state or federal law, and to derive the maximum
public benefit by regulating the quality and quantity of wastewater discharged
into the Cookeville Sewer System. This chapter provides a means for determining
wastewater volumes, constituents and characteristics, and the issuance of
permits to certain users, in order to:
   (1)   Prohibit and/or regulate the contribution of wastewater which may
cause operational or maintenance difficulties or deterioration of the sewers,
force mains, pumping stations and other structures appurtenant to the
wastewater treatment system as hereinafter defined;
   (2)   Establish control of the contribution of wastewater which requires
greater treatment expenditures that are required for equal volumes of normal
domestic waste;
   (3)   Establish pretreatment requirements for industrial waste before
discharge to public sewers as required in 40 C.F.R., Part 403, as amended;
   (4)   Establish a uniform procedure for design, installation, inspection,
operation and maintenance of private wastewater treatment and disposal systems,
extension of public sewer systems, laterals and connections to sewer mains.

      (b)   No person or user shall discharge any waters or wastes which cause
the wastewater leaving the POTW to exceed any established by the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation.
   (4)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Upon the promulgation of federal
categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the
federal standard, if more stringent than the limitations imposed under this
section for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the
limitations imposed under this section. The affected user shall come into
compliance with said limitations within the time allotted in the Federal
Categorical Regulation.
   (5)   Limitations on strength. It is the intent of this chapter to regulate
all discharges of compatible wastes in excess of the concentrations shown below
based on composite samples:
 
Constituent    Daily Average Concentration  (mg/l)
BOD5           300

   (6)   Exceptions. Nonresidential users of the Cookeville Sewer System may
apply for an exception to the Restricted Discharge limitations listed in
subsection 3(a) of this section. Exceptions can be granted according to the
following guidelines subject to the appeals procedure provided in §
18-211 :
      (a)   All exceptions granted under this paragraph shall be temporary and
subject to revocation at any time by the Control Authority upon a reasonable
notice.
      (b)   The user requesting the exception must demonstrate to the Control
Authority that he is making a concentrated and serious effort to maintain high
standards of operation control and housekeeping levels, etc., so that
discharges to the Cookeville Sewer System are being minimized. If negligence is
found, permits will be subject to termination.
      (c)   The user requesting the exception must demonstrate that compliance
with stated concentration and quantity standards is technically or economically
infeasible and the discharge will not:
         (i)   Interfere with the normal operation of the Cookeville POTW.
         (ii)   Limit the sludge management alternatives available and increase
the cost of providing adequate sludge management.
         (iii)   Pass through the POTW in quantities and/or concentrations that
would cause the POTW to violate its pass-through limits or NPDES permit.
      (d)   The user must agree in writing that, should the discharge cause any
of the occurrences listed in paragraph (c) above, the discharge shall be
immediately discontinued.
      (e)   The user must show that the exception, if granted, will not cause
the discharger to violate any federal pretreatment standards, including
categorical standards if applicable, unless the exception is granted under
provisions of the applicable pretreatment regulations.
      (f)   At such time that the levels of pollutants must be reduced because
of violations of any of the provisions of section 3(b) above, all users shall
be required to reduce their discharge levels by a sufficient amount to meet the
standard being violated. Users shall be required to reduce their discharge
levels in accordance with their contribution to the system.
   (7)   Other restrictions. No statement in this chapter is intended or may be
construed to prohibit the Control Authority from establishing specific
wastewater discharge criteria more restrictive where wastes are determined to
be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the Cookeville Sewer System,
create a public nuisance, cause the discharge of the Cookeville Sewer System to
violate effluent or stream quality standards, or exceed industrial pretreatment
standards for discharge to municipal wastewater treatment system as imposed or
as may be imposed by the State and/or the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.
   (8)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges,
if applicable, shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than the
federal requirements and limitations or the requirements and limitations of
this chapter.
   (9)   Right of revision. The City reserves the right to establish more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed
necessary to comply with the objectives presented in §
18-201  of this chapter.
   (10)   Protection from accidental discharge. Each user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge into the sewer of prohibited materials or
other wastes regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Control Authority for review, and shall be approved
by the Control Authority before construction of the facility.
   The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
   (11)   Prohibition of dilution. No User shall ever increase the use of
process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation. The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on
Users who are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or in
other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (12)   Prohibition of extraneous water. It shall be unlawful for any
builder, contractor, property owner, or other persons to cause or permit
surface water, storm water, ground water, rain water, street drainage, roof
drainage, basement drainage, subsurface drainage or yard drainage from any
source whatsoever to be emptied into any sanitary sewer, either directly or
indirectly.
   (13)   Prohibition of unpolluted water. Unpolluted water shall not be
discharged through direct or indirect connections to a sewer line unless such
discharge is expressly allowed in the users discharge permit.
   (14)   Other prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for any person to place,
deposit, or permit to be deposited in any sewer or manhole any item or object
which would interfere with the operation of the POTW, including but not limited
to wood, rock, stone, improperly shredded garbage or any other refuse or solid
wastes.
   (15)   Limitations on garbage grinders. Waste from garbage grinders shall
not be discharged into the POTW except where such grinders are installed as a
part of a residential dwelling, unless written approval is obtained from the
Control Authority. Such approval may be revoked at any time by the Control
Authority, if so desired. Such grinders must shred the waste to a degree that
all particles will be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in
the POTW sewers. Garbage grinders shall not be used for the grinding of
plastics, paper products, inert materials or garden refuse.
   (16)   Limitations on point of discharge. No person shall discharge any
substance directly into a manhole or other opening in a POTW sewer other than
through an approved building sewer unless he shall have been issued a permit by
the Control Authority. The user shall be required to pay all applicable permit
fees and charges.
   (17)   Private sewage disposal. The disposal of sewage by means other than
the use of the available sanitary sewage system shall be in accordance with
local, county and state law. The disposal of sewage by private disposal systems
for new construction shall be permissible only in those instances where service
from the sanitary sewage system is not available.
   (18)   Carnivals, circuses, and transient groups. Whenever carnivals,
circuses, or other transient groups of persons come within the area of the City
of Cookeville such groups of transients shall provide a sanitary method for
disposal of sewage and human excrete. Failure to provide such sanitary method
of disposal and to make all reasonable changes and corrections proposed by the
Control Authority shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   (19)   Tampering with sewer facilities. It shall be unlawful for any person
to tamper or interfere with any of the sewage facilities of the city or to make
improper connections thereto so as to evade, or attempt to evade, the payment
of lawful service and connection charges to the city.
   Any person tampering with or interfering with the sewage facilities of the
city shall be presumed to have done so with the intent to evade or attempt to
evade the payment of lawful service and connection charges to the city.
   (20)   Access to customer's premises. Identified City employees shall have
access to customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of
reading meters, testing repairing, removing, or exchanging any or all equipment
belonging to the Department of Water Quality Control.
   Also, the Director, and other duly authorized employees of the Department of
Water Quality Control bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be
permitted to enter all private properties through which this city holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved.
   (21)   Interruption of service. The city shall not be liable for any damage
resulting from failure or overflow of any sewer main, service pipes or valve,
or by discontinuance of the operation of its wastewater collection, treatment
and disposal facilities, for repair, extensions, or connections or from the
accidental failure of the wastewater collection, treatment and disposal
facilities from any cause whatsoever. In cases of emergency the City shall have
the right to restrict the use of its wastewater collection, treatment and
disposal facilities in any reasonable manner for the protection of the City and
the Cookeville Sewer System.

days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in
the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance as
determined by the Control Authority.
      (e)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation and shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or
changed operation.
   (2)   Sampling and analytical requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be
conducted in accordance with procedures established by the administrator
pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 as
amended. All reports of sampling and analysis shall identify the analytical
method used as well as the person's name who conducted the sampling and
analysis.
   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For sampling required in support of
baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which no historical history
is available. For facilities with historical data available for grab samples,
the POTW may authorize a lower minimum. For all other pollutants, 24-hour
composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the POTW. Where time-proportional composite sampling is
authorized by the POTW, the samples must be representative of the discharge and
the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the
Industrial User's file.
   (3)   Reporting requirements, (a) Permit limit violations. If sampling
performed by an Industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation and shall provide
written notice of the violation within 5 days of becoming aware of the
violation. This written notice shall include an explanation of the cause of the
violation, and steps being taken to correct the violation and prevent future
violations. Such notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any
damage caused to the POTW by the discharge, or from any enforcement action
which may be taken by the city as a result of the violation.
      The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis for the parameter(s)
violated and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within
30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
      Reporting requirements for Industrial Users upon effective date of
Categorical Pretreatment Standard-Baseline Report.
      Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical Pretreatment
Standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a
category determination submission under Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(1)(d),
whichever is later, existing Industrial Users subject to such categorical
Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which
contains the following information listed in subparagraphs (i)-(vii) of this
paragraph. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources,
and sources that become Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical Standard, shall be required to submit to the Control
Authority a report which contains the information listed in subparagraphs (i)-
(vii) of this paragraph. New Sources shall also be required to include in this
report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to
meet applicable pretreatment standards. New Sources shall give estimates of the
information requested in subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this paragraph:
         (i)   Identifying Information. The User shall submit name and address
of the facility including the name of the operator and owners.
         (ii)   Permits. The User shall submit a list of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.
         (iii)   Description of Operations. The User shall submit a brief
description of the nature, average rate of production, and Standard Industrial
Classification of the operation(s) carried out by such Industrial User. This
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points
of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
         (iv)   Flow Measurement. The User shall submit information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from regulated process streams and other streams as necessary to allow the use
of the combined waste stream formula of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5). The
Control Authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where
justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
         (v)   Measurement of Pollutants.
            (A)   The User shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable
to each regulated process.
            (B)   In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants
in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentration shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. In cases where the Standard required compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as
required by the Control Authority or the applicable Standards to determine
compliance with the Standard.
            (C)   The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            (D)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other waste streams are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5) in order to evaluate compliance
with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternative concentration has been
calculated in accordance with Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5) this adjusted
limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Control Authority.
            (E)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Administrator of the EPA determines that
the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical
procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties,
approved by the Administrator of the EPA.
            (F)   The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
            (G)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place,
of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (vi)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized
representative of the Industrial User and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/
or additional pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. This certification must state that the
information submitted is to the best of the authorized representatives
knowledge and belief to be true, accurate, and complete per Tennessee Rule
0400-40-14-.06(1)(b)2.
         (vii)   Compliance Schedule. If additional Pretreatment and/or
Operation and Maintenance will be required to meet Pretreatment Standards; the
shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional
pretreatment or Operation and Maintenance. The completion date established for
the applicable Pretreatment Standard shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard.
      (b)   POTW Sampling of Industrial Users. The POTW will sample in lieu of
the Industrial User. The POTW will work with a lab to ensure all pollutants
within the Industry's permit are sampled according to their permit. The
sampling reports will be forwarded to both the Industrial User and POTW for
review. The POTW has the ultimate control of the sampling requirements,
procedures, and schedule; however, the Industrial User will also evaluate the
sampling reports and sign stating whether the Industrial User is in violation.
The Industrial User is still required to oversee their sampling reports to
ensure their awareness of their discharge parameters in relation to their
Industrial permit and to certify that they are operating within their permit
limits. Control Authority approval is required for an Industrial User to
monitor and schedule its own sampling with a lab.
      (c)   Permit limit violations. If sampling performed by the POTW/
Industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24
hours of becoming aware of the violation and shall provide written notice of
the violation within 5 days of becoming aware of the violation. This written
notice shall include an explanation of the cause of the violation, and steps
being taken to correct the violation and prevent future violations. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any damage caused to
the POTW by the discharge, or from any enforcement action which may be taken by
the city as a result of the violation.
      The POTW/Industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis for
the parameter(s) violated and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Control Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Repeat
analysis is not required if:
         (i)   The POTW/User samples the Industrial User at a frequency of at
least once per month, or
         (ii)   The POTW/User performs sampling at the Industry between the
time of initial sampling and the time when the POTW/User receives the results
of this sampling.
      (d)   Schedule. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance
with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of new
sources, within 90 days of commencement of discharge, any industrial user
subject to the categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the Control
Authority, a report containing the information described in subparagraphs (2)
(d)-(f) of Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.12. The report shall state whether the
applicable categorical standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary
to bring the user into compliance. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the user, and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional Operation and Maintenance (O
& M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet
the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
      The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Industrial User to
meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards. Not later than 14 days
following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the
Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority
including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Control Authority.
      (e)   Periodic compliance reports. All significant industrial users whose
discharge is monitored, are required to submit to the Control Authority
monitoring reports at the intervals specified in the users permit. The reports
should be received in the office of the Department no later than the 15th day
of the month following the reporting period. This report shall contain the
results of all sampling and analyses, performed in accordance with § 18-206(2),
of the discharge for the reporting period, as well as all flow measurements,
even if the sampling is performed more frequently than required. This report
shall include a statement that the information submitted is to the best of the
authorized representatives knowledge and belief to be true, accurate, and
complete per Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(1)(b)2. The report shall be signed
by an authorized representative of the user. Any violations detected during
self-monitoring are subject to the reporting requirements of §
18-206 (3)(c).
      In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best
Management Practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the User shall
submit documentation required by the POTW or Pretreatment Standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the User in the same month in which the
compliance/monitoring report is due. These reports must be based on sampling
and analysis performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto.
      The Industrial User shall be required to retain for a minimum of 3 years
any Best Management Practice records or records of monitoring activities and
results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this rule)
and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the POTW.
The period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved
litigation regarding the Industrial User or POTW or when requested by the POTW.
      (f)   Notice of discharges. Significant Industrial Users are required to
notify the POTW immediately of any changes to its facility affecting potential
for a slug discharge. Users shall notify the Control Authority immediately upon
accidental discharge or slug discharge in violation of this chapter to enable
countermeasures to be taken to minimize damage to the POTW and the receiving
waters.
      This notification shall be followed within five (5) days of the date of
occurrence by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the
violation and a plan including specific required actions for the satisfactory
correction of the violation and prevention of future violations of the same
nature. Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense,
loss, or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant, or treatment process, or
for any penalties or fines imposed on the city on account thereof under state
and federal law.
      (g)   Notice to employees. In order that employees of users be informed
of the City's requirements, users shall make available to their employees
copies of this chapter together with such other wastewater information and
notices which may be furnished by the Control Authority from time to time
directed toward more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be
furnished and permanently posted on the user's bulletin board advising
employees whom to call in case of a violation of this chapter. Employees shall
be informed that immediate reporting of accidental and slug discharges is
required.
      (h)   Discharge of hazardous wastes. All industrial users shall notify
the Control Authority, the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation, Division of Solid Waste Management and the EPA Region IV Waste
Management Division Director in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261 (RCRA). The notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other).
      If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimate of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastewater expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months.
      Notification shall be provided within 180 days of discharge. Notification
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged; however,
advance notification of substantial change is required.
      Industrial users are exempt from notification requirements if:
         (i)   The pollutants are already monitored and reported under the
user's permit requirements; or
         (ii)   Less than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes are
discharged within a calendar month.
         If new regulations identify additional characteristics of hazardous
wastes or list new hazardous wastes, notification of the appropriate
authorities by the industrial user is required within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
         If notification is required, the industrial user shall certify that it
has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined economically feasible.
         (iii)   Additional sampling. All sampling performed in accordance with
40 CFR part 136, by an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of
a pretreatment permit shall submit the results for all sampling. This includes
sampling that is done in addition to the required sampling of the users permit.
   (4)   Pretreatment.
      (a)   Criteria for pretreatment. Any wastewater discharge from a
significant industrial user whose discharge violates EPA regulations, any
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or the limitations set out under
§§
18-204 (2) and
18-204 (3) of this chapter shall pretreat at the point of origin in a private
wastewater treatment plant provided, maintained and operated by the owner.
      Any discharge exceeding only the "limitations on strength" provisions of
this chapter (§
18-204(5)) may be pretreated at the point of origin in a private wastewater
treatment plant provided, maintained and operated by the owner, or the user may
pay the applicable surcharge as contained in §
18-207(6).
      (b)   Design and construction. All users who elect or are required to
construct new or additional facilities for pretreatment shall submit at least
two complete sets of plans, specifications, and other pertinent information
relative to the proposed construction to the Control Authority for approval.
Plans and specifications submitted for approval must bear the seal of a
professional engineer registered to practice engineering in the State of
Tennessee. Written approval from the Control Authority must be obtained before
construction of new or additional facilities may begin. The plans,
specifications, and other pertinent information submitted to the city for
approval will be retained as file material for future reference with one
approved copy returned to the user.
      (c)   New pretreatment facilities for existing sources. In the event new
or additional pretreatment facilities for existing sources are required under
the provisions of this chapter, the user shall be issued a compliance schedule
for completion of the facilities. This compliance schedule shall include
milestone deadlines for completion of design, start of construction, completion
of construction, start-up of facilities and full compliance with all
limitations. During the compliance schedule time period, the industrial user
shall submit written progress reports to the Control Authority not less often
than every three months. In the event the user is making a good faith effort to
comply but is prevented from compliance due to circumstances beyond the user's
control, deadlines may be extended by the Control Authority. Time limits
imposed by federal pretreatment regulations shall take precedence over any
compliance schedule issued by the city.
      (d)   Inspection of facilities. A permit for the operation of a new or
existing pretreatment or equalization system shall not be issued until and
unless the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the Control
Authority and written approval for operation is issued to the owner by the
Control Authority. The Control Authority shall be allowed to inspect the work
at any state of construction. The applicant for the permit shall notify the
Control Authority when the work is ready for final inspection.
      (e)   Maintenance of facilities. It shall be the responsibility of the
owner to maintain all wastewater treatment or equalization facilities in good
working order at all times. The Department of Water Quality Control must be
notified in writing when pretreatment facilities will not be or are not
operative by reason of equipment malfunction, emergency, routine maintenance,
or any reason whatsoever. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to repair
and maintain all pretreatment facilities on a high priority basis.
   (5)   Monitoring facilities. All significant industrial users shall be
required to install a monitoring facility (a monitoring facility is a manhole
or other suitable facility approved by the Control Authority which includes a
metering device with suitable accommodations for composite sampling). When, in
the judgment of the Control Authority, there is a significant difference in
wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of
a single user, the Control Authority may require that separate monitoring
facilities be installed for each separate source of discharge.
   Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewaters produced by a user. If
sampling or metering equipment is also required by the Control Authority it
shall be provided and installed at the user's expense. Such sampling equipment
shall be required by the Control Authority only after sampling by the city
establishes the existence of significant variations in concentrations or
constituents of the user's discharge.
   Operation, maintenance, sampling, and testing shall be performed by the
Control Authority at the user's expense. Wastewater samples will be made
available to the industry if requested.
   The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The Control Authority may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
monitoring facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with
the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of the right-of-way. The
monitoring facility shall be located, so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, special accommodation
must be made so City personnel can have access without communicating with plant
personnel before entry, such as for surprise sampling visits.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities
shall be constructed in accordance with the Control Authority's requirements
and all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications.
When, in the judgment of the Control Authority, an existing user requires a
monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must
be completed within 180 days following written notification unless an extension
is granted by the Control Authority.
   (6)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
      (a)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Control Authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease from food establishments or grease, petroleum,
grit, or other harmful ingredients from any other establishment; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units.
      (b)   Grease interceptors shall be sized and installed according to the
Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) Management Program as it currently exists and
amended in the future. The FOG Management Program is available at the City of
Cookeville Department of Water Quality Control and on the Department's website.
The FOG Program, developed by the Control Authority, may also have requirements
for design specifications for interceptors, acceptable manufactures for "under
sink" interceptors, cleaning frequency, and reporting requirements for
interceptor pumping and/or cleaning.
      (c)   The Control Authority will determine the minimum capacity and
specifications for interceptors for establishments that produce or handle
grease or fluid, grit, or other floatable or settable pollutants not covered by
the FOG Management Program based on the process and flow.
      (d)   When a grease or sand interceptor is required for an existing user,
the user shall be notified in writing by the Control Authority. Grease and sand
interceptors required for existing users shall be installed within 90 days of
notification.
      (e)   Interceptors shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning
and inspection. Such interceptors shall be routinely inspected, pumped,
cleaned, and repaired as necessary for proper operation of the interceptor and
in accordance with the City's FOG Management Program by the User at their
expense.
      (f)   Manifests for pumping and hauling the waste from the interceptor
shall be kept on file at the facility for a minimum of 3 years.
      (g)   Facilities that do not pump their interceptor on a routine basis,
causing overflows or blockages within the sanitary sewer collection system,
will be required by the Control Authority to pump said interceptor on a
compliance schedule determined by the Control Authority. Pump manifests shall
be submitted to the Control Authority for a period of time to be determined by
the Control Authority.
   (7)   Inspection. The Control Authority and representatives of the State and
EPA bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter
all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   The facilities of any user may be inspected to ascertain whether the
purposes of this chapter are being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Control Authority as well as representatives of the
State and EPA ready and immediate access at any time to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection or sampling or in the performance of any
of their duties. The Control Authority shall have the right to set up on the
user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering
operations.
   If, during an inspection of his facility, the user is found to be in
violation of his discharge permit, then such user shall be financially
responsible and shall pay for any and all damages, including sampling and
analytical costs.
   (8)   Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties
referred to in the above paragraph, the Control Authority shall observe all
safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user, and the user
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Department of Water Quality
Control employees, unless the owner/occupier of the property caused injury,
death or damage.
   (9)   Revocation of permit. Any user who violates any condition of his
permit, this chapter, or any applicable state and federal regulations is
subject to having his permit revoked. Violations which may result in permit
revocation include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (a)   Intentional failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
      (b)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations for
wastewater characteristics;
      (c)   Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or,
      (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   (10)   Waiver for Pollutant Sampling. The POTW may authorize the Industrial
User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial
User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is
present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in
the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
      (a)   The POTW may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the Permit, but in no case longer than 5 years. The
Industrial User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can
be granted for each subsequent control mechanism.
      (c)   In making a demonstration that is a pollutant is not present, the
Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for the
monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph, and include the certification statement in Tennessee Rule 0400-40-
14-.06(l)(b)2. Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present is the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was
used in the analysis.
      (d)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the POTW must be included as
a condition in the User's control mechanism. The reason's supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the POTW for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
      (e)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's
control mechanism by the POTW, the Industrial User must certify on each report
with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in
its waste stream due to activities of the Industrial User:
      Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR [specify
applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since
filing of the last periodic report under Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.12(5)(a).
      (f)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present based on changes that occur in the User's operations,
the User must immediately; notify the POTW and begin monitoring/reporting for
said pollutant per requirements specified by the specified National
Pretreatment Standard.
      (g)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017)
18-207. Charges and fees.
   (1)   Purpose of charges and fees. A schedule of charges and fees shall be
adopted by the City Council which will enable the Department of Water Quality
Control to comply with the revenue requirements of Section 204 of the Clean
Water Act. Charges and fees shall be determined in a manner consistent with
regulations of the federal grant program to ensure that sufficient revenues are
collected to defray the city's cost of operating and maintaining adequate
wastewater collection and treatment systems and to provide sufficient funds for
capital outlay, bond service costs, capital improvements and depreciation.
   (2)   Classification of user. All users are to be classified by the Control
Authority either by assigning each one to a user classification category
according to the principal activity conducted on the user's premises, by
analyzing each individual user, or by a combination thereof. The purpose of
such collective and/or individual classification is to facilitate the
regulation of wastewater discharges based on wastewater constituents and
characteristics, to provide an effective means of source control, and to
establish a system of charges and fees which will insure an equitable recovery
of the city's cost. Any charges and fees not stated in this chapter shall be as
determined by the City Manager. A schedule of these fees can be obtained at the
City of Cookeville Department of Water Quality Control or on the Department's
website.
   (3)   Type of charges and fees. The charges and fees established by the city
may include, but, not be limited to:
      (a)   User classification charges;
      (b)   Fees for monitoring, maintenance, and analysis;
      (c)   Fees for permit applications;
      (d)   Surcharge fees;
      (e)   Discharge permit fees; including permits for discharging holding
tank waste;
      (f)   Charges and fees based on wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
      (g)   Fees for garbage grinders;
      (h)   Fees for holding tank wastes;
      (i)   Fees for reimbursement of administrative costs related to the
pretreatment program;
      (j)   Fees for reviewing accidental discharge prevention procedures and
construction;
      (k)   Fees for allowing connection of building sewers to the POTW.
      (l)   Fees for plans review and construction inspection.
   (4)   Computation and assessments. The computation of and assessment of
surcharges, monitoring charges, maintenance charges and testing or analysis
charges shall be subject to the appeals procedure provided in this chapter.
   (5)   User rates.  (a) Basis of determination of rates. Charges and fees for
sewer service are based on normal domestic wastewater with the following
characteristics:
 
BOD5             300 mg/l
COD              800 mg/l
TKN              60 mg/l
NH3-N            30 mg/l
Suspended Solids 300 mg/l
Oil and Grease   100 mg/l
 
   The charges and fees for all wastewaters which exceed the concentrations for
normal domestic wastewater shall be based upon a surcharge as in §
18-207(6).
      (b)   User charge system. The user charge system consists of a flat base
charge based on an equitable distribution of the administrative costs of
providing sewer service to all customers connected to the POTW and to each lot,
parcel of land or premise which may now or hereinafter be located within one
hundred (100) feet of a sanitary sewer owned by the city, plus an equitable
distribution of the cost of operating expenses, debt amortization and
depreciation to all customers connected to the POTW based on water usages as
determined by the water meters owned by the city. A surcharge will be levied
against those users which discharge wastewater that exceeds the strength of
"normal wastewater". The owner or occupant of property obtaining water from a
source or sources other than through a meter of the city and discharging said
water into the POTW shall install, without cost to the city, a meter or meters
to measure the quantity of water received from any such source or sources and
shall pay the same sewer rate or rates as customers utilizing water provided by
the city. No meter shall be installed or used for such purpose without the
approval of the Control Authority. The City may use readings from water meters
owned by other utilities instead of requiring another meter be installed.
      Whenever a property upon which the sewer user charge is imposed uses
water for industrial, commercial or air conditioning purposes and does not
discharge said water into the POTW but, through agreement with the POTW,
discharges it in some other manner, including discharging it into the city's
storm sewer system, the quantity of water used and not discharged into the POTW
shall, be excluded in determining the sewer service charge for said property.
However, the quantity of water used and not discharged into the POTW must be
measured by a device or meter approved by the director and installed by the
owner or occupant without cost to the city.
      (c)   Review of rates. The Department shall review annually in
conjunction with budget evaluations the wastewater contribution of users and
user classes, the total cost of operation and maintenance of the POTW and the
user charge system. The City shall revise the charges for users or user classes
to accomplish the following:
         (i)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among user and user classes as required herein;
         (ii)   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the
POTW; and,
         (iii)   Apply excess revenues collected from a class of user to the
cost of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year
and adjust the rate accordingly.
   (6)   Surcharges for high strength wastewater. A surcharge will be assessed
for waste containing compatible pollutants in concentrations greater than those
for "normal wastewater". The surcharge shall be based on the average analytical
results of not less than two (2) unannounced composite samples collected at the
monitoring manhole during the month. However, a surcharge for holding tank
wastes shall be based on a representative grab sample. Samples shall be
collected and analyzed by Department personnel at the POTW treatment plant, or
by an authorized independent laboratory when required by the Control Authority.
Sample collection and analysis shall be in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 as
amended.
   The following formula shall be used to determine the amount of the
surcharge:
SURCHARGE = SBOD + SCOD + STSS + STKN + SNH3 + SO&G
      where,
SBOD     =  surcharge for BOD
     =  MWU * 8.34 * (DC-NC) * $0.15
SCOD     =  surcharge for COD
     =  MWU * 8.34 * (DC-F1) * $0.05
STSS     =  Surcharge for Total Suspended Solids
     =  MWU * 8.34 * (DC-NC) * $0.15
STKN     =  Surcharge for Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen
     =  MSB * {'{'}(DC/NC)- 1{'}'}
SNH3     =  surcharge for Ammonia Nitrogen
     =  MSB * {'{'}(DC/NC) - 1{'}'}
SO&G     =  Surcharge for Oil and Grease
     =  MSB * {'{'}(DC/NC) - 1{'}'}
   and where,
   F1   =  the larger of (DCBOD) * 2.5 or 800 mg/l
   MSB   =  Monthly Sewer Bill (dollars)
   MWU =  Monthly Water Usage (million gallons)
   DC   =  Concentration of the subject parameter discharged (mg/l)
   NC   =  Concentration of the subject parameter in "normal wastewater" (mg/l)
Only the parameters determined to be present will be included in a pretreatment
permit and therefore subject to a surcharge. The surcharge shall be added to
the customer's monthly bill.
   (7)   Sampling and analysis. Users who are required by the Control Authority
to have sampling and flow monitoring devices installed (temporary or permanent)
shall be charged to compensate the City for operating and maintaining equipment
and for performing analytical tests on their discharge. The charge will be
assessed in accordance with this chapter.
   (8)   Recovery for damages. Any person violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall become liable to the City of Cookeville for any expense,
loss or damage resulting to the City of Cookeville by reason of such violation
including but not limited to labor and material costs resulting from any
remedial action required by the city, court costs and reasonable attorney's
fees, expert witness expenses, and court reporter fees, or, in addition, any
other penalties, fines, charges or assessments.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017)
18-208. Administration.
   (1)   Billing and payment policies. Statements of account for sewer service
shall be rendered monthly by the Department of Water Quality Control. Where the
customer obtains both services the two (2) charges shall be placed on the same
bill and will be rendered to the customer together and the customer shall pay
the total bill for both water and sewer service within fifteen (15) days from
the date of the bill at the City Hall, Cookeville, Tennessee. In the event of
failure by the customer to pay the bill rendered for water and/or sewer, the
said customer shall be given at least five (5) days' notice of intention to
discontinue service, said notice to provide that if the charges for which the
customer is delinquent are not paid within the said period, the Cookeville
Department of Water Quality Control will discontinue water service to said
customer. In the event of discontinuance of water service by the Department by
reason or failure to pay either the water or sewer charge, said service shall
not be restored to the customer until any and all delinquencies for water and
sewer service have been paid, together with any and all connection charges or
reconnection charges owed by the customer to the Department. In the event the
service is discontinued for failure to pay the statements as rendered to the
customer, service shall not be restored until such time as the customer has
paid any balance of delinquent account for water and/or sewer service
remaining, together with any or all connection or reconnection charges.
   (2)   Adjustment of bills. In the event of a leakage or wastage of water by
the improper functioning of equipment beyond the point of service which results
in abnormally high bills for water and/or sewer service, and upon proper
assurance to the Department that said leakage or wastage has been repaired or
eliminated, the customer's bill will be adjusted by an amount to be determined
by averaging the bills for water and sewer service for the three (3) months
immediately prior to the beginning of said leakage by subtracting this amount
from the bill for which adjustment is desired, and adjusting said bill by one-
half (½) of the result, provided however, that the adjustment will be made for
only one month's bill, the month to be determined by the customer. If it can be
determined that the nature of the water leak was such that the water could not
have gotten into the sewer system, the sewer bill shall be adjusted to reflect
the normal charge for the period when there is abnormal water usage. Such sewer
charge adjustment shall be made for a period of not to exceed three (3)
consecutive months and shall be made only when the following conditions are
met:
      (a)   The Department is aware, either through customer notification or
internal system monitoring, of abnormal water usage;
      (b)   Application is made within three (3) months of restored normal
usage for an adjustment; and
      (c)   After notification to the customer of abnormal usage the customer
can document that reasonable efforts were made to curtail the abnormal usage.
      Property owners are able to receive an adjustment, for sewer only, one
time per calendar year for filling their swimming pool in an amount equal to
the volume of the swimming pool as long as the drain line does not connect to
the city's sewer system.
   (3)   Sewer rates. The sewer rate charge for normal domestic wastewater is
based on the wastewater discharge to the Cookeville Sewer System as measured by
the public water supply meter or meters, and/or by any supplementary meter or
meters, necessary to measure the amount of water discharged. Property owners
must purchase an irrigation meter to prevent charges for sewer usage based on
their water consumption through their residential, commercial, or industrial
water meter. If a meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to
be tested or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the
City reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best
information available. The Control Authority also reserves the right to require
metering of any water discharged into the sewer system.
   The charges listed below shall be assessed to all users regardless of
whether they are serviced by an individual or a master water meter, or
regardless of whether they are connected to the sewer as long as sewer service
is considered to be available under the conditions set forth in this chapter.
The following rates are net:
   Effective May 1, 2019–Each residence and place of business within the
corporate limits of the City of Cookeville, Tennessee, shall pay the following
rates per 1,000 gallons:
   Zero usage (base charge)               $7.05
   All gallons over zero usage            $4.92 per 1,000 gallons
   Effective May 1, 2020–Each residence and place of business within the
corporate limits of the City of Cookeville, Tennessee, shall pay the following
rates per 1,000 gallons:

   Any sewer connections not listed above shall be computed on an individual
basis as deemed necessary by the City of Cookeville. Sewer service shall be
considered to be available if a sewer line is within one hundred (100) feet of
the customer's property and the living quarters of a residence or the work
areas of a commercial or industrial building can be connected. If sewer is
available, upon payment of the above charges the Department shall provide a
sewer connection at the customer's property line - the point of connection to
be determined by the Department. If sewer service is not considered available
the cost to extend sewer to the property shall be paid by the customer.
   Any cost of extending the sewer main shall be paid by the customer, except
for capital improvement or cost-sharing projects approved by the city council.
No sewer main or lateral shall serve property outside the City limits of
Cookeville unless approved by the City Council.
   Upon recommendation of the Director, and conditioned upon the availability
of departmental funds, the city council may approve a cost-sharing agreement
with the customer to extend a sanitary sewer main. The agreement shall apply
only to that section of the sanitary sewer main constructed between the
existing sanitary sewer main and a point on the customer's property approved by
the Director. The sanitary sewer main extension must comply with the
Department's master sewer plan or the Control Authority must approve the
proposed location of the extension. The Director shall contract for the payment
by the city of its share of the project costs upon such terms and conditions as
the Director deems appropriate.
   In single-family detached subdivisions/developments where the sewer system,
including laterals to the customer's property, has been installed by the
developer, the connection charge shall be $50. In single-family attached,
multi-family and all other developments where the sewer system, including
laterals to the customer's property, has been installed by the developer, the
connection charge shall be $50 plus $200 per restroom or unit as described in §
18-208(4). In subdivisions or developments, where the sewer main has been
extended through a cost-sharing agreement, approved by the city council, the
connection charge shall be the full price as noted in §
18-208(4) of the city code.
   (5)   Holding tank waste dischargers. Private contractors dumping septic
tank waste into the wastewater treatment plant shall pay a charge of $25.00 per
1,000 gallons or portions thereof to the city.
   Persons dumping other holding tank waste must provide an analysis and pay a
charge of $25.00 per 1,000 gallons or portion thereof plus any applicable
surcharge as contained in §
18-207.
   (6)   Other charges.  (a) Termination of service. Whenever service has been
discontinued by the Department for any reason set forth in this chapter, or a
trip is made for the purpose of discontinuing service for any such reasons, a
charge of ten dollars ($10.00) will be assessed.
      (b)   Restoration of service. Whenever service has been discontinued by
the Department for any reason set forth in this chapter a charge will be
assessed to restore service. This charge will be ten dollars ($10.00) for those
trips made before 2:00 p.m., and will be twenty dollars ($20.00) for those
trips made after 2:00 p.m.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017, and Ord. #O19-03-01, March 2019)
18-209. Private sewage disposal and holding tank wastes.
   (1)   Permit requirement. No person, firm, association, or corporation shall
clean out, drain or flush any septic tank or any other type of wastewater or
excreta disposal system into the POTW unless such person, firm, association or
corporation obtains a permit from the Control Authority to perform such acts or
services. Any person, firm, association or corporation desiring a permit to
perform such acts or services shall file an application on the prescribed form.
Upon any such application, said permit shall be issued by the Control Authority
when the appropriate fees have been paid and conditions of this chapter have
been met, providing the Control Authority is satisfied the applicant has
adequate and proper equipment to perform the services contemplated in a safe
and competent manner.
   (2)   Designated disposal location. Septic tank and holding tank waste shall
not be introduced into any manhole, sewer line, or any other part of the sewer
system except at the wastewater treatment plant and only during normal working
hours at the treatment plant unless otherwise directed by the Cookeville
Department of Water Quality Control.
   Before any holding tank waste is discharged a full disclosure of the waste
constituents must be made. All required testing of the waste shall be paid for
by the hauler.
   (3)   Revocation of permit. Failure to comply with all the provisions of
this chapter shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of such permit by the
Control Authority: The possession within the City limits of Cookeville by any
person of any motor vehicle equipped with a body type and accessories of a
nature and design capable of serving as a septic tank or wastewater or excreta
disposal system cleaning unit shall be prima facie evidence that such person is
engaged in the business of cleaning, draining, or flushing septic tanks or
other wastewater or excreta disposal systems within the City limits of
Cookeville.
   (4)   Fees. For each permit issued under the provisions of this Chapter a
service charge shall be paid to the Control Authority. Any such permit granted
shall be for one full calendar year or a fraction of the calendar year, and
shall continue in full force and effect from the time issued until the ending
of the calendar year unless sooner revoked, and shall be non-transferable. The
number of the permit granted here in under shall be plainly painted on each
side of each motor vehicle used in the conduct of the business permitted
hereunder.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017)
18-210. Sewer construction and connection.
   (1)   Building sewers. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any
connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or
appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the Control
Authority.
   The owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by
the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgement of
the Control Authority.
   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one building sewer.
   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when
they are found, on examination and/or test by the Control Authority, to meet
all requirements of this chapter.
   The customer shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of all
sewer facilities installed on private property. A clean-out shall be installed
at the property line at the point of connection to the sewer lateral, per the
Control Authority's sewer clean-out detail available through the Control
Authority's office. Maintenance of private sewer lines with no clean-out at the
point the sewer line leaves private property and is laid on a public right-of-
way, shall be the responsibility of the customer.
   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer,
and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
city.
   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer or shall be disposed of in a private disposal
system in accordance with local, county, or state law.
   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation
drains, area way drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to
the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules
and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the Control Authority before installation.
   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building
inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
building inspector or his representative.
   The city shall not be responsible for damage due to sewer back-up such as
main line broken, surcharge, etc., unless damage is caused by negligence on the
part of the Department.
   (2)   Public sewer specifications. The Control Authority shall establish the
city's specifications for construction of public sewers in conformance with the
rules and regulations for construction of public sewers as may be imposed by
the State and/or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These
specifications may be modified by the Control Authority as the need arises.
   Developers desiring to make extensions or additions to the Cookeville Sewer
System shall obtain approval of plans and specifications from the Cookeville
Department of Water Quality Control and the State. All public sewers connected
to the Cookeville Sewer System shall be constructed in accordance with the
City's specifications. The Department shall have the right to specify the size
and type of pipe to be installed and to inspect the laying of said pipe and to
refuse service if the installation is not made in accordance with acceptable
construction practices.
   (3)   Safety. All excavations for sewer installation shall comply with all
applicable OSHA standards so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017)
18-211. Enforcement.
   (1)   Enforcement guide. Whenever the Control Authority finds that a
violation of any provision of this chapter or any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained in this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or any
order issued hereunder has occurred, the Control Authority will initiate the
appropriate enforcement response as provided in the Department's Enforcement
Response Guide. The Enforcement Response Guide includes specific penalties for
violations as determined appropriate by the Control Authority.
   (2)   Notification of violation. Whenever the Control Authority finds that
any user has violated or is violating provisions of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the Control Authority may serve
upon said User written notice of the violation. Notice may be served on the
owner, user, and/or permit holder by certified mail, return receipt requested,
or any other means of communication that the city has available to notify the
party of said violation and the need for corrective action. Within five (5)
days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation and prevention of future
violations, including specific required actions, shall be submitted to the
Control Authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
   (3)   Administrative orders. Whenever the Control Authority finds that a
violation of any provision of this chapter or any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained in this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or any
order issued hereunder has occurred, the Control Authority may issue an
administrative order to direct users not complying with such prohibitions,
limits, requirements, or provisions to take any or all of the following
measures:
      (a)   Comply forthwith or in accordance with a time schedule set forth by
the Control Authority;
      (b)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
threatened violation;
      (c)   Surrender his applicable user's permit if ordered to do so after a
show cause hearing;
      (d)   Pay a civil penalty and/or damages; and/or,
      (e)   Such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
   (4)   Cease and desist order. When the Control Authority finds that a
discharge of wastewater has taken place in violation of prohibitions or
limitations of this chapter or the provisions of a wastewater discharge permit,
the Control Authority may issue an order to cease and desist, and direct the
user to comply forthwith within a specified time schedule, or to take
appropriate remedial or preventative action in the event of a threatened
violation.
   (5)   Injunction. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this chapter, a discharge permit or order, the Control Authority
may petition the Chancery Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent
injunction, or both, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of
such discharge.
   (6)   Termination of service. Termination of service for failing to pay the
monthly sewer bill shall be handled in accordance with §
18-208 (1). All other violations for which termination of service is deemed
necessary shall be administered according to this section.
   Violation of the user's application or agreement for service and failure of
payment of any obligation due to the city shall be termed grounds for
termination of service. Prior to termination of service for violation of the
application or agreement or nonpayment, the Control Authority shall notify, in
writing, the owner and/or tenant, if any, that service is intended to be so
terminated and afford the owner and/or tenant the opportunity to request a
hearing thereon if such request is made in writing within five (5) days of
receipt of notice. However, in the event of an emergency that, in the opinion
of the Control Authority, threatens harm to the facilities or endangers the
public's health, the Control Authority may immediately take action to terminate
service to the property.
   The Control Authority may immediately suspend sewer service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion
of the Control Authority, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, causes or may cause
interference at the POTW or causes or may cause the City to violate any
conditions of its NPDES permit.
   Any person notified of an emergency suspension of sewer service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge.
In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the emergency
suspension order, the Control Authority shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate disconnection of water service or severance of
the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment
to any individuals. A hearing shall be held by the Control Authority within
twenty-four (24) hours of an emergency disconnection order to allow the user an
opportunity to demonstrate to the Control Authority that the emergency
situation has been abated or corrected and that the danger to the facilities or
public health no longer exists. The Control Authority shall reinstate sewer
service and/or the wastewater discharge permit upon proof of the elimination of
the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any further occurrence shall be submitted to the Control Authority
within five (5) days of the date of occurrence.
   Such right to discontinue service shall apply to all service received
through a single tap or service, even though more than one customer or tenant
is furnished service therefrom, and even though the delinquency or violation is
limited to only one such customer or tenant. Discontinuance of service by the
Control Authority for any cause stated in this chapter shall not release the
customer from liability for service already received or from liability for
payments that thereafter become due under the minimum bill provisions or other
provisions of the customer's agreement.
   (7)   Legal action. Upon any indication of a lack of response to a duly
issued enforcement action, the matter will be referred to the city attorney for
appropriate legal action.
   (8)   Fines and Penalties. Each and every day in which a violation occurs or
continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Any fine or penalty provided for
in this chapter shall be in addition to damages to which the city may be
entitled, pursuant to other provisions of this chapter and as may otherwise be
provided by law.
      (a)   Civil penalties. Any person or user who violates any provision of
this chapter requirements or conditions set forth in permits duly issued, or
who discharges wastewater which causes pollution or violates any order,
prohibition, effluent limitation, national standard of performance,
pretreatment or toxicity standard, shall be subject to the penalties and
procedures provided for in "The Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1977",
Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 69-3-101 through 129 as amended. The Control
Authority may levy penalties of up to $10,000 per day for each violation. The
Enforcement Response Guide shall be used when administering penalties.
      (b)   Criminal penalties. Any person who willfully or negligently
violates any provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued
hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a
(penalty) of fifty ($50) dollars per violation per day.
      (c)   Falsifying of information. Any person or user who knowingly makes
any false statements, representation, record, report, plan or other document
filed with the Control Authority or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device required under this chapter is hereby
declared to be in violation of this code section and subject to the civil and/
or criminal liabilities.
   (9)   Failure to comply. The issuance of a notice of violation,
administrative order, or compliance schedule shall not relieve the recipient of
any penalties or fines that result from failure to comply with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (10)   Notification to public. The Control Authority shall publish annually,
in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice
within the jurisdictions served by (the POTW), a list of the Users which, at
any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant
Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (11)   Preventive measures. Any direct or indirect connection or entry point
for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system
shall be eliminated if deemed necessary by the Control Authority.
   (12)   Correction of violation. In order to enforce the provisions of this
chapter, the Control Authority, shall have the authority to correct any
violation hereof. The cost of such correction shall be added to any sewer
service charge payable by the user violating this chapter or the owner and/or
tenant of the property upon which the violation occurred, and the City of
Cookeville shall have such remedies for the collection of such costs as it has
for the collection of sewer service charges.
   (13)   Damages to facilities. When a discharge of wastes causes an
obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to the POTW facilities, the
Control Authority shall assess a charge against the user for the work required
to clean or repair the facility and add such charge to the user's sewer service
charge.
   (14)   Compliance schedules. When the Control Authority finds that a
discharge of wastewater is, or has been, taking place in violation of
prohibitions or limitations prescribed in this chapter or the wastewater
discharge permit requirements, or otherwise finds a violation of this chapter,
the Control Authority may require the user to submit for approval, with such
modifications as it deems necessary, a detailed time schedule of specific
actions which the user shall take in order to prevent or correct a violation of
requirements.
   (15)   Hearings/appeals. 
      (a)   Appeals board. 
         (i)   Members. The City Council shall appoint a five member board to
be known as the Sewer Regulations Appeals Board. Members shall be appointed for
three year terms; however, the terms of the initial board members shall be as
follows: one member for one year; two members for two years; and two members
for three years. All members appointed to fill expired terms shall serve for
three consecutive years thereafter, and no member of the Sewer Regulations
Appeal Board shall serve more than two full, three-year terms without a one-
year break. A member whose term has expired shall continue to serve until his
or her successor is appointed in the manner as herein provided. In the event of
death or resignation of a board member prior to expiration of his or her term,
a successor shall be appointed for the unexpired term in the same manner as the
deceased or retiring board member was appointed, and shall take office upon
appointment. Such successor board member shall be eligible for re-appointment
to two full terms. A chairman and vice chairman of the board shall be elected
by majority vote of the sewer regulations appeals board. The Director or his
designee shall serve as the secretary to the Sewer Regulations Appeals Board.
         (ii)   Powers of the board. The appeals board shall have the following
powers:
            (A)   To conduct hearings on appeals of decisions of the Director
in actions taken under and pursuant to this chapter.
            (B)   To issue subpoenas requiring attendance and testimony of
witnesses and production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
hearings before the board. This power may be exercised by the board on its own
initiative or upon application of the parties.
            (C)   To administer oaths. The chairman, vice-chairman or chairman
pro tern shall be authorized to administer oaths. All testimony before the
board shall be under oath.
            (D)   To prescribe such rules and regulations for the convening of
the board, the conduct of hearings and all matters pertaining to and in
furtherance of the authority and power herein granted.
            (E)   To review actions or decisions, other than the refusal of
applications for exceptions and/or conditions on discharge permits, to
determine if the decision, action or determination made by the Director is
reasonable and necessary to protect the POTW and/or to effectuate the
provisions of this chapter.
            (F)   To review actions involving refusal of application for
exceptions and/or conditions on discharge permits to determine whether or not
the party appealing said decision has met the conditions prescribed in this
chapter. In making this determination, the board may consider the following:
               1.   The cost of pretreatment or other types of control
techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction,
but prohibitive cost alone shall not be the basis for granting a variance;
               2.   The age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to
the extent that such factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater
discharge.
               3.   The process employed by the user and process changes
available which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge;
               4.   The engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or
other control techniques available to the user to improve the quantity or
quality of wastewater discharge.
      (b)   Hearings. Except in those emergency situations, as provided for
elsewhere in this chapter, the Director shall afford any user an opportunity
for a hearing to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. User shall be provided with not less than forty-eight (48) hours of
notice of such hearing. Notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). Such notice may be
served on any user, permit applicant or permit holder. Whether or not a duly
notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
      Any order of notice of violation shall become final and not subject to
review unless the person or persons named therein request, by written petition,
a hearing before the Sewer Regulations Appeals Board no later than thirty (30)
days after the date such is served.
      The Director's decision, action or determination, shall remain in full
force and effect during such period of appeal unless modified or suspended by
the Sewer Regulations Appeals Board.
      Any hearing held by the Sewer Regulations Appeals Board will be held
according to and in full compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-124.
(Ord. #O17-09-17, October 2017)
18-212. Miscellaneous provisions.
   (1)   Rules and regulations. The city is authorized to make, promulgate,
alter, amend, or repeal such rules and regulations as are reasonably necessary
to control the use of the Cookeville Sewer System. The violation of any such
rules and regulations shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   (2)   Severability. If any provision, paragraph, word, article or section of
this chapter is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections and chapters shall not be
affected and shall continue in full force and effect.

any loss or damage resulting from defects in the installation, wiring, or
appliances, or from accidents which may occur upon the customer's premises. An
inspection shall be required of old wiring if there is reason to question its
safe condition. If same is found to be unsafe, service may be discontinued
until such time as said wiring will pass inspection.
(1970 Code, § 13-304)
19-105. Underground power lines.

to care for same, the cost of the necessary repairs or replacements shall be
paid by the customer.
(1970 Code, § 13-306)
19-107. Right of access.
   The electric department's identified employees shall have access to the

testing, repairing, removing, or exchanging any or all equipment belonging to
the electric department. Installed meter bases shall be located in such a
manner that the electric department has complete accessibility to the meters at
all times. If a meter is inaccessible for reading, the usage will be estimated.
A $10.00 service charge will be added to the customer's bill if a second trip
is required, due to prior inaccessibility, to read or test a meter. All plans
to modify the premises and/or structures thereon shall contain provisions to
relocate the meter base, if necessary, in order to preserve the accessibility.
If, in the event relocation of the meter base is not feasible, a remote
metering circuit may be installed at the discretion of the electric department.

the provisions of the schedule of rates and charges, or of the application of
the customer or contract with the customer. The electric department may
discontinue service to the customer for the theft of current or the appearance
of current theft devices on the premises of the customer. The discontinuance of
service by the electric department for any causes as stated in this rule does
not release the customer from his obligation to the electric department for the
payment of minimum bills as specified in the application of the customer or the
contract with the customer.
(1970 Code, § 13-309)
19-110. Termination of contract by customer.

   The electric department will use reasonable diligence in supplying current,
but shall not be liable for breach of contract in the event of, or for loss,
injury, or damage to persons or property resulting from, interruptions in
service, excessive or inadequate voltage, single-phasing, or otherwise
unsatisfactory service, whether or not caused by negligence.
(1970 Code, § 13-313)
19-113. Voltage fluctuations caused by the customer.
   Electric service must not be used in such a manner as to cause unusual

department may require the customer, at his own expense, to install suitable
apparatus which will reasonably limit such fluctuations.
(1970 Code, § 13-314)
19-114. Additional load.
   The service connection, transformers, meters, and equipment supplied by the
electric department for each customer have a definite capacity, and no addition
to the equipment or load connected thereto will be allowed except by consent of

meet his peculiar requirements for service at other than standard voltages, or
for the supply of closer voltage regulation than required by standard practice.
(1970 Code, § 13-318)
19-118. Meter tests and reading checks.
   The electric department will, at its own expense, make periodic tests and
inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy. The
electric department will make additional tests or inspections of its meters at
the request of the customer.
   If tests made at the customer's request show that the meter is accurate
within two percent (2%), slow or fast, no adjustment will be made in the
customer's bill, and the testing charge of ten dollars ($10.00) per meter will
be paid by the customer. If the test shows the meter to be in excess of two
percent (2%) fast or slow, an adjustment shall be made in the customer's bill
for a period of not over thirty (30) days prior to the date of such test, and
the cost of making the test shall be borne by the electric department. A ten
dollar ($10.00) charge will be made when a trip to re-read a meter is made at

19-120. Billing adjusted to standard periods.
   The demand charges and the blocks in the energy charges set forth in the
rate schedules are based on billing periods of approximately one (l) month. In
the case of the first billing of new accounts (temporary service, cotton gins,
and other seasonal customers excepted) where the period covered by the billing
involves fractions of a month, the demand charges and the blocks of the energy
charge will be adjusted to a basis proportionate with the period of time during
which service is extended.
(1970 Code, § 13-321)
19-121. Tampering with electric department's property.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to tamper with, or interfere with, the
operation of any electric meter through which electricity is supplied by the
City of Cookeville, Tennessee, or to in any way tamper with or interfere with
any of the electric facilities of the city or to make improper connections
thereto so as to evade, or attempt to evade, the payment of lawful service and

city shall be presumed to have done so with the intent to evade or attempt to
evade the payment of lawful service and connection charges to the city.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, individual, or group of

kilowatt hours. A utility bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposit
equal to two (2) months bill will be required for all new commercial and
industrial accounts whose monthly usage is anticipated to exceed five thousand
(5,000) kilowatt hours. The guarantee amount will not exceed twice the highest
monthly bill. The electric security amount will be determined by the amount of
kW demand requested by the customer in CED's power contract and/or the kWh
loading information supplied by the customer. If billing information is
available at the given location, previous history may be used to determine the
guarantee amount. When a cash deposit is paid in full, interest will be paid on
an annual basis. Interest will be credited to customer deposit balance in
January of each calendar year based on the previous calendar year average
annual interest rate earned on the primary deposit account less bank fees.
Customers may review deposit balance including interest credit. Additional
information can be found in Customer Service Policy 3.2. Each separate meter
shall require an appropriate guarantee regardless of the number of meters
provided for a single customer or single premise. Existing commercial/
industrial accounts that are scheduled for non-pay cut-off two or more times in
a twelve month period shall be required to provide security as stated above. If
a bond or letter of credit expires or is cancelled, the service will be
terminated. A power contract shall be required for commercial and industrial
customers whose electric service is greater than 300 kW. The power contract
referred to herein shall be in conformity with the requirements of the power
contract between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the City of Cookeville,
Tennessee. The electric department shall draft such contracts as the
requirements of each customer's situation requires and deliver the same to the
new customer and to the existing customers whose level of demand for service
changed so as to require a new contract. The contract shall be tendered to the
customer for execution. If the customer fails to enter into said contract, such
failure shall constitute a delinquency in that account.

employees shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to enter upon the
customers premises at all reasonable and/or necessary times and inspect gas
appliances, installations and piping to determine whether or not the same meets
the requirements of the rules and regulations of Cookeville, Tennessee, at such
time. The gas department reserves the right to refuse or terminate gas service
for violation of the above mentioned rules and regulations or for any other
condition deemed hazardous by responsible gas department representatives or
employees. The inspection provided for in this section shall not, however,
render the gas department liable or responsible for any loss or damage
resulting from defects in installation, piping, or appliances, or resulting
from violation of the rules and regulations of Cookeville, Tennessee, or from
accidents which may occur upon customer's premises.
(1970 Code, § 13-212)
19-210. Right of access.
   The gas department's identified employees shall have access to each
customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters
and testing, repairing, removing, or exchanging any or all equipment belonging
to the gas department.
(1970 Code, § 13-213)
19-211. Customers' responsibility for gas department property.
   All meters, regulators, service connections, and other equipment furnished
by the gas department shall be and remain the property of the gas department.
   Each customer shall provide a place for, and exercise proper care to protect
the property of the gas department on its premises. In the event of loss or
damage to the gas department property arising from the neglect of a customer to
care for same, the cost of necessary repairs or replacement shall be paid by
the customer.
(1970 Code, § 13-214)
19-212. Issuance of bills, disconnect of service for unpaid balance.
   (1)   Issuance of bills. The City of Cookeville shall issue utility bills in
accordance with the City of Cookeville Customer Service Polices approved by the

   (2)   Disconnect of service for unpaid balance. The City of Cookeville shall
disconnect utility accounts for an unpaid or past due balance in accordance
with the City of Cookeville Customer Service Polices approved by the city

(1970 Code, § 13-215, as replaced by Ord. #004-10-19, Oct. 2004)
19-213. Discontinuance of service.
   The Cookeville Gas Department will refuse to connect or will disconnect gas
service for any violation of this chapter, or for violation of any of the
provisions of pertinent rules and regulations established for the guidance and
operation of the Cookeville Gas Department. The discontinuance of service by
the gas department for any cause as stated in this section does not release the
customer from his obligation to the gas department for the payment of minimum
bills as specified in the application of the customer or the contract with the
customer.
(1970 Code, § 13-216)
19-214. Termination of service by customer.
   Customers who have fulfilled their contract terms and wish to discontinue
service must give at least three (3) days' written notice to that effect,
unless their service contract specifies otherwise. Notice to discontinue
service prior to expiration of the contract term will not relieve the customer
from any minimum or guaranteed payment under any contract or rate.
(1970 Code, § 13-217)
19-215. Interruption of service.
   The gas department will use reasonable diligence to provide a regular and
uninterrupted supply of gas, but the gas department cannot and does not
guarantee the consumer any fixed pressure or continuous service. In case the
supply of gas shall be interrupted or disturbed for any cause, the gas
department shall not be liable for damages resulting therefrom.
   In connection with the operation, maintenance, repair and extension of the
gas distribution system, the gas supply may be shut off without notice, when
necessary or desirable; and each customer must be prepared for such
emergencies. The gas department shall not be held liable for any damages from
such interruption of service or for damages from the resumption of service
without notice after any such interruption.
(1970 Code, § 13-218)
19-216. Additional load.
   The service line, regulator, meter, and equipment supplied by the gas
department for each customer have definite capacities, and no additional load
shall be connected thereto except by consent of the gas department. Failure to
give notice of additions or changes in load, and to obtain the gas department's
consent for same, shall render the customer liable for any damage to any of the
gas department's equipment caused by such additional or changed installation.
(1970 Code, § 13-219)
19-217. Notice of trouble.
   Customers shall notify the gas department immediately should the service be
unsatisfactory for any reason, or should there be any defects, trouble, or
accidents affecting the supply of gas. Such notices, if verbal, shall be
confirmed in writing at the earliest reasonable time.
(1970 Code, § 13-220)
19-218. Meter tests.
   The gas department will, at its own expense, make periodical tests and
inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy of
said meters. The gas department will make additional tests or inspections of
its meters at the request of the customer. If tests made at a customer's
request show that the meter is accurate within two percent (2%), either slow or
fast, no adjustment will be made in the customer's bill, and the testing charge
of one dollar ($1.00) per meter will be paid by the customer, said amount to be
included in the next bill sent to the customer by the gas department. In case
the test shows the meter to be in excess of two percent (2%), either slow or
fast, an adjustment shall be made in the customer's bill over a period of not
to exceed thirty (30) days prior to the date of such test, and cost of making
the test shall be borne by the gas department.
(1970 Code, § 13-221)
19-219. Restricted use of gas.
   In times of emergencies or in times of gas shortage, the gas department
reserves the right to restrict the purposes for which gas may be used by a
customer and the amount of gas which a customer may use.
   A time of gas shortage within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to
exist whenever the actual use or the reasonably anticipated use of gas in any
day, or any other fixed period of time exceeds the quantity of gas the gas
department is entitled to obtain and can obtain from the gas department's
supplier without incurring any overrun penalties or charges in excess of the
price normally paid for natural gas.
   (1)   Insofar as is reasonably practical, the following priorities shall be
observed when the gas department finds it necessary or desirable to restrict
the use of gas as authorized by this section, with the highest priority of use
being the first named and the subsequent uses being in descending order or
priority.
      (a)   Residential customers.
      (b)   Small commercial customers (less than 50 MCF on a peak day).
      (c)   Large firm commercial customers (50 MCF or more on a peak day) and
firm industrial customers.
      (d)   Interruptible customers.
   Interruptions or curtailments may be on a day to day basis or customers may
be restricted on the amount of gas they are allowed to use in a stated period
of from one (1) to twelve (12) calendar months.
   (2)   Nothing contained herein shall prevent the gas department from varying
the priorities as stated above or varying the degree of curtailment when such
variance is necessary to prevent interference with essential public services
including the operation of hospitals, schools, educational institutions,
utility services, and governmental operations, or whenever the gas department
in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, determine such variance to be
necessary where:
      (a)   The use of an alternate fuel would impose unacceptable safety
hazards or is otherwise not technically feasible.
      (b)   Natural gas is used as raw material for its chemical properties in
creating an end product.
      (c)   Applications requiring precise temperature controls and precise
flame characteristics where the flame is in direct contact with the material
being processed and alternate fuels are not technically feasible.
      (d)   Abnormal circumstances, such as strikes, plant closings, etc.,
during the "base period" being used as a basis for curtailment resulting in
lower "base period" volumes than the annual usage normally would have been
during the base period.
   To insure that any variances granted shall be uniform and nondiscriminatory
in nature, an advisory committee composed of industry representatives and/or
other technically qualified persons shall be formed to study any request for
variance from any curtailment which may be imposed under the terms of this
section. Recommendations from this committee shall be given due consideration
but shall not be binding upon the gas department in determining whether or not
a variance is to be granted. Any variance granted or refused by the gas
department may be appealed to the city council.
   The gas department shall establish written procedures for the implementation
of any curtailment resulting from the inability to obtain sufficient gas
supplies for the requirements of its customers. Customers likely to be
curtailed will be notified as far in advance as practicable and shall be given
information on their priority classification, a copy of the sections of the
municipal code pertaining to the gas curtailment, and the written procedures
developed by the gas department for implementing the curtailment.
   Whenever a customer takes gas in excess of the amount allowed under any
notice from the gas department restricting or interrupting the customer's use
of gas, the customer shall be required to pay to the gas department for any
penalties or other excess charges incurred by the gas department including, but
not limited to, propane, liquified natural gas furnished by the department's
supplier and/or through its own facilities, or other gaseous products. In
addition, should said excess use of gas cause the department to incur damages
#93116, September 1993. Section IV of Ord. #93116, states "It is further
ordained that this ordinance shall become effective with all bills for gas
service rendered after September 25, 1993, the public welfare requiring it." or
other liabilities from its other customers, the customer shall be required to
discharge same and hold the department harmless therefor. Refusal to pay such
charges, penalties, or damages or continued or willful overruns shall be
sufficient grounds for cancellation of service to such customer, as well as
legal proceedings to collect such charges, penalties or damages.
   A customer's maximum day may be determined by recording devices, actual day
by day readings, or calculated from the previous twelve months maximum
consumption. For heating customers, this calculation shall be based on 5% of
the maximum months consumption. For customers whose usage is practically
constant regardless of weather conditions, the calculation shall be the maximum
months consumption divided by the number of days normally worked in a month.
The method used shall be the method determined by the gas department to be the
most practical.
(1970 Code, § 13-222)
19-220. Billing adjusted to standard periods.
   The gas charges as set forth in the rate schedules are based on billing
periods of approximately one (1) month. In case of the first billing of new
accounts and final billing of all accounts where the period covered by the
billing involves fractions of a month, the charges will be adjusted to a basis
proportionate with the period of time during which service is extended.
(1970 Code, § 13-223)

   RATE SCHEDULE G-5
   INTERRUPTIBLE GAS SERVICE
   AVAILABILITY
   Effective May 14, 2020 - Service under Rate Schedule G-5, which includes
Rate 690, is available to those customers who have been approved by the
Cookeville Gas Department and who meet the following requirements and have
signed a written contract with the Cookeville Gas Department specifying these
requirements:
      (a)   Have an annual usage, on an actual or projected basis, of not less
than 1,500 Ccf per day or 500,000 Ccf annually.
      (b)   Have alternate fuel capability for use during periods of
curtailment or total interruption.
      (c)   Agree to cease or curtail the use of natural gas in accordance with
written or verbal instructions from the Cookeville Gas Department.
   CHARACTER OF SERVICE
   Interruptible gas shall be available only to the extent that the Cookeville
Gas Department has gas available within it's maximum daily contract quantity
that is not required by its firm customers or when the Cookeville Gas
Department is able to obtain additional gas supply and the gas transmission
companies serving Cookeville have interruptible transportation available.
   Gas purchased under Rate Schedule G-5 shall be used only by the customer at
its facilities and shall be delivered to a single point of delivery located
within the service area of the Cookeville Gas Distribution System and shall not
be resold by the customer.
   NET RATE
   Effective May 14, 2020 - The net rate for service under Rate Schedule G-
5 for each monthly billing period shall be the sum of the commodity charge, the

   Transportation and overhead charge: 09.70 cents per Ccf. plus;
   Commodity charge: The actual cost of gas purchased by the Cookeville Gas
Department, less any demand charges, but including gas cost, transportation
cost, and any additional charges imposed by the transmission pipelines serving
Cookeville. This includes gas purchased by Cookeville under its firm supply and
transportation contracts as well as any gas purchased under interruptible
supply and transportation contracts. The commodity charge shall be calculated
and billed on a monthly basis.
   Unauthorized overrun charge: Those actual charges which the Cookeville Gas
Department, incur in supplying the additional gas used by the customer above
the amount authorized.
   PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT
   Since the commodity charge and unauthorized overrun charge varies monthly
based on the actual cost of gas and transportation, the purchased gas
adjustment does not apply to this rate schedule.

accordance with the City of Cookeville Customer Service Policies approved by
the city manager and in effect at the time of the issuance of the utility bill.
   UNAUTHORIZED OVERRUN PENALTY

shall be charged, in addition to the transportation and overhead charge, the
cost to the Cookeville Gas Department in supplying the unauthorized gas,
including, but not limited to, any charges by the transmission pipelines or gas
supplier for the cost of natural gas, transportation and penalties, liquified
natural gas, and propane-air. In addition to these costs, the Cookeville Gas
Department may pursue any other remedy available to it under applicable law,
including, but not limited to, suspension or termination of service. The
existence of a penalty shall not be construed to give any customer the right to
take unauthorized gas.
   PRIORITY OF SERVICE
   Interruptible gas service is supplied to customers of the Cookeville Gas
Department under Rate Schedule G-5. Customers who purchase gas under firm rate
schedules shall have priority over customers purchasing gas under Rate Schedule
G-5. Except as may otherwise be determined by the Cookeville Gas Department in
its sole discretion, periods of curtailment or interruption shall generally be
imposed on G-5 customers for the following reasons:
   (1)   Whenever the Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) of natural gas available to
the Cookeville Gas Department under Rate Schedules FT-A, FS and FT on any given
day is insufficient to meet the projected requirements of the firm rate
customers and interruptible rate customers, The customers purchasing gas on
firm rate schedules shall have first priority on the available gas supply and
interruptible customers shall be notified to curtail their use of natural gas.
The curtailment may be a partial or total curtailment. The customer shall be
advised of the amount of gas, if any, they may be allowed to use during each 24
hour period. The curtailment shall extend until notified by the Gas Department
that normal gas usage may resume or the time specified in the notice of
curtailment has expired.
   (2) During periods of curtailment, the Cookeville Gas Department shall
endeavor to obtain additional gas supply and transportation service under
Interruptible (IT) Rate Schedules. If such supply is available, the G-
5 customers may utilize this supply to the extent available to reduce or
eliminate the need for curtailment.
   (3) When curtailment becomes necessary for G-5 Service, order of curtailment
shall be in accordance with the customers load factor. The first service
interrupted shall be those customers whose load factor falls below thirty-three
percent (33%). The next customers interrupted shall be those customers with
load factors between thirty-three percent (33%) and sixty-six percent (66%).
Last curtailed shall be customers with load factors over sixty-six percent
(66%). Customers falling within the same load factor group shall be curtailed
on a prorata or other equitable basis.
   NOTICES
To the extent possible, the Cookeville Gas Department shall give customers as
much advance notice of curtailment as possible, usually the day before, and
except in extreme emergencies, at least one hour before a period of curtailment
begins. A notice of curtailment may be written or oral and shall be sufficient
if given by the Cookeville Gas Department via telephone or in person to the
person or persons designated from time to time by the customer as authorized to
receive such notices, or by facsimile transmission to the telephone number
designated from time to time by, the customer, or if mailed or hand-delivered
in writing to the customer's premises. If a period of curtailment involves only
a reduction in the amount of gas a customer may use, the notice shall state the
daily quantity of gas which the customer may use. A period of curtailment shall
continue in effect until the Cookeville Gas Department notifies the customer
that the period of curtailment has terminated or until the time specified in
the notice of curtailment has expired. A day is defined as a period of time
beginning at 9:00 A.M. and ending at 9:00 A.M. the following morning local
time.
   MINIMUM BILL
   The minimum bill under Rate Schedule G-5 is $120.00.
   RULES AND REGULATIONS
   All service provided hereunder is subject to the rules and regulations of
the Cookeville Gas Department which may from time to time be in effect.
   RATE SCHEDULE G-7
   OUTSIDE CITY GAS SERVICE
   AVAILABILITY
   Service under Rate Schedule G-7 is available to all customers in all classes
who are located outside the city limits of the City of Cookeville. All terms
and conditions of the preceding rate schedules will apply to these customers
with the exception of the net commodity charge which will be twentyfive percent
(25%) higher than the corresponding net commodity charge for customers located
within the city limits of the City of Cookeville. (1970 Code, § 13- 224, as
amended by Ord. #000-07-25, July 2000; Ord. #002-06-016, June 2002; Ord. #003-

Notes
  1   The provisions of §§ 19-220, 19-221, and 19-222 are taken from Ord.
1 #93116, September 1993. Section IV of Ord. #93116, states "It is further
  ordained that this ordinance shall become effective with all bills for gas
  service rendered after September 25, 1993, the public welfare requiring it."
19-222. Purchased gas adjustment.1
1   The provisions of §§ 19-220, 19-221, and 19-222 are taken from Ord. #93116,
September 1993. Section IV of Ord. #93116, states "It is further ordained that
this ordinance shall become effective with all bills for gas service rendered
after September 25, 1993, the public welfare requiring it."
   The rate schedules, except Rate Schedule G-5, of the Cookeville Gas
Department shall be adjusted as follows:
   (1)   Provision for adjustment. The base retail gas rates per one hundred
cubic feet (Ccf) of gas set forth in Rate Schedules G-2, G-3, G-4, and G-7 of
the Cookeville Gas Department shall be increased or decreased by an amount
hereinafter described, which amount shall be called the "purchased gas
adjustment" or the "PGA".
   (2)   Intent and application to various purchases. (a) This purchased gas
adjustment is intended to allow recovery on an equitable basis of the total
cost of gas purchased, transported, and/or reserved for delivery to the gas
sales customers of the Cookeville Gas Department.
      (b)   The PGA anticipates various sources and costs of purchased gas for
general system supply including, but not limited to:
         (i)   Cost of natural gas purchased from producers, brokers,
interstate pipeline or transmission companies, intrastate pipeline or
transmission companies, marketers, joint ventures, other distribution
companies, and end-users whether or not regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
         (ii)   Cost of liquified natural gas (LNG) and vaporized LNG.
         (iii)   Cost of liquefied petroleum gas/air mixture (PA).
         (iv)   Cost of substitute natural gas (SNG)
         (v)   Cost of other hydrocarbons used as feedstock for production of
substitute natural gas.
         (vi)   Cost of contractual storage and transportation of items (i)
through (v) above.
   ANNUAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF GAS (AWACOG)
   The annual weighted average cost of gas shall be computed on the date this
amendment becomes effective. This computation shall be used to determine the
base retail gas rates. This computation shall be based on all the cost
associated with obtaining gas supply, including but not limited to, the cost of
gas, demand charges, commodity charges, transportation charges, LNG costs, PA
costs, nominating and balancing charges, Order 636 charges, storage costs
including: reservation fees, storage injection and withdrawal charges,
transition costs, and any other similar charges from any marketer or pipeline
transporter.
   In order to establish the base retail gas rates, the gas revenues for the
twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the effective date of this
amendment shall be divided by the Ccf's of gas sold during that period to
determine the average revenue per Ccf of gas sold. Operation and maintenance
costs, including depreciation, in-lieu-of-tax payments, principal payments,
interest expense and any other costs, e.g., normal capital expenditures,
normally involved in operating the Cookeville Gas Distribution System shall be
added to the computed AWACOG in order to establish the revenue per Ccf required
in order to operate the system. The difference between the revenue required and
the actual revenue per Ccf for the preceding twelve (12) month period shall be
added to each step of Rate Schedules G-2, G-3 and G-4 in order to establish the
initial base retail gas rates.
   The AWACOG shall be computed monthly. The PGA shall first be triggered when
the AWACOG increases or decreases by as much as one-half cent per Ccf compared
to the then existing PGA. The increase or decrease shall be reflected on all
bills rendered after the 30th day of the month in which the PGA has been
triggered. Monthly AWACOG increases or decreases of less than one-half cent per
Ccf shall accumulate until the aggregate of the increases or decreases has
reached or exceeded one-half cent per Ccf since the last PGA. The PGA shall
only apply to increases or decreases in the annual weighted average cost of gas
and not to increases in the cost of operating and maintaining the gas system.
(1970 Code, § 13-225, modified)

system or whether in some way the alarm system malfunctioned and thereby
activated a false alarm.
   (2)   If the police officer at the scene of the activated alarm system
determines the alarm to be false, said officer shall make a report of the false
alarm, a notification of which shall be mailed or delivered to the alarm user,

be made within ten days from the receipt of the above findings by the chief of
police.
   (6)   Until all of the steps set forth in this section have been completed,
the false alarm in question will be considered to have been genuine and will
not be considered the basis for the prima facie presumption that the involved
alarm system is malfunctioning, except as to any proceedings that may be
instituted in the city court for a violation of this chapter.
   (7)   The imposition of fees, actions and procedures for enforcement and
regulation herein are declared to be cumulative and in addition to such court
procedures as may be herein created or previously existing. Nothing in this
section or in any other provisions of this chapter shall alter, control or
modify the jurisdiction and procedure of the city court in those cases where

service charge per false alarm occurrence after the third such false alarm in
any fiscal year. Each service charge incurred shall be billed and payment shall
be made within thirty days from the date of receipt thereof. Failure to make
payments within thirty days from the date of receipt shall result in a
discontinuance of police response to alarms that may occur at the premises
described in the alarm user's permit until payment is received.
   Failure to make payment within sixty days of receipt of the bill shall
result in the user's permit being deemed to thereby be revoked.
   (2)   Any permit revoked shall not be reinstated until all outstanding false
alarm service charges are paid in full together with a twelve dollar ($12.00)
reinstatement fee. There shall be no refund of any unused portion of a permit
fee.

provided herein;

SECTION 201 201-4
SECTION 201.8 NONCONFORMITIES
The purpose of this Section is to establish regulations and limitations on the continued existence
of uses, lots, and structures established prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code which do
not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
Any nonconforming lot, structure, or use of land or structure which existed lawfully at the time of
the enactment of this Zoning Code and which remains nonconforming and any lot, structure, use,
or use of structure which shall become nonconforming upon enactment of this Zoning Code or any
subsequent amendments thereto may be continued subject to the provisions of this Section.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully
begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which
actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined
to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
201.8A NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
1. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, not withstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a single-family dwelling
and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record as of the
enactment of this Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of area, width, and
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
2. If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
Zoning Code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width
and area established by this Zoning Code, the lands involved shall be considered to be
an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Code, and no portion of said
parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements
established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which
leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
Zoning Code.

Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually
Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the city council finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a
wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and
property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public
indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on
surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
2. Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to
minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be
separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects
associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually
oriented businesses in one area.
3. Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City
has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial
government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is part of the City’s
rationale for this Code, exists independent of any comparative analysis between
sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the City’s
interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future

secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may
locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this

The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record
related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the
judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

208.6D DESCRIPTION OF SCREENS AND BUFFER YARDS BY TYPE
(As amended by Ordinance No. O07-06-13)
1. Type 1 Screen/Buffer Yard
A Type 1 Screen/Buffer Yard is intended to create the impression of a separation of
spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the uses. The buffer
yard shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width. The screening shall consist of
intermittent visual obstruction to a height of at least ten (10) feet. Screening may be
composed of a wall, solid fence (wood, brick, or masonry), landscaped earth berm,
planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens
or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and
density of foliage of the subject species, or field observations of existing vegetation.
The screen may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting standards that will
achieve the requirements for Type 1 Screen/Buffer Yard are depicted on Illustration
19 in Section 235 of this Zoning Code. The adequacy of the required screening shall
be determined from the elevation of the adjacent residential property or property of
a lower classification. A greater height, more opaque screening, or wider buffer
yard may be required by the Building Official if it is determined that, due
topographic reasons or scale of development, the screening will not adequately
block visual contact or create the impression of separation between uses.
2. Type 2 Screen/Buffer Yard
A Type 2 Screen/Buffer Yard is intended to partially block visual contact between
uses and to create an impression of the separation of spaces. The buffer yard shall be
a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width. The screening shall be completely opaque
from the ground to height of three (3) feet, with intermittent visual obstruction above
the opaque portion to a height of at least ten (10) feet. Screening may be composed
of a wall, solid fence (wood, brick, or masonry), landscaped earth berm, planted
vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or
natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and
density of foliage of the subject species, or field observations of existing vegetation.
The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year.
Deciduous plants may be used to meet the intermittent screening portion of the semiopaque
screen. Suggested planting standards that will achieve the requirements for
Type 2 Screen/Buffer Yard are depicted on Illustration 20 in Section 235 of this
Zoning Code. The adequacy of the required screening shall be determined from the
elevation of the adjacent residential property or property of a lower classification.
A greater height, more opaque screening, or wider buffer yard may be required by
the Building Official if it is determined that, due topographic reasons or scale of
development, the screening will not adequately block visual contact or create the
impression of separation between uses.

SECTION 208 208-11
3. Type 3 Screen/Buffer Yard
A Type 3 Screen/Buffer Yard is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses.
The buffer yard shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width. The screening shall
be completely opaque from the ground to a height of at least eight (8) feet.
Screening may be composed of a wall, solid fence (wood, brick, or masonry),
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of
planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observations of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque
in all seasons of the year. Suggested planting standards that will achieve the
requirements for Type 3 Screen/Buffer Yard are depicted on Illustration 21 in Section
235 of this Zoning Code. The adequacy of the required screening shall be
determined from the elevation of the adjacent residential property or property of a
lower classification. A greater height, more opaque screening, or wider buffer yard
may be required by the Building Official if it is determined that, due topographic
reasons or scale of development, the screening will not adequately block visual
contact or create the impression of separation between uses.
208.6E STANDARDS FOR SCREENING MATERIALS
1. When earthen berms are utilized in screening they shall meet the following
requirements:
a. Shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet
b. Shall have a minimum crown width of two (2) feet

feet on an individual street is not necessary to meet the minimum lot size
requirements for the new construction or expansion.

of Public Works.

Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title
44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Ch. 1, Section 60.3.
230.3B Areas of Cookeville are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
230.3C Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing
increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are
vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
SECTION 230.4 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Section is
designed to:
230.4A Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
230.4B Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

230.9C Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard with Established Base Flood Elevations
and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 230.7B, are
areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must
remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood
without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions
shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction,
substantial improvements or other developments within the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in ANY increase in the water surface elevation of the
Base Flood Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of a
base flood discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the same
methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City of Cookeville,
Tennessee and certification, thereof.
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 230.9A
and 230.9B.
230.9D Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established Base Flood
Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 230.7B, where
streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial
improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to
standard hydraulic engineering principles.
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 230.9A
and 230.9B.
FL
COOKEVILLE ZONING CODE

230.9E Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations or Floodways (A
Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 230.7B, where
streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where a Floodway has not
been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base Flood
Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or other sources,
including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria
for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Sections 230.9A and 230.9B.
2. Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than
50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood
Elevation data.

established and where such data is not available from other sources, require the
lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least three
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Section 230.6). All
applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be
recorded as set forth in Section 230.8B. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in
accordance with the standards of Section 230.9B.
4. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area
equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is greater, measured
from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more
than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Cookeville, Tennessee. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to
standard hydraulic engineering principles.
5. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 230.9A
and 230.9B. Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections of Section
230.9B dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, assuring
watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured homes provisions
are complied with as required.
230.9F Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 230.7B, are areas
designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in
Section 230.9A and 230.9B, apply:
FL
COOKEVILLE ZONING CODE
SECTION 230 230-18

buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at
least one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM’s,
in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on
the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be
provided in accordance with standards of Section 230.9B.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings
may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be
completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number
specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three (3) feet
above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered professional engineer or

Located within the areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 230.7B are
areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where Base
Flood Elevations have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all
provisions of Section 230.8 and Section 230.9 shall apply.
230.9H Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within Cookeville, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special
flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the
following provisions shall apply:
1. No encroachments including fill material or other development including structures
shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream,
measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality.
2. When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and floodway data is
available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the standards
established in accordance with Sections 230.8 and 230.9.

buildings in the same district.

reasonable use of the land, building, or structure;
VIII. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the

At all street corners, there shall be
an obstruction free area in which
no object between the height of 2 ft.
and 10 ft. is permitted if such object
will limit visibility at the intersection.
The obstruction free area is defined
by extending the edges of pavement
of the intersecting streets, ignoring
any radius, to a point. From this point,
two other points are established by
measuring 50 ft. along the edge of
pavement of each street. These two
points are then joined to establish the
limits of the obstruction free area.

GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBDIVISION
Throughout the following process, the owner/developer is strongly encouraged to
personally participate in consultations and meetings regarding the development.
1. Attend pre-development conference with the Department of Planning to become
thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, the Major Street Plan and
other public improvements which might affect the area to be subdivided.
2. Have preliminary sketch plat prepared by a reputable state-licensed surveyor.
3. Discuss Preliminary Plat with the Director of Planning. This pre application review
by a trained land planner may save the developer time and costly revisions as
well as possible savings through better design.
4. If the development will use individual septic tanks, submit plat to Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation, which may place restrictions on
number, size, and use of lots. The timing of approval by the City of Cookeville
Municipal Planning Commission is dependent on the Department of Environment
and Conservation results.
5. Contact applicable departments/agencies for street and utility specifications.
Obtain Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation approval of
water and sewer plans and submit signed plans to the Planning Department.
6. Submit Preliminary Plat to the Planning Department. Submit required
Preliminary Plat review and construction inspection fees. The Planning
Department will then route the Preliminary Plat to the applicable
departments/agencies for review. If any changes to the Preliminary Plat are
required by the applicable departments/agencies the Planning Department will
notify the developer so that the changes can be made prior to the submission of
the Preliminary Plat to the Planning Commission for approval.
7. After Preliminary Plat approval has been granted, the developer and his
contractor must attend a pre-construction meeting with the applicable reviewing
agencies to review the required standards and procedures for the installation of
improvements. The developer may then proceed to install all required
improvements in the subdivision according to preliminary plat and the required
modifications, if any.
8. Prepare and submit Final Plat to the Planning Department for approval by the
Planning Commission. Submit final as-built plans, Final Plat review fee and
Warranty of Improvements. Submit Financial Guarantees, if any.
9. Upon Final Plat approval the Planning Department will route the plat for signature
of the plat certificates by the appropriate street and utility officials certifying that
the improvements have been made (or that a financial guarantee has been
established). The Planning Commission Secretary will sign the certificate of
approval for recording when all other certificates have been signed and will
record the plat with the Putnam County Register of Deeds' office. The developer
may then proceed with the sale of the lots.
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
of
The City of Cookeville Municipal Planning Commission
City of Cookeville, Tennessee
ARTICLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once
land has been cut up into streets, lots, and blocks and publicly recorded, the
correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later
becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained
and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The
welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It
is therefore in the interest of the public, the developer, and the future owners that
subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound
rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the City of Cookeville, Tennessee,
Municipal Planning Commission (hereafter referred to as the Planning
Commission) are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the
municipal area; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic,
light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer, and other sanitary
facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority granted by
Section 13-4-301 through Section 13-4-309 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.
The Planning Commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these
statutes as a prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations, having filed on
April 20, 2000 a certified copy of the Major Street Plan in Cabinet C, Slide 190 in
the office of the Register of Deeds of Putnam County, Tennessee.
C. Jurisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits
of Cookeville, Tennessee as now or hereafter established.
Any owner of land within the City of Cookeville wishing to subdivide land shall
submit to the Planning Commission a plat of the subdivision according to the
procedures outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform to the minimum
requirements set forth in Article III. Improvements shall be installed as required
by Articles V through XII.

Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
E. Variances
1. General: Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary
hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with
these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served
to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to
these Subdivision Regulations so that substantial justice may be done and
the public interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further
provided the Planning Commission shall not approve variances unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
a. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
b. The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;
c. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from
a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are
carried out;
d. The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Zoning Code. Variances from the provisions of the Zoning Code
must be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. Conditions: In approving variances, the Planning Commission may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3. Procedures: A petition for any variance should be submitted in writing by
the developer at the time the preliminary plat is filed for consideration by
the Planning Commission. Said petition shall state fully the grounds for
the application. Each request for a variance shall be specifically applied
for in the numerical order of the subdivision regulations.
F. Relationship to Zoning Code and other Regulations
1. No final plat of land within the force and effect of the Cookeville Zoning
Code shall be approved unless it conforms to such code.
2. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or
dimensions noted herein and those contained in the zoning code, building
code, or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.
9
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
G. Compliance with Deed Restrictions and Covenants

restrictions or covenants prohibit the subdivision or resubdivision of the property.
H. Separability
Should any section, subsection, paragraph or provision of these regulations be
held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision
shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision of these regulations, it
being the intention of the Cookeville Municipal Planning Commission to adopt
each and every provision of these regulations separately.
I. Repeal of Previous Regulations
All subdivision regulations previously adopted by the Cookeville Municipal
Planning Commission are hereby repealed as of the adoption and effective date
of these regulations.

(4) basic steps (with the exception of Minor and Two-Lot Subdivisions). (1) The initial
step is the pre-development conference with the Planning Department for advice and
assistance. (2) The second step is the preparation and submission to the Planning
Commission of a Preliminary Plat of the proposed subdivision. (3) The third step is to
construct or install improvements such as streets, fire hydrants and utility lines. (4) The
fourth step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a Final
Plat, together with required certificates. This Final Plat becomes the instrument to be
recorded in the office of the Putnam County Register of Deeds when duly signed by the
Secretary of the Planning Commission.
A. General
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission who wishes to divide land into two (2) or more lots, sites, or
other divisions requiring any new street or utility construction, or any
division of less than five (5) acres for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of sale or building development, or who wishes to resubdivide an
existing subdivision lot(s) for this purpose, shall submit a plan of such
proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission for approval and shall
obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record and
prior to selling or giving a deed for any lot.
Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of
design for the subdivision of land as set forth in Article III of these
regulations and shall be presented in the manner specified in the following
sections of this Article. No plat of a subdivision of land within the area of
planning jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded by the Register of Deeds
without the approval of the Planning Commission as specified herein.
2. The owner or his authorized representative must be present at preliminary
plat review and approval and final plat review and approval. In his
absence, the property owner may be represented by his agent or
representative who shall present written authorization.
3. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or
accepted for record by the Putnam County Register of Deeds until the
required improvements listed shall be constructed in a satisfactory manner
and approved by the local approving agent. In lieu of such prior
construction, the Planning Commission may accept certain forms of
financial guarantees (See Section H of this Article) in amounts equal to the
estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, whereby
improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to the City
of Cookeville in the event of default by the developer.
B. Pre-Development Conference
In order to secure review and approval by the Planning Commission of a
proposed subdivision, the prospective developer shall, prior to the making of any
street improvements or installations of utilities, meet informally with the Planning
Department for a pre-development conference.
11
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
C. Filing Fees
At the time of the submittal of a preliminary plat for review, or final plat if a
preliminary plat is not required, a nonrefundable filing fee based on the following
fee schedule shall be paid to the City of Cookeville. Said fees shall be used to
help defray the costs of plat review and inspections.
Fee Schedule
Preliminary Plat $200.00
Subdivision Inspection $200.00
Final Plat $100.00
Minor Plat $100.00
2-Lot Plat $65.00
Extension of Preliminary Plat Approval $50.00
D. Procedure for Preliminary Plat Review
The following procedure shall apply for the review of all Preliminary Plats:
1. Filing Deadline
The deadline for inclusion on the agenda shall be 12 Noon on the first
Monday of the months that the Planning Commission meets. The
developer shall submit to the Cookeville Planning Department one (1)
reproducible copy of any required preliminary plat of a proposed
subdivision. The Planning Department will distribute copies of the plat to
all city utilities and departments (water, sewer, fire, street, electric, or gas,
as necessary). The developer shall provide copies, if necessary, to the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Upper
Cumberland Electric Membership Cooperative, the Middle Tennessee
Natural Gas Utility District, and the applicable telephone and cable
television systems.
2. The Planning Department shall review the preliminary plat for
conformance with the specifications and standards of these regulations.
Plats failing to meet these requirements will be returned to the developer
or his agent for correction. Upon receipt of the corrected plat, the
Secretary will place the item on the agenda. Said corrected plat shall be
submitted within seven (7) days after it has been returned for correction.
3. All preliminary plats shall be placed on the “study agenda” prior to being
considered for action by the Planning Commission. If recommended by
the Director of Planning, the Planning Commission may waive the study
period.
4. During the study period and prior to submission to the Planning
Commission for consideration, the plat will be reviewed by all applicable
utilities and departments. Based on this review the developer or his agent
may be requested to furnish additional information. Such information must
be submitted to the Planning Department prior to the plat being placed on
the agenda.
12
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
5. Prior to the meeting at which the preliminary plat will be considered for
action, the Secretary will send written notice of the meeting to the
developer. The developer shall be physically present at the meeting(s) to
answer questions and hear suggestions about his proposed development
or be represented by an authorized agent as discussed in Section A (2) of
this Article. Should the developer or his authorized agent not be present
at the meeting at which the Preliminary Plat is considered for action, the
Planning Commission may table the review of said plat.
6. At the meeting at which the preliminary plat has been placed on the
agenda of the Planning Commission as an “action item”, the Planning
Commission shall review said plat and indicate its approval, approval
subject to modifications, or disapproval. If a plat is disapproved, reasons
for such disapproval shall be stated in writing. If approved subject to
modifications, the nature of the required modifications shall be indicated.
7. If a plat has been disapproved, a new plat may be presented as though no
previous plat had been submitted. If a plat has been approved, or
approved subject to modifications, and the developer desires to make
modifications other than those already required by the Planning
Commission, a new preliminary plat must be submitted, which is subject to
the same regulations and procedures as though no previous plat had been
submitted, except that a certification to the effect that the previous plat has
been withdrawn must be submitted. If the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation rejects any lot(s) or recommends any
alteration of lot size or shape, the Planning Commission may require the
plat to be resubmitted for preliminary plat review.
8. The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute acceptance of any final plat.
9. Expiration of Preliminary Plat Approval
The approval of the preliminary plat shall terminate unless a final plat
based thereon is submitted within one (1) year from the date of such
approval; provided, however, that an extension of time can be applied for
by the developer and granted by the Planning Commission. A fee of
$50.00 is required for all extension requests. If no work has begun to
install improvements and if an approved final plat has not been financially
guaranteed, and the Cookeville Municipal Subdivision Regulations have
changed, the subdivision must meet the new regulations.
E. Pre-Construction Meeting
Following the approval of the preliminary plat but prior to beginning construction
of any required improvements the developer and/or his contractor or contractors
shall meet with appropriate representatives of the applicable reviewing agencies
to review the required standards and procedures for the completion of the
required improvements. The improvements for which a pre-construction meeting
is required include, but is not limited to, water, sewer, streets and drainage
facilities.
13
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
F. Notice to Proceed
After review and approval of the preliminary plat and after completion of preconstruction
meetings, the Planning Department will issue a Notice to Proceed.
Said notice will include the conditions of approval specified by the Planning
Commission and any correction and/or modifications to the preliminary plat
required by the commission. The Notice to Proceed will not become effective nor
shall construction of the subdivision begin until a revised plat depicting the
corrections and/or modifications required by the Planning Commission has been
submitted to the Planning Department.
G. Procedure for Final Plat Review
The following procedure shall apply for the review of all Final Plats:
1. Filing Deadline
Final plats should be submitted by 12 Noon on the first Monday of the
months that the Planning Commission meets. The developer shall submit
to the Cookeville Planning Department one (1) reproducible copy of any
required final plat of a proposed subdivision. The Planning Department
will distribute copies to all applicable utilities and departments (water,
sewer, fire, telephone, street, electric, or gas, as necessary).
2. The Planning Department shall review the final plat for conformance with
the specifications and standards of these regulations. Plats failing to meet
these requirements will be returned to the developer or his agent for
correction. Upon receipt of the corrected plat, the Secretary will place the
item on the agenda.
3. The submission of the final plat to the Planning Department shall not
constitute submission of the final plat for consideration by the Planning
Commission. The official submission of the final plat to the Planning
Commission is considered to be the first Planning Commission meeting at
which the plat is presented for consideration.
4. Prior to the meeting at which the final plat will be considered for action, the
Secretary will send written notice of the meeting to the developer. The
developer or his authorized agent shall be physically present at the
meeting(s) to answer questions and provide information. Should the
developer or his authorized agent not be present at the meeting at which
the final plat is considered for action, the Planning Commission may table
the review of said plat.
5. At the meeting at which the final plat is presented for consideration the
Planning Commission shall review such plat and indicate its approval,
conditional approval, or disapproval. The Planning Commission may also
table the approval of the plat to allow for further study for a period not to
exceed 35 days or by the next meeting, which ever occurs first as
specified in Section 13-4-304 of the Tennessee Code Annotated. If the
plat is disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the
records of the Planning Commission and to the developer in writing. If
conditionally approved, the nature of the required conditions and the time
frame for completing same shall also be so indicated.
14
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
6. Time Frame for Completing Conditions for Final Approval
If a final plat is given conditional approval a time frame for completing the
conditions shall be established by the Planning Commission. In no case
shall this time frame for completion exceed ninety (90) days. If the
conditions for approval are not completed within the established time
frame, then the plat shall be considered disapproved and must be
resubmitted for approval. Requests for extensions of the time frame may
be considered by the Planning Commission, provided such requests are
submitted prior to the expiration of the established time frame.
7. When the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission, the
original will be returned to the developer with the approval of the Planning
Commission certified thereon.
8. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute
the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets, utilities,
easements, or other facilities shown on said plat.
9. As-built Plans Required
The Planning Commission shall require that an accurate map ("as-built"
drawings) of all drainage facilities, water lines, valves, fire hydrants, sewer
lines and appurtenances be supplied by the developer to the City of
Cookeville as a condition for final approval of any plat. State law requires
that plans and specifications of all water and waste water facilities shall be
prepared by a registered engineer and approved by the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation. A copy of such plans shall
be forwarded by the developer to the City of Cookeville.
10. Completion of Improvements Required
Approval of the final plat can not be given until completion and approval of
the required improvements (within one (1) year following preliminary plat
approval) or until a financial guarantee has been posted with the City of
Cookeville to ensure the completion of the required improvements. These
improvements are to be installed in accordance with Articles V through XII
of these regulations. The required improvements must be approved by
the applicable reviewing agencies, and then be reported to the Planning
Commission. The required improvements include:
a. Storm drainage system
b. Street grading, pavement base, binder surface, and sidewalks
c. Water supply system lines, laterals, and fire hydrants
d. Sewage collection lines and laterals (if applicable)
e. Street name and warning or regulatory signs
f. Any other improvements that may be required by the Planning
Commission

affixed thereto, the Department of Planning shall place said plat on record at the
office of the Register of Deeds of Putnam County, Tennessee.
O. Grounds for Denying Plat Approval
The Cookeville Municipal Planning Commission shall deny approval of any plat
submitted to it for review that does not meet or exceed the minimum
requirements set forth in these regulations. In addition, the Planning
Commission may deny approval of a plat for the subdivision of land for which:
1. The available water supply is inadequate to serve the anticipated
development or the available water supply is inadequate to provide fire
protection; or
2. The means of ingress and egress is inadequate to carry the vehicular
traffic projected to be generated by the proposed subdivision or the means
of ingress and egress is inadequate for use by garbage trucks, fire trucks
or other city-owned equipment; or

ARTICLE IV LAND SUITABILITY AND NATURAL FEATURES
A. Land Physically Unsuitable for Subdivision
1. Land where flooding, sink holes, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, and other such features which may endanger health, life, or
property, aggravate erosion, increase public funds for supply and
maintenance of services, and
2. Land which other public agencies have investigated and found in the best
interest of the public not suitable for the type of platting and development
proposed shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by
subdivision of such land. Such land within any plat shall be set aside for
such uses as shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
B. Land Unsuitably Located for Subdivision
1. The Planning Commission shall not approve what it considers to be
scattered or premature subdivision of land which would endanger health,
safety, or property because of lack of or adverse effect on water supply,
schools, proper drainage, good transportation, or other public services or
which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the
supply or maintenance of such services.
2. Land unsuitable for subdividing is also that located in close proximity to
potentially hazardous commercial operations which may endanger health,
life, or property of the residents of the proposed subdivision.
C. Preservation of Natural Features
The developer shall, wherever possible, attempt to preserve all natural features
which add value to residential developments and to the community, such as large
trees or groves, water courses and falls, historic spots, vistas and similar
irreplaceable assets.
D. Special Requirements for Floodable Areas
The purpose of this section is for the review of subdivision proposals to
determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. In order
to accomplish this, the following regulations shall apply:
1. Definition of Land Subject to Flooding
a. For the purpose of these regulations, land subject to flooding shall
be defined as those areas within the City of Cookeville shown as
either a 100-year flood area (Zone A) on the Flood Insurance Rate
Maps for Putnam County and the City of Cookeville, dated May 16,
2007 or any subsequent amendment or revision to said maps.
26
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
b. In addition, along all other streams and water courses not shown as
floodable by the Flood Hazard Boundary Maps or Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, all land located within a distance of the stream bank
equal to two (2) times the width of the stream at the top of the bank
or 20 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater,
is considered to be subject to flooding.
2. Regulations for Subdivisions Containing Land Subject to Flooding
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
b. All creeks, lakes, ponds, sinkholes or other drainage areas shall be
shown on the preliminary and final subdivision plat.
c. Every lot platted shall have a flood-free building site.
d. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
e. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
f. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision
proposals containing land subject to flooding.
g. Utilities
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the system.
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration.
(3) If on-site waste disposal septic systems are to be used, a
flood-free site shall be provided on each lot in order to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding.
(4) A restriction shall be noted on the final plat requiring that all
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.

(1) Land subject to flooding may be platted for residential use
only if filled to such a height as will secure a flood-free site
based on data submitted by the subdivider and prepared by
registered professional engineers, provided such use of fill
does not endanger health, life, or property or restrict the flow
of water or increase flood heights at the property being
subdivided or any other property. Lots on fill will not usually
be approved for septic tank drain fields. In order to be
considered for development such lots must be served by a
public sewer system.
(2) No fill shall be placed in the floodway of the stream and if
undetermined no closer than 20 feet from the top of the bank
of any stream or water course unless the subdivider
demonstrates that a lesser distance (but not less than 15
feet) is adequate based on watershed area, the probable
runoff, and other topographic and hydraulic data prepared by
registered professional engineers.
(3) All bridges, culverts, and other drainage openings shall be
designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and unduly
increase flood heights upstream.
28
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE V STREETS - DESIGN STANDARDS AND
SPECIFICATIONS
The following standards shall apply for the design of all streets in subdivisions located in
the City of Cookeville.
A. General Standards of Design
1. Arrangement
The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets of adjoining subdivisions, and for proper
projection of principal streets into adjoining properties which are not yet
subdivided. The continuation of principal streets is necessary for the
adequate movement of traffic and for the construction or extension of
utilities and public services such as sewers, water and drainage facilities.
Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
topographic or other conditions make such continuance undesirable or
impracticable, the above conditions may be modified. The curvilinear
street layout will be encouraged by the Planning Commission.
2. Conformity to the Major Street Plan
The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official
Major Street Plan. The latest Major Street Plan Map is on file in the Office
of the Putnam County Register of Deeds and a copy of said plan is
included in the front of this document.
Where a street designated by the Major Street Plan as a "Proposed
Street" crosses the proposed site of subdivision, right-of-way sufficient to
meet the design standards for the functional classification of said street
shall be dedicated to the public and shown on said plat.
3. Points of Access
A minimum of two points of access shall be required for all subdivisions
containing more than twenty (20) lots.
a. In order to meet this requirement, the Planning Commission may
require the dedication of unimproved right-of-ways to the property
line of a subdivision to allow for the future extension of streets.
b. This provision may be waived if and when the Planning
Commission determines that the physical characteristics of the site
of the proposed subdivision or the nature of the streets adjacent to
it make the provision of two or more access points impractical.
29
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
4. Linkage of Subdivisions
Streets in proposed subdivisions shall be linked to existing street right-ofways
or existing unimproved right-of-ways as provided for above. When a
proposed subdivision is linked to an existing unimproved right-of-way the
developer shall improve the existing unimproved right-of-way to meet the
required standards for street construction. This provision may be waived
or reduced by the Planning Commission when the length of the
unimproved right-of-way exceeds 150 feet.
5. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The proposed street system shall extend any adjoining existing streets at
the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum
width.
6. Relation to Topography
The street plan of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical relationship
to the topography of the property, and all streets shall be arranged so as
to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of
the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as practicable to
the original topography.
7. Flood Prevention
Streets that will be subject to inundation or flooding shall not be approved.
All streets must be located at elevations which will make them flood-free in
order that portions of the subdivision will not be isolated by floods. Where
flood conditions are anticipated, profiles and elevations of streets will be
required in order to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed
street layout.
B. Street Classifications
The street and road system of the City of Cookeville shall have the following
classifications:
1. Arterial Streets: Streets and highways that are used primarily for
movement of fast or heavy traffic within and through the municipality; a
secondary function is land access. These streets are usually shown on
the Major Street Plan and are generally State and Federal Highways.
Arterial streets may be classified as Major or Minor depending on their
traffic volumes and their relative importance in the intercity street network.
2. Collector Streets: Streets that carry traffic from local streets to the arterial
streets and highways. This usually includes the principal entrance
street(s) or streets of major circulation of a residential development.
Collector streets may be classified as Major or Minor depending on their
traffic volumes and their relative importance in the intercity street network.
For construction purposes, all streets intended for industrial developments
and/or large scale commercial developments shall be classified as Major
Collector Streets.
30
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
3. Local Streets: Streets designated to accommodate local traffic, the major
portion of which originates along the street itself. The major function of a
local street is land access. These may also be called minor residential or
minor commercial streets. A cul-de-sac is a local street intended to be a
permanent dead-end with a paved turnaround designed so that it cannot
be extended in the future. A marginal access street is a local street
parallel and adjacent to an arterial or collector street designed to provide
access to abutting land use and to provide protection from through traffic.
4. Alleys: Streets used primarily for service access to the back and/or side of
land uses otherwise on a public street.
C. Minimum Street Right-of-Way Widths
The minimum width of the street right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line,
shall be as shown on the Major Street Plan, or if not shown on such plan, shall
be not less than as listed below. (See Table 1, page 40).
1. Local Streets ..................... 45 - 50 feet*
2. Cul-de-sacs....................... 100 feet turnaround diameter
3. Collector Streets................ 50 - 80 feet
4. Arterial Streets .................. 80 - 120 feet
5. Alley…………………………20 feet
*When curb and gutter and storm sewer is installed on both sides of local streets
the Planning Commission may allow a reduced right-of-way width of no less than
40 feet, provided there is adequate width for the location of sidewalks and
utilities.
31
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
D. Minimum Street Surfacing Widths
The minimum street surfacing widths shall be as follows: (See Table 1, page 40).
1. Local Streets………………20 feet, 18 feet with curb and gutter*
2. Cul-de-sacs....................... 80 feet turnaround diameter
3. Collector Streets
Minor………………………24 feet, 22 feet with curb and gutter
Major………………………36 feet with curb and gutter
4. Arterial Streets
Minor………………………48 feet with curb and gutter
Major………………………60 feet with curb and gutter
5. Alley………………………...16 feet
* When curb and gutter is installed on both sides of the street, pavement width
for local streets shall be measured from the edge of the gutter. All other
classifications shall be measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement.
E. Additional Right-of-Way on Existing Streets
Plats for subdivisions that abut existing streets shall show the dedication of
additional right-of-way to meet the minimum right-of-way width requirements.
1. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision
is on both sides of the existing street.
2. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street,
one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way, measured from the center line
of the existing street, shall be provided.
3. The dedication of additional right-of-way shall not be required on streets or
routes maintained by the State of Tennessee.
4. When it can be established and demonstrated by the developer that the
mandatory dedication required herein will create an unreasonable
hardship, the Planning Commission may waive or vary the requirements
for the dedication of additional right-of-way. In general these requirements
shall not be considered to create a hardship unless imposition of the full
requirement will create a non-conforming lot or structure as defined by the
Zoning Code.
F. Substandard Existing Streets
The subdivision of property abutting existing streets that do not meet the
minimum construction standards of these regulations shall generally be
prohibited. Should improvements to the existing street be required in order to
meet the demands of the proposed subdivision, the cost of said improvements
shall be borne by the developer unless determined otherwise by the City of
Cookeville.
32
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
G. Street Grades
1. Minimum Grade
The minimum grade of any street shall not be less than one-half (1/2) of
one (1) percent.
2. Maximum Grades
The maximum street grades by street classification shall be as follows:
a. Arterial Streets…………………………..Six (6) percent
b. Collector Streets…………………………Eight (8) percent
c. Local Streets……………………………..Ten (10) percent*
*When special topographic or other conditions warrant, the Planning
Commission, upon recommendation of the Public Works Department, may
permit a grade of up to twelve (12) percent on a local street.
3. Maximum Grades at Intersections
No more than three (3) percent grade within 100 feet of any intersection
with a collector or arterial street nor within 50 feet of any intersection with
a local street shall be allowed.
4. Changes in Grade
Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed
so as to afford a minimum sight distance of 200 feet, said sight distance
being measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and
one-half (4 1/2) feet above the pavement surface.
5. Street Profiles
Upon preliminary plat approval, if the street grade appears questionable,
the Planning Commission may require a street profile drawing. If required,
street profiles shall show natural and finished grades and shall be drawn
to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one
(1) inch equals ten (10) feet vertical.
33
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
H. Horizontal Curves, Vertical Curves, and Tangents
1. Arterial and Collector Streets
The geometric criteria applied to the design of an arterial or collector street
is a function of the design speed defined for the given classification.
Therefore, the accepted minimum limits for horizontal curves, vertical
curves and tangents are also a function of design speed. In general the
following design speeds will apply for arterial and collector streets within
the City of Cookeville:
a. Arterial Streets……………………45 mph
b. Collector Streets………………….30 mph
These stated design speeds may be varied by the Public Works
Department when physical features such as topography or existing land
use impact the location or configuration of a specific street. However, for
the purpose of these regulations, these design speeds shall be used to
determine the minimum acceptable limits for horizontal curves, vertical
curves and tangents. Said limits shall be determined according to the
methodology in A POLICY ON GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF HIGHWAYS
AND STREETS, AASHTO, current edition, or any subsequent non-metric
editions.
2. Local Streets
The minimum horizontal curve, vertical curve and tangent for local streets
shall be as follows:
a. Horizontal Curve…………………150 foot radius
b. Vertical Curve…………………….200 foot sight distance
c. Tangent……………………………160 feet
I. Intersections
1. Design
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible and no
intersection shall be at the angle of less than 60 degrees. (See Illustration
3 in Appendix A).
No street intersection shall have more than four streets entering it, and the
"T" or three-way intersection shall be used whenever possible. Additional
street right-of-way on local streets may be required at intersections with
collector or arterial streets to permit proper intersection design for traffic
flow.
2. Street Jogs
Street jogs with centerline off-sets of less than 150 feet shall not be
allowed if the proposed street is to connect with or is an arterial or
collector street. Street jogs on local streets with centerline off-sets of less
than 125 feet shall not be allowed. (See Illustration 4 in Appendix A).
34
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
3. Spacing
Intersections shall be spaced as follows:
a. Arterial intersecting Arterial…………………….. 500 feet
b. Collector intersecting Arterial……………………400 feet
c. Collector intersecting Collector………………....300 feet
d. Local intersecting Arterial………………………..500 feet
e. Local intersecting Collector……………………...300 feet
f. Local intersecting Local……………………….…200 feet
4. Visibility of Intersections; Steep Grades and Curves
A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. In order to
provide visibility for traffic safety, that portion of any corner lot (whether at
an intersection entirely within the subdivision or of a new street with an
existing street) shall be leveled and cleared of brush (except isolated
trees) and obstructions above the level three feet higher than the
centerline of the street. If directed, the ground shall be excavated to
achieve visibility.
5. Driveways
Driveways located adjacent to intersections shall be separated from the
cross street so that the distance from the nearest driveway radius to the
edge of the pavement of the cross street, ignoring any radius along said
street, shall be no less than fifty (50) feet or as determined by the Director
of Public Works or his designee. (See Illustration 5 in Appendix A). In
cases where the angle of intersection differs from ninety (90) degrees, the
minimum separation shall be determined in accordance with “Guidelines
for Driveway Design” as published by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers. Said determination shall be made by the Director of Public
Works or his designee.
NOTE: This regulation can affect the minimum width of a corner lot.
Refer to the Zoning Code for the appropriate driveway width and turning
radius of each zoning district.
6. Turning Radius
a. Curve radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20 feet and
where the angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees, the
Planning Commission may require a greater curve radius. (See
Illustration 6 in Appendix A).
35
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
b. In cases where a single radius curve does not provide adequate
turning radius for vehicles, then the Director of Public Works, or his
designee, may determine that a three-centered compound curve or
a single radius curve with taper be required. In making such a
determination, the WB-40 design vehicle as defined by AASHTO
will be used. The design of a three-centered compound curve or
single radius curve shall be according to the methodology defined
in A POLICY ON GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF HIGHWAYS AND
STREETS, AASHTO, current edition. Illustration 7 in Appendix A
depicts examples of accepted turning radii.
c. To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius
without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal
width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or
otherwise set back to permit such construction.
J. Dead-End Streets (Cul-de-sacs)
1. Length
No dead-end street (cul-de-sac) will be permitted which exceeds 1200 feet
in length or serves more than twenty (20) lots, whichever is less, unless
specifically authorized as a variance by the Planning Commission.
2. Design
Each dead-end street (cul-de-sac) shall be provided at the closed end with
a circular turnaround having an outside pavement diameter of at least 80
feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. The circular
turnaround may be centered on the main body of the street or off-set to
either side. (See Illustration 8 in Appendix A for examples of accepted culde-
sac designs).
To accommodate large trucks in commercial or industrial subdivisions, the
Planning Commission may require, if determined as necessary by the
Public Works Department, that the circular turnaround have an outside
pavement diameter of up to 100 feet and a street right-of-way diameter of
up to 120 feet.
3. Alternate Designs
When approved by the Planning Commission, alternate designs, including
a "T" or "hammer head" configuration, may be used in lieu of the circular
cul-de-sac. The pavement and shoulder of each leg of such a cul-de-sac
shall be the same as the main body of the street; the turning radii leading
to each leg shall not be less than 25 feet; and the length of the cul-de-sac
across the top of the “T” shall not be less than 100 feet.
36
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
4. Temporary
Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end
streets shall be provided with a temporary paved turnaround having a
roadway surface diameter of at least 80 feet.
K. Private Streets or Permanent Vehicular Easements
1. The Planning Commission discourages the platting of private streets or
permanent vehicular easements as every subdivided property should be
served from a publicly dedicated street.
2. Private streets and permanent vehicular easements shall be developed to
meet all standards required for municipal streets as provided in these
regulations. These include, but are not limited to, all requirements for
street right-of-way widths, minimum surfacing widths, street grades,
curves, intersections, street names, curbs, sidewalks, and street
construction procedures and specifications.
3. When private streets or permanent vehicular easements are permitted by
the Planning Commission, the developer shall provide to the City of
Cookeville provisions for the perpetual maintenance of the private street or
permanent vehicular easement. Said provisions shall be referenced on
the final plat and recorded with the Putnam County Register of Deeds.
L. Reserve Strips
There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the
control of such strips is definitely placed with the municipality under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission.
M. Special Treatment Along Major Arterial Streets
When a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major arterial
street, the commission may require either marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the
rear property line, lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
N. Streets in Commercial Subdivision Developments
1. Service Streets or Loading Space in Commercial Developments
Paved rear service streets or alleys of not less than 30 feet in right-of-way
width, or adequate off-street loading space with a suitable paved surface
shall be provided in connection with lots designed for commercial use.
Service streets, alleys, and off-street loading spaces shall generally not be
dedicated to, or accepted by the City of Cookeville.
37
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
2. Free Flow of Vehicular Traffic Abutting Commercial Developments
In front of areas designed for commercial use, the street's width shall be
increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by
the Planning Commission to assure the free flow of through traffic without
interference by parked or parking vehicles, and to provide adequate and
safe parking space for such commercial or business district.
O. Street Names
1. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with others already
existing and named, shall bear the name of existing streets.
2. New street names shall be substantially different so as not to be confused
in sound or spelling with present street names as shown on the Cookeville
or Putnam County Official Street/Road Name Maps. The only exception to
this policy is where a proposed street is an extension of (or is in alignment
with) an existing street. Generally, no street should change direction by
more than 90 degrees without a change in street name.
3. Street Name Signs
The developer is required to erect street name signs in subdivisions within
the City of Cookeville. These add value to land subdivision and enable
strangers, delivery concerns, emergency vehicles, and even potential
buyers to find their way around. The developer should consult with the
Cookeville Public Works Department for installation standards.
P. Warning and Regulatory Signs
The developer is required to install warning and regulatory signs at appropriate
locations in the subdivision (stop signs, etc.). The Public Works Department
shall be consulted for proper location and installation standards.
Q. Subdivision Identification Signs
1. No subdivision identification sign shall exceed 64 square feet in size.
2. Subdivision identification signs proposed for location on islands within the
street right-of-way shall be depicted on the final plat and shall be designed
to meet the following standards:
a. A minimum street pavement width of 12 feet shall be provided on
both sides of the island for the subdivision identification sign.
Additional street right-of-way, if determined necessary by the
Planning or Public Works Departments, shall be provided.
b. The identification sign shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from
the intersecting street right-of-way.
38
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
c. The City of Cookeville shall not be responsible for the maintenance
of subdivision entrance signs and/or islands. Provisions for the
permanent maintenance of subdivision entrance signs and/or
islands shall be specified by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission.
3. Subdivision entrance signs located on corner lots shall meet the following
standards:
a. To maintain visibility at intersections an obstruction free area shall
be provided in which no sign or other object between the height of
two (2) feet and ten (10) feet shall be permitted. The obstruction
free area is defined by extending the edges of pavement of the
intersecting streets, ignoring any radius, to a point. From this point,
two other points are established by measuring 50 feet along the
edge of the pavement of each street. These two points are then
joined together to establish the limits of the obstruction free area.
b. The City of Cookeville shall not be responsible for the maintenance
of subdivision entrance signs and/or islands. Provisions for the
permanent maintenance of subdivision entrance signs and/or
islands shall be specified by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission.
4. Illustration 9 in Appendix A depicts acceptable locations for subdivision
identification signs.
39
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE VI STREETS - CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES AND
SPECIFICATIONS
The following procedures and specifications shall apply for the construction of all streets
in subdivisions located in the City of Cookeville.
A. Street Construction Cross-Sections
1. The minimum street construction cross-section for each functional
classification of a street shall be as depicted in Table 1, page 40.

later use as a topping-out material for seeding and sodding.
2. Appropriate erosion control methods as specified by the Department of
Public Works shall be applied in the preparation of the subgrade.
3. If rock is encountered, it shall be removed or scarified to provide adequate
roadway drainage.
4. Fill
Within any portion of a street right-of-way requiring fill material, such
material shall be compacted to 95 percent of the Standard Optimum
Proctor Density (ASTM D698-91). To attain this compaction, the following
procedures shall be followed:
(a) Fill material shall be evenly and uniformly spread in lifts not to
exceed six (6) inches in thickness over the entire width and
thickness of the roadway.
(b) Each lift shall be thoroughly rolled with an approved sheep’s foot or
vibratory compactor.
(c) Soils which are too wet shall be allowed to dry before compaction is
attempted.
(d) Soils shall be within plus or minus three (3) percent of the optimum
moisture content.

Notes:
1. Within the corporate limits, sidewalks are required on a minimum of one side on all local and minor collector streets and on both
sides of all major collector and arterial streets.
2. Sidewalks are to be installed a minimum of 2 feet from the edge of the street or back of curb.
3. Storm sewers are required whenever extruded curb or integral curb and gutter are installed.
4. Integral curb and gutter is required on all major collector and arterial streets.
5. All streets constructed for commercial and industrial subdivisions shall, at a minimum, be constructed to major collector street
standards.
41
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
5. The subgrade shall be constructed according to Section 207 of the
Tennessee Department of Transportation's "Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction" current edition, and any subsequent
amendments. Cut and fill slopes shall generally not exceed a grade of
3:1.
6. After grading is completed, and before the pavement base is applied, all of
the underground work (water and sewer lines, any other utilities, service
connections, and drainage culverts) shall be installed completely
throughout the length and width of the subgrade.
7. Where the subgrade is cut for the installation of underground utilities, the
trench shall be backfilled with crushed stone 3/4 inches and down in size
with fines and the utilities shall be properly bedded in suitable material,
depending on subgrade. The backfill shall be thoroughly compacted in
layers not to exceed six (6) inches in thickness, by vibratory or pneumatic
tamping equipment. Backfills shall be compacted to 95 percent of the
Standard Optimum Proctor Density.
8. The finished subgrade shall provide for the superelevation and crown of
the roadway. (See Illustrations 10 through 13 in Appendix A for typical
section).
9. The Planning or Public Works Departments may request that the
developer provide compaction tests prepared by an independent testing
laboratory for the subgrade and/or back-filled utility trenches.
C. Street Drainage
1. An adequate drainage system, including necessary storm sewers, open
ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc.,
shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.
2. All street side ditches shall be built to a grade that will provide good
drainage. The maximum side slope permitted on ditches is 3:1. The
minimum bottom grade on ditches shall be one (1) percent. All drainage
ditches shall be stabilized to prevent erosion.
3. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and
shall be of sufficient length to permit full width of the subgrade and the
required slopes.
4. All cross drains that are to be laid under the roadway shall be of concrete
construction (minimum Class III).
5. The size openings to be provided shall be determined by the Rational
Formula, but in no case shall the pipe be less than 15 inches in diameter.
6. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on
bedded stone a minimum of four (4) inches in thickness. Cross drains
shall not be laid on rock.
42
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
7. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow
and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth
uniform invert.
8. Head walls shall be provided at the inlet and outlet of all cross drains.
Wing walls may also be required if determined as necessary by the Public
Works Department. Illustration 17 in Appendix A depicts accepted forms
of headwalls.
9. All drain pipes and culverts shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the
subgrade to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the
top of the pipe be less than one (1) foot below the finished subgrade.
10. The drainage system should be designed based on a storm frequency of
10 years. However, if the 10-year design flow is greater than 100 cubic
feet per second, the system shall be capable of accommodating the 100-
year design flow within the drainage easement.
11. In those cases where the drainage system relies on sinkholes for
discharge, it should be capable of accepting the 100-year design flow
within the dedicated easement.
12. The drainage conduits shall maintain a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per

a. Composition. Manholes shall be composed of precast
concrete and shall be factory coated.
b. Spacing. Manholes shall be spaced at distances not greater
than 450 feet apart. Greater spacing may be permitted when
authorized by the Department of Water Quality Control and
approved by the Planning Commission.
c. Drop Manholes. A drop pipe shall be provided for a sewer
entering a manhole at an elevation of 24 inches or more above the
manhole invert. All drop manholes shall be constructed as
specified by the Department of Water Quality Control.
d. Size. The minimum diameter of manholes shall be four (4) feet. It
is recommended that four (4) feet be used for pipe 8 to 15 inches in
diameter, five (5) feet be used for pipe 18 to 24 inches in diameter,
and six (6) feet be used for pipe larger than 24 inches in diameter.
e. Invert. The flow channel through manholes shall be made to
the high-water level of flow. A minimum of 0.2 feet of fall shall be
provided across the manhole. Inverts shall be manufactured as an
integral part of all pre-cast manholes unless poured-in-place inverts
are authorized by the Department of Water Quality Control.
f. Frames and Covers. The type of manhole frame and cover
shall be as specified by the Department of Water Quality Control.
All frames shall have an inlet of no less than 24 inches. The

Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
7. Appurtenances. All appurtenances associated with the proposed
sanitary sewerage collection system shall be as specified by the
Department of Water Quality Control.
8. Service Connections. Connections to the sewer system shall be
installed for every lot in the subdivision so that future connections will not
require digging up or tunneling under streets or the interruption of service
to other connections on the system. Such service connections shall be
constructed using methods and materials as specified by the Department
of Water Quality Control. The location of the ends of all sewer laterals
shall be identified by the installation of pressure treated 2” X 4” markers.
H. Protection of Water Supplies
1. Physical Connection Prohibited. There shall be no physical
connection between a sewer system and a public or private potable water
system which would permit the passage of any wastewater or polluted
water into the potable water supply.
2. Horizontal Separation. Whenever possible, sanitary sewers shall be
laid at least ten (10) feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water
main. Should localized conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten (10)
feet, a sanitary sewer may be laid closer than 10 feet to a water main
provided it is laid in a separate trench and provided the elevation of the
top of the sanitary sewer is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the
water main.
3. Vertical Separation. Whenever sanitary sewers must cross under
water mains, the sewer line shall be at such elevation that the top of sewer
line is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. When the
elevation of the sewer line cannot be varied to meet this requirement, the
water main shall be relocated to provide this separation or reconstructed
to provide a distance of ten (10) feet to the joint on either side of the sewer
line. One full length of the water main shall be centered over the sewer
line so that both joints will be as far from the sewer line as possible.
4. Separation Criteria Cannot Be Met. When it is impossible to obtain
proper horizontal and vertical separation as stipulated above, both the
water main and sewer line shall be constructed of ductile iron pipe and
shall be pressure-tested to assure water-tightness.
I. Methods of Construction
All methods of construction and materials utilized in the construction of sanitary
sewerage collection systems in subdivisions located in the City of Cookeville
shall be as specified by the Department of Water Quality Control.
59
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
J. Inspections, Testing and Material Certifications
1. All sanitary sewers and appurtenances are to be inspected by
representatives of the City of Cookeville. Prior to the start of construction,
the developer or his representative shall contact the Planning Department
in order to develop an inspection schedule.
2. As a minimum, all sanitary sewer construction shall be subjected to visual,
vacuum, and pressure testing for leakage, and where flexible pipe is
permitted, deflection testing shall be required. The Department of Water
Quality Control may require other testing, including compaction tests
prepared by an independent testing laboratory for back-filled utility
trenches.
3. No sanitary sewer system shall be accepted by the City of Cookeville until
such system has satisfactorily passed all required testing.
4. The contractor(s) and/or supplier(s) furnishing pipe, manholes, and other
appurtenances may be required to furnish to the City of Cookeville written
certification that the materials used in the construction of sanitary sewer
improvements developed under these regulations meet or exceed the
appropriate specifications.
K. As-Built Drawings
1. Prior to the acceptance of all sanitary sewerage collection systems shown
on plats presented to the Planning Commission, and prior to the release of
any financial guarantee as required by these regulations, the developer
shall submit to the Planning Department a complete set of "as-built"
drawings for said system.
2. A set of as-built drawings shall be kept current and maintained at the jobsite
at all times that work is taking place as required by the rules and
regulations of the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation. Said drawings shall be available, on request, to
representatives of the City of Cookeville.
60
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
L. Subsurface Sewerage Disposal Systems
When it is determined by the Planning Commission that a sanitary sewerage
collection system does not have to be installed in a subdivision, subsurface
sewerage disposal systems (septic tanks or other approved methods) may be
installed in accordance with the requirements of the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation.
1. Submittals. At the time a preliminary plat for a proposed subdivision is
submitted for approval by the Planning Commission, the developer shall
state that said subdivision is to include the installation of subsurface
sewerage disposal systems. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the
developer shall proceed with soil testing and other procedures required by
the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to
determine the suitability of the site of the proposed subdivision for such
systems. Two (2) copies of the soil test results, along with written
approval of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
for the subsurface sewerage disposal system shall be submitted to the
Planning Department at the time the final plat is submitted for
consideration by the Planning Commission.
2. Minimum Lot Size. The minimum lot size for lots served by a subsurface
sewerage disposal system shall be 15,000 square feet. A larger minimum
lot size may be required by the Planning Commission if requested by the
Department of Environment and Conservation.
61
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE X DESIGN STANDARDS FOR LOTS AND BLOCKS
The following standards shall apply for the design of all lots and blocks within
subdivisions located in the City of Cookeville.
A. Monuments
1. Concrete monuments or other markers approved by the Planning
Commission four (4) inches in diameter square, three (3) feet long, with a
flat top, shall be set at points where the street lines intersect the exterior
boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the monument shall have a
metal plate with an indented cross to identify properly the location and
shall be set flush with the finished grade.
2. All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pins or pipe which complies
with the Minimum Standards of Practice of the Tennessee State Board of
Examiners for Land Surveyors.
3. Any permanent monuments or pins disturbed or destroyed during the
development of the subdivision shall be resurveyed and reinstalled at the
expense of the developer.
4. All required monuments shall be in place prior to approval of the final plat
and/or the release of any Financial Guarantees.
B. Adequate Building Site Required
In order to be approved for the construction of a structure, every lot in a proposed
subdivision shall have a suitable building site within the limits of the required
setback lines and outside any existing or proposed easements. In addition, the
following standards shall apply in evaluating the suitability of a lot and/or building
site:
1. The lot arrangement shall be such that in constructing a building there will
be no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other natural
conditions.
2. Lots shall contain a building site that is well drained.
3. Building sites, and sites for drain fields (where applicable) shall not be
traversed by water courses and/or drainage ways.
4. Lots should not be of such depth as to encourage the later creation of a
second building lot at the front or rear.
5. If the subdivision is to be served by public sewer, lots should be designed
so that none will be "below grade" and be rendered unservable by sewer.
6. Fill dirt shall not be placed on areas to be used for drain fields.
7. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to account for the
additional building setbacks required for such lots.
62
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
C. Minimum Lot Size and Width
1. The minimum lot size and widths for lots served by a public sanitary sewer
system shall be in accordance with the provisions in the current Cookeville
Zoning Code.
2. The minimum lot size and lot width for lots not served by a public sanitary
sewer system shall be as follows:
Minimum area…………………………………….15,000 square feet*
Minimum width at building setback line…………………….100 feet*
*Greater minimum area may be required for private sewage disposal if
there are factors of drainage, soil condition or other conditions to cause
potential health problems. The Planning Commission requires that results
from soils tests be submitted in order to approve subdivisions dependent
upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal.
D. Lot Lines
Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to straight street centerline, and
radial to curved street centerline. Rear lot lines should consist of straight lines
with a minimum number of deflections.
E. Building Setback Lines
The minimum depth of building setback lines from all abutting street right-of-ways
and all adjoining property lines shall be in accordance with the requirements in
the current Cookeville Zoning Code.
F. Access and Minimum Street Frontage
1. All lots shall have frontage on a public street, or on a permanent access
easement that has been constructed to the standards specified in these
regulations.
2. All lots shall have a minimum street frontage in accordance with the
requirements in the current Cookeville Zoning Code.
63
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
G. Flag Lots
1. A “Flag Lot” is a lot which is accessed by a strip of land of a width less
than the required street frontage and which is located behind another lot
which meets the required street frontage. Illustration 21 in Appendix A
depicts a typical flag lot.
2. Flag lots shall be permitted only for existing lots of record and only upon
the approval of a variance by the Planning Commission subject to the
following conditions:
a. The parcel of land proposed for subdivision to include a flag lot
shall have depth to width ratio exceeding 2:1.
b. No access strip shall be less than 25 feet in width for its entire
length.
c. The access strip shall provide access for only one lot and shall be
deeded and platted as a part of the building site. No building or
structure shall be located in the access strip.
d. The access strip shall not exceed 500 feet in length and no more
than two access strips shall be located side-by-side.
e. The point where the access strip abuts the public street shall be
safe for vehicular ingress and egress as far as visibility and grade
are concerned since, unlike conventional lots, flag lots have no
other alternatives for driveway locations.
f. All required building setbacks shall apply and be measured from the
boundaries of the portion of the lot excluding the access strip.
g. The developer shall restrict the flag lot from further subdivision
unless a street meeting all requirements, including right-of-way, is
constructed. Said restriction shall be placed on the Final Plat.
3. In no case shall a flag lot be used to avoid constructing a street to the
required standards.
H. Double Frontage Lots
Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where needed to provide for the
separation of development from arterial or collector streets or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. When double frontage lots
are permitted within a proposed subdivision, all buildings may be required to face
the interior street system and vehicular access may be required from the interior
street system.
I. Land Remnants
If, after subdividing, remnants of land exist which have no apparent future use,
they shall be incorporated into the lot(s) adjacent to them.
64
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
J. Reserve Strips
The use of reserve strips is prohibited.
K. Length and Width of Blocks
No block shall be neither less than 400 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length
and shall be a minimum of 200 feet in width. The Planning Commission may
vary these requirements if topography or other physical features warrant such a
variance.
L. Lots on Collector or Arterial Streets
Residential lots having access only from a collector or arterial street may be
required to provide a vehicular turnaround on the lot in order to minimize backing
onto the public street.
M. Off-Street Parking
All residential subdivision lots shall provide sufficient off-street parking space for
at least three (3) vehicles. Non-residential subdivisions shall provide off-street
parking and loading space in accordance with provisions of the Cookeville Zoning
Code.
N. Property Addressing
Each lot within a subdivision shall have a property address assigned to it by the
Planning Department. Property addresses shall be depicted on the final plat
prior to the certification of the Secretary being placed on said plat.
65
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE XI DRAINAGE SYSTEMS – DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
AND INSTALLATION STANDARDS
An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts,
intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage
of all surface water. This will include adequate easements to remove surface water from
the buildable portion of lots.
A. Drainage Plan Required
1. A drainage plan showing proposed modifications to the flow of water
across the site of the proposed subdivision and to and from adjoining
properties shall be prepared and submitted with the preliminary plat of the
subdivision. No work shall be initiated on any drainage system for a
subdivision located in the City of Cookeville until a drainage plan is
submitted to the Planning Department and approved by the Public Works
Department.
2. Any changes to construction documents shall be resubmitted to the
Planning Department. No work shall be initiated on any proposed change
until the revised construction documents are submitted to and approved
by the Planning Department.
B. Removal of Spring and Surface Water
The developer may be required by the Planning Commission to carry away, by
pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist either previous to,
or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the
street right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width.
C. Provisions for Lot Access Required
Where a watercourse separates a proposed street from abutting property,
provisions shall be made for access to all lots by means of culverts or other
structures of design approved by the Public Works Director.
D. Easements
1. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or
channel, a storm water or drainage easement of no less than 20 feet in
width shall be provided.
2. No excavation, filling, landscaping or other construction shall be permitted
in any drainage easement without the approval of the Department of
Public Works.
3. Maintenance of storm water or drainage easements shall be the
responsibility of the property owner(s) unless such easements have been
designated on the Final Plat as drainage rights-of-way and have been
dedicated to and accepted by the City of Cookeville.
66
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
E. Storm Drainage Under Streets
1. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and
shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required
slopes.
2. All cross drains that are to be laid under the roadway shall be a minimum
of Class III concrete construction or HDPE pipe in compliance with current
Tennessee Department of Transportation standards.
3. The size openings to be provided shall be determined by the Rational
Formula, but in no case shall the pipe be less than 15 inches in diameter.
4. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on
bedded stone with a minimum thickness of four (4) inches. Cross drains
shall not be laid on rock.
5. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow
and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth
uniform invert.
6. Head walls shall be provided at each end of all cross drains. If required by
the Department of Public Works, wing walls shall also be provided.
7. Drains shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the subgrade to avoid
dangerous pressure of impact with the top of the pipe at least one (1) foot
below subgrade.
F. Driveway Culverts
Driveway culverts shall be a minimum of 15 inches in diameter. Driveway
culverts may either be corrugated metal, reinforced concrete or HDPE pipe in
compliance with current Tennessee Department of Transportation standards.
G. Accommodation of Potential Upstream Development
A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The design size of such culvert or other
drainage facility shall be based on the assumption that the upstream drainage
area is fully developed.
H. Responsibility for Downstream Drainage
The developer's engineer shall also study the effect of the proposed subdivision
on the existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.
Where it is anticipated that the additional run-off incident to the development of
the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage, provision shall be
made for the improvement of said condition.
67
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
I. Storm Water Retention and/or Detention
The Planning Commission may require storm water retention and/or detention
facilities for subdivisions where the presence of Sinkhole Retention Areas, Flood
Hazard Areas, water courses of limited capacity, or other areas of limited
capacity are the recipients of storm water discharge from the site of said
subdivision. In general, this requirement will apply only to those subdivisions
planned to contain five (5) or more dwelling units or commercial and/or other
structures which will consist of a total of 10,000 or more square feet of
impermeable surface (roof and parking area).
When it is determined by the Planning Commission that storm water retention
and/or detention facilities are required, no plat for such subdivision shall be
approved from which storm water run-off is discharged into public rights-of-way,
public drainage structures or natural water-courses at a rate greater than the rate
which water is being discharged from the site prior to the proposed development
taking place.
The drainage plan accompanying the plat for all subdivisions meeting this criteria
shall show all proposed discharge structures and points of storm water discharge
from the site. Said plans shall be accompanied by a set of calculations which
illustrate the flow of storm water from each existing and proposed discharge point
expressed as cubic feet per second (cfs). Said calculations shall show this
discharge of water under existing and proposed conditions.
J. Land Subject of Flooding
See Article IV, Section D, of these regulations for Special Requirements for
Floodable Areas.
K. Erosion and Sediment Control
The requirements of Title 14, Chapter 5 of the Cookeville Municipal Code,
entitled “Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations”, shall apply for all
subdivision developments located within the City of Cookeville.
L. Stormwater Management
The requirements of Title 14, Chapter 7 of the Cookeville Municipal Code,
entitled “Stormwater Management”, shall apply for all subdivision developments
located within the City of Cookeville.
68
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE XII SPECIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A. Planned Unit Development Subdivision Standards
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to allow flexibility and
innovation in land development and land use. This form of development, which
is also referred to as "cluster development" or "open space development," usually
involves the clustering of dwelling units on certain portions of the site and
generally includes common open space property owned and maintained by a
property owners association. It is an environmentally sound concept, because it
can allow for development in the most suitable areas while preventing
development in unsuitable areas such as flood plains or areas with steep slopes.
Also it is an economically sound concept, because it can reduce the costs for
infrastructure (the length of street and utility lines can be significantly decreased).
The Cookeville Zoning Code provides for two (2) types of Planned Unit
Development Districts: (1) PRD-Planned Residential District and (2) PCDPlanned
Commercial District. These zoning districts allow for the mixture of land
uses such as traditional single-family houses, town houses, apartments, and
some commercial and public uses. Generally, the intent of the Planned Unit
Development is to permit varied lot sizes and clustered development while at the
same time preserving open space without increasing overall density and without
increasing the effective impact on the community.
All Planned Unit Developments or similar such developments shall meet the
following standards:
1. The developer shall meet with the Director of Planning to become familiar
with all applicable requirements.
2. Shall be in compliance with all provisions of the Cookeville Zoning Code.
3. In general, shall meet all requirements and minimum standards of design
required in these regulations.
4. Depending on the design of the development and/or types of residential
units within, some or all of the development may be required to conform to
TCA 66-27-101 through 123, entitled Horizontal Property Act.
B. Large Scale Developments
The requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of large scale
community or neighborhood units, such as a public housing development, mobile
home park or shopping center which is not subdivided into customary lots,
blocks, and streets, if the development is approved by the Planning Commission
and if it is in conformity with the purpose and intent of these regulations.
C. Condominium Developments
Proposed residential or commercial projects which will offer individual attached
units for sale with or without any land, and with certain elements in common to all
units may be required to conform with requirements of TCA 66-27-101 to 123,
entitled the Horizontal Property Act.
69
Cookeville Subdivision Regulations – 2000
ARTICLE XIII ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS
The enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the unapproved recordation or
transfer of land are provided by state law in the authority granted by public acts of the
State of Tennessee.
A. Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land, transfers or sells or
agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by
other use of a plat of subdivision of such land without having submitted a plat of
such subdivision to the City of Cookeville Municipal Planning Commission and
obtained its approval and before such plat be recorded in the office of the county
register, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other
misdemeanors as provided by law, as provided in Section 13-4-306 Tennessee
Code Annotated.
B. The description by metes and bounds in an instrument of transfer or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring a lot in an unapproved
subdivision shall not exempt the transaction from being a subdivision if two (2) or
more lots are being created and does not exempt such transaction from
misdemeanor penalties as provided in Section 13-4-306 Tennessee Code
Annotated.
C. No building permit shall be issued and no building or structure shall be erected
on any lot within the area of jurisdiction of the Planning Commission unless the
street giving access to the lot shall have been accepted or opened as a public
street in accordance with these regulations, or otherwise had received the legal
status of a public street, or unless such street corresponds to a street shown on
an approved plat, etc., as provided in Section 13-4-308 Tennessee Code
Annotated.
D. Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of Section 13-4-308,
Tennessee Code Annotated, shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure,
and the building inspector or the city attorney or other official designated by the
Cookeville City Council may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be
vacated or removed.
E. No board, public officer, or authority shall light any street, lay or authorize the
laying of water mains or sewers or the construction of other facilities or utilities in
any street located within the area of planning jurisdiction, unless such street shall
have been accepted, opened, or otherwise received the legal status of a public
street prior to the adoption of these regulations, or unless such street
corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat
approved by the Planning Commission, or a thoroughfare plan made and
adopted by the commission as provided in Section 13-4-307, Tennessee Code
Annotated.
F. No county register of deeds shall file or record a plat of a subdivision of land
within the City of Cookeville without the approval of the Cookeville Planning
Commission as required by Section 13-4-302, Tennessee Code Annotated.
