full-time permanent employee who is eligible for participation
hereunder.
C. Designation of beneficiary. Any new, full-time employee who becomes a
participant hereunder shall provide a written notice in the manner
prescribed by the plan administrator which designates a beneficiary at
the time participation commences. The participant's election of any
such beneficiary may be rescinded or changed, without the consent of

§ 48-11. Retirement benefits.
contribution. Each participant shall complete the necessary forms to
authorize the payment of participant contributions by way of payroll
deduction in equal and proportionate monthly installments.
B. Reduction of participant contributions. Notwithstanding the preceding
Subsection A, if an actuarial study performed by the actuary shows that
the condition of the pension fund is such that payments into the pension
fund by participants may be reduced below the minimum percentages
prescribed in Subsection A, or may be eliminated, and that if such
payments are reduced or eliminated, contributions by the employer will
not be required to keep the pension fund actuarially sound, the
employer may, on an annual basis, by ordinance or resolution, reduce or
eliminate payments into the pension fund by participants. No liability
under the Police Pension Fund, however, for retirement benefits or
death or disability payments shall be a charge on any other fund of the
Borough, save the Police Pension Fund as herein provided.
C. Employer contributions. The actuary, in accordance with the Act, shall
determine the minimum municipal obligation of the employer. The
employer shall pay into the pension fund, by annual appropriations or
otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum
municipal obligation.
D. State aid. General municipal pension system state aid, or any other
amount of state aid received by the employer in accordance with the
Act from the commonwealth, may be deposited into the pension fund
governed by this plan in amounts determined by the Council and shall
be used to reduce the amount of the minimum municipal obligation of
the employer.
E. Gifts. The Council is authorized to take by gift, grant, devise or
otherwise any money or property, real or personal, for the benefit of the
plan and cause the same to be held as a part of the pension fund. The
care, management, investment and disposal of such amounts shall be
vested in the Council or its delegate, the plan administrator, subject to
the direction of the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and
the terms of the plan.
A. Normal retirement. Each participant shall be entitled to normal
retirement benefits after retirement on or after the participant has
attained normal retirement age.
B. Normal retirement benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled
to a benefit pursuant to Subsection A shall receive a benefit paid
monthly in an amount equal to not more than 50% of the participant's
final monthly average compensation as determined herein.
C. Late retirement. A participant may continue to work beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age, subject to the employer's rules
§ 48-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-11
1:33
and regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met
the requirements of Subsection A continues to work beyond normal
retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until
employment ceases and retirement begins. The retirement benefit of
a participant who retires after attainment of normal retirement age
shall be calculated in accordance with Subsection B on the basis of
the final monthly average compensation as of such participant's actual
retirement date.
D. Service increment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, a participant who shall retire after completion of at least 26
years of aggregate service may be entitled to receive a monthly service
increment benefit; provided, however, that the participant shall have
accrued sufficient service credit pursuant to this Subsection D. Such
service increment shall only be available to a participant who shall
retire on a retirement date after attainment of normal retirement age
and whose aggregate service for purposes of this Subsection D shall
only include periods of time when the participant actively renders
service in employment and periods of military service credit which the
participant has purchased under the definition of "employment" in
§ 48-8 but shall not include any period of time during which the
participant received a disability benefit under the terms of this plan or
was not otherwise in active employment. Such service increment shall
be an amount equal to $100 for each completed year of aggregate
service in excess of 25 years, but shall not exceed $100, and shall be
paid monthly in addition to the amount of normal retirement benefit
calculated pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
E. Payment of benefits. Retirement benefit payments shall be payable as of
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
participant's retirement date and the first day of each month thereafter
during the participant's lifetime. A participant must complete an
application for benefit in the manner prescribed by the plan
administrator and deliver such application to the plan administrator at
least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit payments shall
commence. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
no retirement benefit payments nor any other payments shall be due or
payable on or before the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date that is 30 days after the date the plan administrator
receives the application for benefits. Payment of benefits hereunder
shall cease as of the date of death of the participant.
F. Maximum benefit limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
plan to the contrary, no benefit provided under this plan attributable to
contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual amount, the
amount specified for government plans in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), as
adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d),10 assuming the form of
benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The

1:34
limitations described in this Subsection F shall be governed by the
following conditions and definitions:
(1) Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to
the plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained
herein;
(2) In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of
age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on
an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant
to this subsection commencing at age 62; however, the reduction
shall not reduce the limitation below $75,000 for a benefit
commencing at or after age 55, or, if the benefit commences prior
to attainment of age 55, the amount which is actuarially equivalent
to a benefit of $75,000 commencing at age 55; however, in the case
of a qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a
period of at least 15 years of service, including applicable military
service, as a full-time employee of a police or fire department is
taken into account in determining the amount of benefit), the
limitation contained herein shall not reduce the limitation to an
amount less than the amount specified for government plans
pursuant to Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), and such amount shall be
adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d);11
(3) In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age
65 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined herein
commencing at age 65;
(4) Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
Subsection F, provided that the employer has not at any time
maintained a defined contribution plan in which the participant has
participated; however, in the case of a participant who is not
receiving a disability retirement benefit pursuant to § 48-12B with
fewer than 10 years of participation, the limitation expressed in
this Subsection F(4) shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of
participation less than 10, but in no event shall this limitation be
less than $1,000;
(5) The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all
defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one
defined contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted
consistent with Code Section 41512 and regulations thereunder as
11.Editor's Note: See 26 U.S.C. §§ 415(b)(2)(G) and 415(d).
§ 48-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-11
1:35
applicable to government plans in general and this plan in
particular; and
(6) In the case of a survivor benefit under § 48-13C or a disability
retirement benefit under § 48-12B, the adjustment under
Subsection F(2) hereof shall not apply, and the applicable limitation
shall be the limitation contained herein without regard to the age of
the benefit recipient.
G. Required distributions.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit
of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to death
shall be distributed either:
(a) Not later than the required beginning date; or
(b) Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior
to the date when the entire interest has been distributed after
distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with Subsection
G(1)(b) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution
being used under Subsection G(1)(b) as of the date of death.
(3) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of benefits has begun, the entire interest of such
employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2, and further provided that if the surviving spouse dies before
12.Editor's Note: See 26 U.S.C. § 415.
§ 48-11 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-11
1:36
the distributions to such spouse begin, this subsection shall be
applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
(4) For purposes of this Subsection G, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(b) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(c) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(d) For purposes of this Subsection G, the life expectancy of an
employee and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case
of a life annuity) may be redetermined, but not more frequently
than annually.

beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the
subject of a domestic relations order, entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that provides for the proper distribution of the pension
benefit payments to an alternate payee [e.g., a former spouse of a
participant, child, etc., as provided by Code Section 414(p)(8)13] and
does not require any benefit to be paid in excess of the available earned
and accrued benefit under the plan.
I. Retired participants. Any participant who shall have retired prior to the
restatement date shall not have the benefit altered in any way by the
provisions of this amended and restated plan, except where otherwise
expressly provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to
have their benefits governed by the terms of the plan in effect on the
day preceding the restatement date.

January 1, 1999, and receive a retirement benefit determined pursuant

A. Disability retirement. A participant who shall incur a total and
permanent disability shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit
as of the disability date.
B. Disability retirement benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to a
disability retirement benefit under Subsection A shall receive a benefit
in an amount equal to 50% of the participant's final monthly average
compensation determined as of the disability date multiplied by the
ratio of completed years of service at the disability date to the total
years of service the participant would have attained at normal
retirement age. The amount of disability retirement benefit payable
hereunder shall be reduced by any employer-provided disability
benefits to which the participant is entitled as a result of such
participant's total and permanent disability, including statutory benefits
such as workers' compensation, social security disability benefits and
other insured benefits.
C. Payment of disability benefits. Disability payments shall be made
monthly as of the first day of each month, commencing as of the first
day of the month coincident with or immediately following the date that
the participant incurs the total and permanent disability as certified by
a physician and continuing for the life of the participant, or terminating
earlier should a physician report and certify to Council that the
participant no longer has a total and permanent disability. A participant
who shall fail to return within three months to employment as an
employee of the employer upon cessation of total and permanent
disability prior to attainment of normal retirement age shall be deemed
to have terminated employment as of the disability date, shall be
entitled to either a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant
to § 48-14B or a deferred vested benefit pursuant to § 48-14C and shall
not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan on account of any
aggregate service as of the disability date.
§ 48-11 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-12
1:38
§ 48-13. Death benefits.
D. Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall in its sole
discretion determine whether a participant shall have incurred a total
and permanent disability. The plan administrator shall rely on the
report of a physician acceptable to the plan administrator. If the plan
administrator shall determine that a participant who is totally and
permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to resume active
employment as a police officer or if a participant refuses to undergo a
medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a
medical examination may not be required more frequently than once in
any given twelve-month period), the participant shall cease to be
considered totally and permanently disabled.
E. Cessation of disability. A participant must notify the plan administrator
of any change which may cause a cessation of entitlement to receipt of
any disability retirement benefit hereunder. If a participant fails to
provide immediate notice to the plan administrator of any such change
in status and receives payment of benefits hereunder to which the
participant is not entitled, then the plan may take whatever action is
necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid amounts, including
legal action or offsetting such amounts against any future payments of
retirement or other benefits under the plan, including the costs of such
actions.
A. Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a participant,
there shall be benefits payable in accord with the following subsections
of this section. There shall be no duplication of benefits payable
hereunder, therefore only one benefit shall be payable as a result of the
death of a participant.
B. Killed in service. If the participant dies in the line of duty, survivor
benefits shall be paid by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
accordance with Act 51 of 2009.14 Such benefits shall not be the
responsibility of the employer.
C. Survivor benefit. The surviving spouse of a participant who, prior to
April 18, 2002, retired on pension and dies subsequent to retirement or
who, after April 16, 2002, retires on pension and dies subsequent to
retirement, or, if no spouse survives or if the spouse survives and
subsequently dies, the child or children under the age of 18 years or, if
attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years of such
participant, shall, during his/her lifetime in the case of a surviving
spouse, or until reaching the age of 18 years or, if attending college,
under or attaining the age of 23 years in the case of a child or children,
be entitled to receive a pension calculated at 50% of the pension the
participant was receiving or would have been receiving had the
participant been retired at the time of the participant's death. Payments
shall commence as of the first day of the month following the
14.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 891.
§ 48-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-13
1:39
§ 48-14. Termination of employment.
participant's date of death. The survivor benefit shall be paid monthly
to the surviving spouse of the participant, if any, until the date of death
of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the surviving spouse, or if
there is no surviving spouse, the survivor benefit shall be paid monthly
in equal shares to the surviving dependent children of the deceased
participant if under the age of 18 or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23 years of age. The shares payable to the surviving
dependent children shall be adjusted as each child ceases to be eligible
to receive a share of the benefit hereunder.
D. Death of participant prior to retirement. If a participant shall die before
payment of a benefit has commenced and without eligibility for
payment of a survivor benefit under § 48-13C, the beneficiary shall be
eligible to receive a distribution in an amount equal to the accumulated
contributions of the participant, plus interest as provided in the
definition of "accumulated contributions" in § 48-8 or other increases in
value of the participant's investment in the pension fund, as of the date
of death of the participant or as of the first of the month in which the
death occurred.
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this plan limited to those contained in the
following subsections of this section.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other
than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of
normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a distribution of
accumulated contributions with interest at the rate of 3% per annum.
Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and
beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments from the plan.
C. Deferred vested benefit. A participant who has completed at least 12
years of aggregate service and whose employment with the employer
shall terminate from a full-time position for any reason other than death
or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal
retirement age shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred vested
benefit in lieu of a distribution of accumulated contributions under
Subsection B. The participant must declare his election in writing
within 90 days of the day he ceases to be a full-time police officer with
the Borough. Such a deferred vested benefit shall commence after
application pursuant to § 48-11E as of the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the date on which the participant's
normal retirement age would be attained if the participant continued in
employment until such date. Upon reaching the normal retirement date
and following the participant's application, the participant shall be paid
a partial superannuation retirement allowance determined by applying
the percentage his years of service bears to the years of service which
§ 48-13 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-14
1:40
§ 48-15. Administration.
he would have rendered had he continued to work until his normal
retirement date to the gross pension, using, however, the final monthly
average compensation. Such pension or retirement benefits for any
month shall be computed at no more than 1/2 the final monthly average
compensation of the participant.
A. Plan administrator. The plan administrator shall be the committee or
the individual appointed by the Council who shall have the power and
authority to do all acts and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all
instruments necessary to implement and effectuate the purpose of this
plan. The plan administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf
to any persons it deems appropriate. If a plan administrator is not
appointed, the Council shall be the plan administrator.
B. Police Pension Committee. If the Council shall appoint a Police Pension
Committee to administer the affairs of the plan, the Council shall
delegate such authority as it shall deem appropriate to the Committee.
The Committee shall consist of not more than five members who shall
be appointed by the Council. Each member of the Committee shall
serve in that capacity until death, resignation, removal or otherwise.
Each member may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by
the Council. Each member may resign by delivering written notice to
the Council and other members of the Committee. Vacancies on the
Committee shall be filled in the same manner as the position was
originally filled. The Council is not required to appoint a Police Pension
Committee.
C. Authority and duties of the plan administrator.
(1) The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the
proper administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation
or construction placed upon any term or provision of the plan by
the plan administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken
in good faith shall, upon the Council's review and approval thereof,
be final and conclusive upon all parties hereto, whether employees,
participants or other persons concerned. By way of specification
and not limitation and except as specifically limited hereafter, the
plan administrator is authorized:
(a) To construe this plan;
(b) To determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any
employee to participate herein;
(c) To compute the amount and source of any benefit payable
hereunder to any participant or beneficiary;
(d) To authorize any and all disbursements;
§ 48-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-15
1:41
(e) To prescribe any procedure to be followed by any participant
and/or other person in filing any application or election;
(f) To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required
by law or as the plan administrator deems appropriate,
information explaining the plan;
(g) To require from the employer or any participant such
information as shall be necessary for the proper administration
of the plan; and
(h) To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the
administration of the plan, including such legal, clerical,
accounting and actuarial services as may be required by any
applicable law or laws.
(2) The plan administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from
or modify the terms of the plan or change or add to any benefits
provided by the plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements
of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the plan
administrator shall have no power to adopt, amend, or terminate
the plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to determine or require
any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Council.
D. Police Pension Committee organization. If the Council appoints a
Committee, it may organize itself in any manner deemed appropriate to
effectuate its purposes hereunder, subject to the following:
(1) The Committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time in
office, and such action may be taken either by vote at a meeting or
in writing without a meeting.
(2) The Committee shall, from time to time, appoint a Chairman, a
Secretary who may, but need not, be a Committee member and
such other agents as it may deem advisable.
(3) The Committee may, from time to time, authorize any one or more
of its members to execute any document or documents, including
any application, request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver or
direction, and shall notify the Council, in writing, of the name or
names of the member or members so authorized. In the absence of
a designation, the Chairman shall be deemed to be so authorized.
Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall accept
and be fully protected in relying upon any document executed by
the designated member or members (or the Chairman in the
absence of a designation) as representing a valid action by the
Committee until the Committee shall file with such fiduciary a
written revocation of such designation.
(4) The Committee, or its delegate, shall maintain and keep such
records as are necessary for the efficient operation of the plan or as
§ 48-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-15
1:42
may be required by any applicable law, regulation or ruling and
shall provide for the preparation and filing of such forms or reports
as may be required to be filed with any governmental agency or
department and with the participants and/or other persons entitled
to benefits under the plan.
E. Plan administrator costs. The plan administrator shall serve without
compensation for services unless otherwise agreed by the Council in
writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the functioning of the plan
administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants,
counsel, actuaries and other specialists and other costs of
administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the Council to the extent permitted under applicable law
and not otherwise paid by the employer.
F. Hold harmless. No member of the Council, the plan administrator, the
enrolled actuary, nor any other person involved in the administration of
the plan shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to
act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing
their respective duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent
permitted by law, the employer shall, and hereby does agree to,
indemnify and hold harmless the plan administrator and each successor
and each of any such individual's heirs, executors and administrators,
and the delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or
corporation which is independent of the employer and which renders
services to the plan for a fee) from any and all liability and expenses,
including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit or
proceeding to which he is or may be made a party by reason of being or
having been a member, delegate or appointee of the plan administrator,
except in matters involving criminal liability, intentional or willful
misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a
nature described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification
except to the extent of any deductible amount under the insurance
coverage or to the extent of the amount the claims exceed the insured
amount.
G. Approval of benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
H. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant") shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
§ 48-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-15
1:43
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator, if special circumstances so
require, for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth the specific plan provisions on which the
denial is based; an explanation of additional material or
information, if any necessary to perfect such claim, and a statement
of why such material or information is necessary; and an
explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Council of the
initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of
denial. During such review, the claimant or a duly authorized
representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after receipt of the notice requesting
such review (or, in special circumstances, such as where the
Council in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of
receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person
or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on
which the decision is based.
(4) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(5) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
(6) Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to appeal any final decision hereunder to a court of
competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be
taken until the entire appeal procedure of this Subsection H has
been exhausted.
§ 48-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-16
1:44
§ 48-16. Pension fund.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Council is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject to the
provisions of the laws of the commonwealth and of this plan and
any amendment thereto.
(2) The pension fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the
plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the
expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.
(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the pension fund required under the plan. The
employer shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in
the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the pension fund,
and only to the extent that there are monies available therein. The
pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer under
the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions
hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof.
The pension fund shall be held, managed, and administered
pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the plan, the employer has exclusive authority and
discretion to manage and control the pension fund assets. The
employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or
investment manager at its sole discretion.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition
to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law, unless such duties
are delegated:
(1) To retain in cash so much of the pension fund as it deems advisable
and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial
institution (including any such institution which may be appointed
to serve as trustee hereunder), without liability for interest
thereon. The Council may deposit funds in a federally insured bank
up to the insured limit; however, the Council may deposit pension
funds in excess of the FDIC limit if the excess deposit is secured by
pledge of the Bank of Federal Securities to the satisfaction of the
Borough.
(2) To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and
keep said fund invested, without distinction between principal and
income, in securities which are at the time legal investments for
fiduciaries under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act,15 or
as the same may be subsequently modified or amended.
15.Editor's Note: See now 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 7301 et seq.
§ 48-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-16
1:45
(3) To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
exchange such property; to grant options for the purchase or
exchange thereof.
(4) To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting
property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease,
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation
pursuant to any such plan.
(5) To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the fund.
(6) To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
fund and in connection therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.
(7) To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed to be
appropriate for the purposes of this plan no matter where situated,
including in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve
as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
(8) In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
(9) To maintain and invest the assets of this plan on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans
maintained by the employer, provided that the assets of each
respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
(10) To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to
the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the plan, provided that if a trustee is
§ 48-16 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-16
1:46
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make
payment or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(14) To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the pension fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to
the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to
pay; to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against
or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
(15) To appoint any persons or firms (including but not limited to
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists) or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940,16 is a bank (as defined in that
Act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or
dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be
under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
16.Editor's Note: See 15 U.S.C. § 80b-1 et seq.
§ 48-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-16
1:47
§ 48-17. Amendment and termination of plan.
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
C. Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest
contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days' written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to be
reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
E. Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
A. Amendment of the plan. The employer may amend this plan at any time
or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name
of the employer under its municipal seal by officers duly authorized to
execute such instrument and delivered to the Council; provided,
however:
(1) That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any
beneficiary of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which
§ 48-16 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 48-17
1:48
he is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this plan other than for the benefit of employees, and no
funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan shall, except as
provided in Subsection E, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by
the employer; and
(3) That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 48-18C has been prepared and presented to the Council in
accordance with the Act.
B. Termination of the plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in
writing executed in the name of the employer.
C. Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the pension fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment
for the benefit of its creditors.
D. Distribution upon termination. In the event of the termination of the
plan, all amounts of vested benefits accrued by the affected participants
as of the date of such termination, to the extent funded on such date,
shall be nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the
plan, the employer shall direct either that the plan administrator
continue to hold the vested accrued benefits of participants in the
pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other than
those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such
termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance with the
provisions; or that the plan administrator immediately distribute to
each participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to the
date. If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for
all vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority
shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to
mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are
applied to the distribution of any vested benefits attributable to other
sources hereunder. All other assets attributable to the terminated plan
shall be distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination. In accordance with Section
401(a)(8) of the code,17 any forfeiture shall not be applied to increase
the benefits that any employee would otherwise receive under the plan.
17.Editor's Note: See 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(8).
§ 48-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-17
1:49
§ 48-18. Minimum financing requirements.
E. Residual assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the pension fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of law, and any
remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions, shall be
returned to the commonwealth.
F. Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of the all liabilities
under the plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension
fund, after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their
beneficiaries or their estates.
A. Actuarial valuations. The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial
valuation at least biennially unless the employer is applying or has
applied for supplemental state assistance pursuant to Section 603 of
the Act,18 whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made
annually. Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of
the beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered calendar
year, beginning with the year 1985. Such actuarial valuation shall be
prepared and certified by an approved actuary, as such term is defined
in the Act. The Council may request an actuarial valuation report to be
conducted at any other time as, in its opinion, is necessary to ascertain
the soundness of the fund. The expenses attributable to the preparation
of any actuarial valuation report or investigation required by the Act or
any other expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and
which are directly associated with administering the plan shall be an
allowable administrative expense payable from the assets of the
pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include but not be limited

hour by hour.
B. Duties of chief administrative officer.
(1) Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the chief administrative officer.

given plan year. The chief administrative officer shall submit the
financial requirements of the plan and the minimum municipal
obligation of the employer to the Council annually and shall certify
the accuracy of such calculations and their conformance with the
Act.
C. Benefit plan modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the chief administrative officer of the plan
shall provide to the Council a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary,
which estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the
plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the employer with
respect to the plan.
A. Employment rights. No employee of the employer nor anyone else shall
have any rights whatsoever against the employer or the plan
administrator as a result of this plan except those expressly granted to
them hereunder. Participation in this plan shall not give any right to any
employee to be retained in the employ of the employer, nor shall it
interfere with the right of the employer to discharge any employee and
to deal with such employee without regard to the effect that such
treatment might have upon participation in this plan.
B. Meaning of certain words. For purposes of this plan, the masculine
gender shall include the feminine, and the singular shall include the
plural, and vice versa, in all cases wherever the person or context shall
plainly so require. Headings of sections and subsections are included

C. Construction of document. This plan may be executed and/or
conformed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be

D. Information to be furnished by the employer. The employer shall furnish
to the plan administrator (and, where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the plan.
E. Severability of provisions. Should any provisions of this plan be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan shall be construed
and enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been
inserted herein.
F. Incapacity of participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining the
participant and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for
the participant, may provide for such payment of pension benefits
hereunder to such person or institution so maintaining the participant,
and any such payments so made shall be deemed for every purpose to
have been made to such participant.
G. Personal liability. Subject to the provisions of the Act and unless
otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past,
present or future officer or agent of the employer shall be personally
liable to any participant, beneficiary or other person under any
provision of the plan.
H. Assets of the fund. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give
any participant or beneficiary any interest in any specific property of
the pension fund or any right except to receive such distributions as are
expressly provided for under the plan.
I. Pension fund for sole benefit of participants. The income and principal
of the pension fund are for the sole use and benefit of the participants

414(u).19
(2) Heroes Earning Assistance Tax Relief Act of 2008 (HEART Act).
Except where otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in this
plan, effective for deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007, the
plan will provide benefits and service credit to the extent that the
plan is required and mandated by the HEART Act to provide said
benefits and/or service credit.
(3) Differential wage payments. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the
extent required by the HEART Act, differential wage payments
shall be included in compensation for purposes of determining
benefits.
K. Distributions for health insurance. An eligible retired public safety
officer may elect, in accordance with Code Section 402(l),20 that a
portion of his annuity benefit that would otherwise be paid to him under
the plan instead may be used to purchase health insurance, subject to
the following conditions:
(1) The term "eligible retired public safety officer" means an individual
who, by reason of disability or attainment of normal retirement age,
is separated from service as a public safety officer with the
employer and is a participant in this plan. The term "public safety
officer" shall have the same meaning given such term by Section
1204(9)(A) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968 [42 U.S.C. § 3796b(9)(A)]. Any participant who terminated
employment prior to normal retirement age for any reason other

not eligible to make the election.
(2) Payments shall be made only for qualified health insurance
premiums as that term is used in Code Section 402(l).
(3) An eligible public safety operator may elect to have no more than

§ 93-1. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Slippery
Rock False Alarm Ordinance."
§ 93-2. Findings; intent.
False alarms that are triggered negligently, accidentally or intentionally
cause unnecessary disruption to Borough emergency services and waste

to adopt a policy and regulations which will minimize this disruption.
§ 93-3. Purpose.
This article is adopted for the following purposes:
§ 93-4. Word usage; definitions.
A. To provide for fees and penalties to principal owners, operators,
tenants, and other individuals responsible for false alarms resulting in
unwarranted response by emergency services.
B. To encourage the use of appropriate alarm installation practices to
prevent or minimize false alarms that require the response of
emergency services.

telephone, radio signal, or other means to a person who, in turn,
notifies the Butler County Emergency Services (911) of the alarm.
Alarm systems also include equipment to activate a bell or sounding
device to be heard outside a building which is intended to alert the
police or others to the existence of a crime, fire, or other emergency

stimulus from a sensor that has detected a physical force or condition
characteristic of a fire, intrusion, or other emergency.
AUDIBLE ALARM  Any device, bell, horn, or siren which is attached to
the interior or exterior of a building and emits a warning signal audible
outside the building, which signal is designed to attract attention when
activated by an intrusion or other emergency requiring police or service
response.

group of systems operated privately for customers by an alarm agent;
a firm; or a corporation that accepts messages or signals from alarm

EMERGENCY SERVICES  A public or private agency, corporation
or volunteer company that provides emergency police, fire or medical
services or that dispatches or coordinates such services, including the
personnel of such public or private agency, corporation or volunteer

services respond resulting from the activation of an alarm or alarm
system when a crime, fire, or other emergency warranting immediate
action has not in fact occurred.
INADVERTENT FALSE ALARM  An alarm system activated in the
absence of an emergency, whether by inadvertence, negligence, or
unintentional act, including any mechanical or electrical malfunction of
the alarm system, to which emergency services actually responds.

circumstances where the individual(s) has/have no reasonable basis to
believe that a crime, fire, or other emergency warranting immediate
action has occurred or is occurring.
SILENT ALARM  A alarm system that does not emit an audible signal
or tone when activated at a protected site and is monitored by a central
station system.

1:64
§ 93-6. Administration and enforcement.22
period of 10 minutes if the system activates on or near the premises.
Exceptions shall be made for certified systems requiring longersounding
alarms for insurance purposes, providing that certification
and policy requirements are documented with the Borough, and further
providing that these devices are equipped with timers to disengage the
audible alarm after the minimum time required for certification.
B. The sensory mechanism used in conjunction with an alarm device must
be adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion, so that the
alarm device will not be activated by impulse due to transient pressure
changes in waterlines, short flashes of light, wind effects such as
rattling or vibration of doors or windows, vehicular noises adjacent to
the premises, or other forces unrelated to genuine alarm situations.
C. The alarm device or system must be maintained in good repair to assure
reliable operation.
D. No person shall conduct or test any alarm device or system without first
notifying the alarm agent to ensure that the alarm or signal is not
related to emergency services.

Slippery Rock shall meet the most current applicable standards of the
Underwriters Laboratories, the National Fire Protection Association
and/or any other applicable recognized standards in the industry.
A. The Borough Council shall develop and implement by resolution the
necessary procedures for the effective administration and enforcement
of this article.

submitted for each alarm activation requiring emergency service
response.

period to which emergency services respond. The fine for each
false alarm shall be in an amount as established from time to time
by ordinance, not to exceed $300.
22.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 93-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 93-6
1:65
(2) The fines imposed by Subsection B(1) of this section shall not apply

(b) For new installations, documentation has been provided that
the alarm system was initially installed within six months prior
to the false alarm, no more than three false alarms have
occurred since the installation, and the false alarm is due to a
system malfunction.

alarm is the first through third reported at the subject address
during the calendar year.
(d) An event occurred on the alarmed premises that could not have
been anticipated, and the alarm system detected the
occurrence. Examples might be a ceiling tile falling, a water
pipe bursting, or a repairman causing an inadvertent false
alarm. Leaving a pet loose or a fan on in a room protected by
motion detection would not be events that would be excused.
(e) Multiple alarms emanating from an alarmed facility in a
twelve-hour period shall be treated as a single alarm.
(3) When a fourth false alarm occurs within a consecutive twelvemonth
period, the Slippery Rock Borough Administrator shall notify
the principal owner, operator, tenant, or other individual
responsible for the alarm system from which the false alarm
emanated that a false alarm fine is due and the amount thereof. The
amount of the fine (if any) will be determined in accordance with
Subsection B(1) of this section. Such notice shall be in writing and
mailed to the last known address by regular mail, postage prepaid,
of the principal owner, operator, tenant or other individual
responsible for the alarm system.
(4) The principal owner, operator, tenant, or other individual
responsible for the facility where the false alarm emanated may
provide information in writing to the Slippery Rock Borough
Administrator, providing evidence that one of the circumstances
explained in Subsection B(2) (above) applied.
(5) A false alarm fine shall be due and payable to the Borough 30 days
from the date of the notice of the fine. If the amount is not paid
within the thirty-day period, a certified letter shall be sent by the
Slippery Rock Borough Administrator to the principal owner,
operator, tenant, or other individual responsible for the alarm
system of the alarmed facility demanding payment within 30 days.
If payment is still not made, a law enforcement officer will file a
citation with the Magisterial District Judge.

escrow account with the State Treasurer or any commonwealth bank,
or post an appeal bond to the Council within 30 days in the amount of
the proposed penalty, provided that such bond is executed by a surety
licensed to do business in the commonwealth. If, through administrative
or final judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no

shall conduct a hearing to consider the appellant's alleged inability to
pay within 30 days of the date of the appeal. The Council may waive the
requirement to prepay the civil penalty or to post an appeal bond if the
appellant demonstrates and the Council finds that the appellant is
financially unable to pay. The Council shall issue an order within 30

interest on the penalty amount computed in accordance with Section

assessment of the penalty. If any person liable to pay any such penalty
neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount, together
with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall constitute a debt of
such person, as may be appropriate, to Slippery Rock Borough. The
debt shall constitute a lien on all property owned by said person when a
notice of lien incorporating a description of the property of the person
subject to the action is duly filed with the Prothonotary of the Butler
County Court of Common Pleas.
C. Hearings under this chapter shall be conducted in accordance with the
Local Agency Law.43

1:157
§ 260-11. Appeals process.
Upon receipt of a taxpayer petition relating to assessment, determination
or refund of an eligible tax, the Borough shall review said petition, and, if
the Borough disagrees with the position of the taxpayer or if the Borough
is unable to otherwise resolve the disagreement, the petition shall be
forwarded to the tax appeal hearing board for coordination with all
interested municipalities and for resolution within statutory requirements.
§ 260-12. Disclosure statement.
Every taxpayer is obligated to pay all taxes levied by the Borough,
hereinafter frequently referred to as "municipality," to which the taxpayer
is subject. When taxes are not paid or the Borough has a question about
whether a taxpayer has fulfilled all tax obligations, the Borough has legal
rights to enforce taxpayer obligations. In conjunction with taxpayer
obligations and Borough rights, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has
enacted a Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights which grants legal rights to
taxpayers and creates obligations for municipalities so that equity and
fairness control how municipalities collect taxes. This document is the
disclosure statement required by the bill of rights. This document is merely
a summary of your rights. For a complete statement of your rights and
obligations of the Borough, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 84, Subchapter C.66
§ 260-13. Applicability/eligible taxes.
This disclosure statement applies to eligible taxes levied by the Borough.
For this purpose, eligible taxes include any tax levied by the Borough other
than the real estate tax. This disclosure statement does not apply to real
estate taxes. The specific eligible taxes levied by the Borough are earned
income tax, per capita tax and occupational privilege tax. Unless expressly
provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of any Borough
representative to comply with any provision of this disclosure statement,
related regulations or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the
taxpayer from paying the taxes owed. The earned income tax is collected
and administered by the Borough Earned Income Tax Collector. A separate
(5) Development of the form, content, process and deadlines for
taxpayers to file a tax appeal petition.
(6) Formulation of rules of practice and procedure for hearings.
F. Council shall respond to taxpayer requests for a Local Taxpayers Bill of
Rights by making copies available at the Borough office or mailing at
the Borough's expense.
G. Information obtained by the Borough as a result of an audit, return,
report, investigation, hearing or verification shall be confidential.
66.Editor's Note: See 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8421 et seq.
§ 260-10 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 260-13
1:158
disclosure statement relating to the earned income tax is available from that
office. This disclosure statement does not apply to the earned income tax.
§ 260-14. Borough requests for tax information.
§ 260-15. Tax overpayment refunds.
A. Minimum time period for taxpayer response.
(1) The taxpayer has 30 calendar days from the mailing date to
respond to the Borough requests for tax information.
(2) Upon written request, the Borough will grant reasonable time
extensions for good cause.
(3) The Borough will notify the taxpayer of the procedures to obtain an
extension in its initial request for tax information.
B. Requests for prior year returns.
(1) An initial Borough request may cover only taxes required to be paid
or tax returns required to be filed no more than three years prior to
the mailing date of the request.
(2) The Borough may make a subsequent request relating to other
taxes or returns if, after the initial request, the Borough determines
that the taxpayer failed to file a tax return, underreported income,
or failed to pay a tax for one or more of the tax periods covered by
the initial request.
C. Use of federal tax information. The Borough may require a taxpayer to
provide copies of federal tax returns if the Borough can show that the
information is reasonably necessary for enforcement or collection of a
tax and the information is not available from the Pennsylvania
Department of Revenue or other sources.
A. A taxpayer may file a written request with the Borough for a refund or
credit. The filing of a written request will not preclude a taxpayer from
later filing a tax appeal petition as discussed below. The request must
be made within three years of the due date for filing the return or one
year after payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no return is
required, the request must be made within three years after the
payment due date or within one year after payment, whichever is later.
A tax return filed by the taxpayer showing a tax overpayment will be
considered a written request for a cash refund unless the return
indicates otherwise. If the taxpayer pays a tax as a result of receiving a
notice of underpayment, the taxpayer must file a written request for a
refund within one year of the payment date. Subject to certain
exceptions, the Borough will pay interest, at a rate determined
pursuant to the state law, from the date of overpayment until the date of
resolution.
§ 260-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-15
1:159
§ 260-16. Enforcement.
Depending on the type of tax involved and the specific circumstances, if

Borough has reason to believe might be due, possible Borough enforcement
options include:

taxpayer must file a tax appeal petition with the Borough's office.

or by mailing a request to the above address or by calling the
Borough at (724) 794-6391 during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 3:00
p.m.
C. Decision.
(1) If not otherwise resolved, the hearing board will issue a decision on
tax appeal petitions within 60 days after receipt of a complete and
accurate petition.
(2) If the petition was complete and accurate when filed, the failure to
render a decision within 60 days will result in the petition being
deemed approved.

hearing board to the Court of Common Pleas.
(2) Appeals to the Court must be filed with the Court within 30 days

1:160
§ 260-17. Confidentiality of tax information.
Information gained by the Borough as the result of any audit, report,
investigation, hearing or verification shall be confidential. However,
confidentiality will not preclude disclosure for official purposes, whether
in connection with legal proceedings or otherwise, and will not preclude
disclosure to the extent required by applicable law.
§ 260-18. Taxpayer complaints.
If a taxpayer has a complaint about a Borough action relating to taxes, the
Borough may be contacted in writing at the Slippery Rock Borough office,
306 East Water Street, P.O. Box 83, Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania 16057. The
Borough's counsel and the Borough's Solicitor will facilitate resolution of
the complaint.
§ 260-19. Borough tax appeal information and regulations.
The Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights requires every Borough to adopt
regulations concerning the form and content of petitions, as well as practice
and procedure for tax appeal petitions. This document contains the
regulations required by the Bill of Rights. In addition, the Borough
(hereinafter frequently referred to as "municipality") has published a
disclosure statement required by the Bill of Rights.67
§ 260-20. Tax appeal petitions.
D. The Borough may employ private collection agencies to collect the tax.

§ 260-25. Exemptions.
§ 260-26. Individual tax returns and payments.
Every individual receiving earned income or earning net profits in any tax
year shall file tax returns and pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax
Enabling Act.

The collection and administration of the tax provided for in this article
shall be performed by the Tax Officer appointed by the Butler County Tax

A. Any person whose total income from all sources is less than $12,000 per
annum is exempt from liability for the tax.
B. This governing body finds that minors of various age groups have
traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as comprising
separate classes for many legislative purposes; and minors under the
age of 16 are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory
school attendance and child labor laws, and therefore have limited
earned income and net profits and control of money such that
enforcement of reporting and collection of the tax hereunder against
them would yield inconsequential amounts and be unduly difficult,
expensive and not in the public interest. For these reasons, individuals
under the age of 16 years are exempt from liability for the tax.

73.Editor's Note: See 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8581 et seq.
§ 260-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-36
1:171
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.

1:172
§ 260-37. Duty of employers to collect.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exception certificates, monitoring tax-exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. Slippery Rock Borough, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. Slippery Rock Borough or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
§ 260-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-37
1:173
§ 260-38. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return, showing a computation of the
tax, on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 260-39. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the
first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number
of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
Collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental
reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January
31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records
from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30, and October 1 to December
31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30,
October 30 and January 31, respectively.
§ 260-40. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who has earned income or realized net
profits, as those terms are defined herein, within the political subdivision
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 260-36B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of the calendar year.
§ 260-37 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 260-40
1:174
shall be required to comply with this article and pay the tax due to the
Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 260-41. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 260-42. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 260-43. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works, if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by
him from each employer or self-employed person, together with the
date the tax was received. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept
and keep a record of the information submitted by employers relating to
the number of employees subject to the tax, the number of employees

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall, upon being found
liable therefor, pay a fine of not more than $600, plus court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Borough in the enforcement
proceedings. If the penalty is not paid, the Borough shall initiate a civil
action for collection in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil
Procedure. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense,
exempt from the tax, and employee exemption certificates and refunds
of the tax paid to individuals and employers.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County after exhausting any
administrative remedies, as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If, for any reason, the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of
6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated, beginning with the
due date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

separate offense. In addition to or in lieu of enforcement under this section,
the Borough may enforce this article in equity in the Court of Common Pleas

be instituted against any person in charge of the business of any employer
who shall have failed or who refuses to file a return required by this article.

tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, for calendar year 2005 and all
prior calendar years or of an emergency and municipal services tax, plus
applicable penalties and interest, for calendar years 2006 and 2007, as the
same existed prior to this amendment.
§ 260-48. Estimated tax revenue.
It is estimated that the annual revenue generated from the local services
tax will be approximately $80,000, based upon 2008 projections.
§ 260-49. When effective.
This article shall become effective in accordance with applicable law, with
the repeal of the previous occupational privilege and emergency and
municipal services tax ordinances effective January 1, 2008.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

possible, not to exceed the later of either 48 hours of time immediately
following such emergency or disablement or the next business day
following the emergency or disablement.

written request for continued enforcement from the owner or other
person in charge of such private parking lot is received and continued
enforcement is approved by the President of Borough Council. The
written request must contain a list of all posted signs and their
locations, as well as indication that the posted signs meet the
Department regulation that specifies what constitutes adequate posting
for public notice. Further, the request must indicate a commitment to
pay all costs for all installation and maintenance of signs to meet the

"private parking lot" means a privately owned parking lot open to the
public or used for parking without charge or a privately owned parking
lot used for parking with charge.
C. Property owners remove vehicle. The owner or other person in charge
or possession of any property on which a vehicle is parked or left

right-hand wheels next to the right-hand curb or the left-hand wheels
next to the left-hand curb.
B. Within 12 inches of curb. Vehicles parallel parked shall have all
curbside wheels within 12 inches of the appropriate curb or, in the
absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the edge of the appropriate
shoulder.
C. Inside painted lines. Vehicles shall be parked such that no part of the
vehicle is directly above or outside of the parking guidance lines on the
highway or the curb. This requirement is suspended when the painted
lines are completely obscured by snow or ice.
A. Handicapped 60 minutes extra. When a motor vehicle bearing a
handicapped or severely disabled veteran parking placard as
prescribed in this section is being operated by or for the transportation
of the handicapped person or severely disabled veteran, the driver shall
be relieved of any liability for parking for a period of 60 minutes in
§ 275-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-28
1:199
excess of the legal parking period permitted by Borough Council in
either officially designated handicapped parking locations or in any
other legal parking location, except where local ordinances or police
regulations provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during
morning, afternoon or evening hours. After the extra 60 minutes, an
overtime parking violation has occurred.
B. Handicapped reserve parking.
(1) Upon the annual written request, including substantive
justifications of any handicapped person or severely disabled
veteran, the payment of an annual fee, and the favorable evaluation
of need on a case-by-case basis, Borough Council may erect on the
highway as close as possible to their place of residence a sign or
signs indicating that that place is reserved for the handicapped
person or severely disabled veteran, that no parking is allowed
there by others and that any unauthorized person parking there
shall be subject to a specific penalty and towing of the vehicle.
Borough Council may restrict such handicapped parking with
conditions that circumstances and judgment may warrant. Any
vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated handicapped
parking area may be towed and stored upon authorization of a
police officer or a parking enforcement officer.
(2) Except for persons parking vehicles lawfully bearing a handicapped
or severely disabled veteran registration plate or displaying a
handicapped or severely disabled veteran parking placard when
such vehicles are being operated by or for the transportation of a
handicapped person or a severely disabled veteran, no person shall
park a vehicle on public property posted in accordance with
Departmental regulations which shall require a sign stating the
penalty for violation and a sign indicating that vehicles in violation
may be towed. Signs must be replaced when they become either
obsolete or missing, with all costs to replace the necessary signs to
be borne by the persons responsible for signing the particular
location. Any vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated
handicapped parking area may be towed and stored upon
authorization of a police officer or a parking enforcement officer.
C. Unauthorized operator using handicapped. An operator of a vehicle
bearing a handicapped or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying
a handicapped or severely disabled veteran parking placard shall not
make use of the parking privileges accorded to handicapped persons
and severely disabled veterans under Subsection B above, unless the
operator is handicapped or a severely disabled veteran or unless the
vehicle is being operated for the transportation of a handicapped
person or severely disabled veteran.
D. Handicapped personal mobility devices. Personal conveyance devices,
such as wheelchairs and powered chairs, for the handicapped person or
severely disabled veteran, whether personally or mechanically

powered, are subject to the same stopping, standing and parking
regulations as pedalcycles. Operators of such vehicles are discouraged

(4) In all other respects, pedalcycles stopped, standing or parked
anywhere on a highway shall conform with the provisions of this
article.
A. Larger trucks restricted to deliveries. Trucks of Class Eight or heavier

parking lot or properly signed private parking lot of the Borough of
Slippery Rock for a period longer than necessary to make deliveries.

upon the traveled or untraveled portion of any highway or parking lot in
the Borough of Slippery Rock shall be only temporarily parked for the

vehicles should either notify Borough police about the vehicle, leave a
note on the dash of the vehicle or tie a white cloth on the driver's side
door or other serviceable location.
D. Prohibited vehicles prohibited. Any vehicle, device or animal that is
prohibited from transportation use on the highways, trafficways or
public parking lots of the Borough is prohibited from stopping, standing
or parking in any legal or illegal location on any highway, public parking
lot or properly signed private parking lot in the Borough, including, but
not limited to, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, go-carts, children's toy
vehicles and vehicles that would damage the highway. Vehicles and
equipment used or to be used in construction or in the operation or
maintenance of highways or public utility facilities, which are parked in
a manner which does not interfere with the normal movement of traffic
or damage the surface of the highway, trafficway, public parking lot or
properly signed private parking lot, may be parked in legal parking
locations and shall not be considered to be abandoned. Prohibited
vehicles which are legally or illegally parked may be towed and stored
upon authorization of a police officer or a parking enforcement officer.
E. Abandoned vehicle. No person shall abandon a vehicle upon any
highway or trafficway or upon any public or private property without
the express or implied consent of the owner or other person in lawful
possession or control of the property. Abandoned vehicles may be towed
and stored upon authorization of a police officer, a parking enforcement
officer or the owner or person in charge of the private property where

A. Restrictions by state and Borough Council. The Department on statedesignated
highways and Borough Council on any highway within the
Borough boundaries may, by erection of official traffic control devices,
prohibit, limit or restrict stopping, standing or parking of vehicles on

the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles would unduly interfere
with the free movement of traffic.
B. Penalties for violations. The penalty for violating any part of this article
may be partially or wholly established, modified or abolished upon
resolution or ordinance of the Borough Council of Slippery Rock.
C. Enforcement by Borough. The Borough of Slippery Rock will enforce all
prohibitions of stopping, standing or parking within its boundaries by
either part-time or full-time:
(1) Police officers.

It is a reasonable exercise of the Borough police powers to regulate the
stopping, standing and parking of vehicles on the streets or highways within
the physical boundaries of the Borough. The Borough is authorized by the
Borough Code77 and the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code78 to impose penalties for
violations of its stopping, standing or parking regulations and may impose

shall be set by ordinance between $10 and $50 for each violation.
(2) Parking enforcement officers.
(3) Video cameras.

within the later of either 48 hours of time immediately following such
violation or the next business day following the violation.
B. Penalty for late payment. If the stipulated penalty for violation remains
unpaid after the regular payment period specified in Subsection A, then
an additional penalty for late payment will be levied, and the violation
shall be prosecuted as a summary violation before the Magisterial
District Judge having jurisdiction.
C. Penalty payment required. The penalty for any violation of stopping,
standing or parking must be paid in full. Payment of any other penalties
or charges shall not operate to relieve the obligation of the owner or
operator for payment of penalties imposed under this article.

towed and stored vehicle upon paying the towing and storage costs and
must also pay the penalty for illegally parking the vehicle, as well as any

regulations regarding stormwater management will insure any
property will be free from water damage.
B. Neither this article nor the issuance of a permit hereunder shall create
liability on the part of Slippery Rock Borough or any officer or employee
for any flood or water damage, and the issuance of a building permit, or
any considerations thereunder, may not be relied upon to assess
liability against the Borough, nor may it be asserted as a defense in an
action by a third party for damages caused by the applicant.
A. When a building permit is requested by an applicant and the Zoning
Officer or Borough Engineer clearly determines that the proposed
construction will not affect stormwater runoff characteristics and is
consistent with the applicable provisions of the watershed stormwater
plan adopted by the county and that the proposed construction is not in
a floodplain area, the Zoning Officer may process the application
without further reference to the provisions and requirements of this
article.
B. In the event it is determined that there are surface water
characteristics which must be considered, the surface water
management provisions of this article must be complied with. In
addition, if it is determined that the proposed construction or
development is in a floodplain area, that ordinance must be considered.

concentrated discharge.
(1) The applicant must provide an easement for proposed concentrated
flow across adjacent properties to a drainageway or public right-ofway.
(2) Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
H. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
(with a minimum width of 20 feet and include the one-hundred-year
water surface) shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within the easement, may
be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
J. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
K. Any stormwater management facilities or any facilities that constitute
water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures, etc.) that are regulated by this chapter, that will be located
in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (including wetlands),
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
L. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105
concerning dam safety.

1:262
§ 338-8. Exemptions; modifications.
be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT).
N. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil
conditions and geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
O. Infiltration BMPs must be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
chapter.
P. The design of facilities over karst shall include an evaluation and
implementation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
Q. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers,
or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
the Borough shall permit it on a case-by-case basis.
R. Applicants are encouraged to use low-impact development practices to
reduce the costs of complying with the requirements of this chapter and
the state water quality requirements.
S. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the developer shall notify the
downstream municipality and provide a copy of the SWM plan, if
requested, for review and comment.

compliance with § 338-8A, B and C, may be exempted from various
requirements of this chapter if documentation can be provided that a
downstream man-made water body (i.e., reservoir, lake, or man-made
wetlands) has been designed or modified to address the potential
stormwater flooding impacts of the proposed development.
G. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. The Borough may accept alternative stormwater management
controls under this section, provided that:
(1) The Borough, in consultation with the PADEP (or delegated
authority), determines that meeting the volume control
requirements (See § 338-10.) is not possible or places an undue
hardship on the applicant.
(2) The alternative controls are documented to be acceptable to PADEP
(or delegated authority) for NPDES requirements pertaining to
post-construction stormwater management requirements.
(3) The alternative controls are in compliance with all other sections of
this chapter, including but not limited to §§ 338-7D and 338-8A

watersheds. Municipalities will then consider waivers in accordance
with § 338-7D.
C. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the governing body of
the Borough that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or hardship
as it applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate design may
result in a superior result within the context of the findings and
purposes of this chapter, the governing body of the Borough, upon
obtaining the comments and recommendations of the Borough
Engineer, may grant a waiver or relief so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest is secured, provided that such waiver will
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter.
D. The applicant shall submit all requests for waivers in writing and shall
include such requests as a part of the plan review and approval process.
The applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of
this chapter that are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief that is
necessary. The applicant shall state how the requested waiver and how
the applicant's proposal shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent or purpose and general principles of this
chapter.
E. The Borough shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests.
F. The Borough may charge a fee for each waiver request, which shall be
used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing the waiver request.

1:267
§ 338-10. Volume controls.
(17) That the receiving streams and/or water bodies will not be
adversely impacted in flood-carrying capacity, aquatic habitat,
channel stability and erosion and sedimentation.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix C of this chapter95 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
95.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 338-9 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-10
1:268
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases, at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the Borough shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either Subsection B(1) or (2) of this section, the
following procedure shall be used:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations.
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative
shall identify depth to seasonal high-water tables and
depth to bedrock, and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction and rate
of subsurface water movement.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed
development:

practices shall be determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, most current
version.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Butler County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms.
B. Lands contained within Butler County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) The post-development peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the following watersheds
(see appendixes for release rate map96):
(a) Connoquenessing Creek Watershed.
A. Sensitive areas and water quality sensitive developments as defined
below which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
(1) "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. Municipalities may update the
sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as
required.
(2) "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land development project
that has a high potential to endanger local water quality and could
potentially threaten groundwater reservoirs. The Municipal

a case-by-case basis. The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant
source list shall be used as a guide in these determinations.
Industrial manufacturing site and hazardous material storage
areas must provide NPDES SIC codes.
B. Performance standards.
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.
(2) Stormwater hotspots may be required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of intent as
required under the provisions of the EPA Industrial Stormwater
NPDES Permit Requirements.
(3) Stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable pretreatment BMP
prior to volume control and/or rate control BMPs. Acceptable
pretreatment BMPs for these developments include those based on
filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such as
coagulation.
A. The applicant shall meet requirements as contained in 25 Pa. Code
Chapters 92a and 102, as required and applicable, as follows:97

§ 338-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-15
1:275
§ 338-15. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering
plans and performance capabilities and supporting site-specific
soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources
may be accepted at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer (a
preapplication meeting is suggested).
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Borough shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the Borough and prior approval are required
§ 338-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-15
1:276
before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with stormwater
management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway
without approval from the Borough or PennDOT.
(2) The top, or toe, of any slope shall be located a minimum of 10 feet
from any property line.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any stormwater holding
facility shall be 25 feet. The lowest floor elevation of any structure
constructed immediately adjacent to a detention basin or other
stormwater facility shall be a minimum of two feet above the onehundred-
year water surface elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is defined,
bottom elevations must be greater than existing ground elevations
50 feet from top of stream bank in the facility's vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-yearfloodplain
elevation must be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodway is not
designated, or no other evidence is provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains need not
be accounted for in volume or rate control calculations.
§ 338-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-15
1:277
(7) Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(8) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 3:1 and may be
further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(9) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 3:1.
(10) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
2% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(11) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
(12) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(13) Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated, or piped, to an
acceptable point.
(14) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(a) Minimal-maintenance, saturation-tolerant vegetation must be
provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(15) A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of the Borough,
for any stormwater management facility. The fence shall be a
minimum of four feet high and of a material acceptable to the
Borough. A gate with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for maintenance access.
(16) Principal outlet structures. The primary outlet structure shall be
designed to pass all design storms (up to and including the onehundred-
year event) without discharging through the emergency

material approved by the Municipal Engineer. When approved
for use, all metal risers shall:
§ 338-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-15
1:278
[1] Be suitably coated to prevent corrosion.
[2] Have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be sufficient weight to prevent
flotation of the riser.

structure stages for all orifices.
(c) Provide outlet aprons and shall extend to the toe of the basin
slope at a minimum.
(17) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year post-development peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure.
(b) Avoid locating on fill areas, whenever possible.
(c) The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the
one-hundred-year post-development flow, with a blocked
primary outlet structure.
[1] Synthetic liners or riprap may be used, and calculations
sufficient to support proposed armor must be provided. An
earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the
spillway and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet
past the toe of slope.
(d) Municipal Engineer may require the use of additional
protection when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities
might exceed NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow) without structural failure or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
§ 338-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-15
1:279
(18) Stormwater management basins. Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be:
[1] For embankments up to four feet, width shall be at least six

[2] For embankments between four and six feet, width shall be
at least eight feet;
[3] For embankments over six feet, width shall be at least 10
feet.
(c) A ten-foot-wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.
(d) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. Soils used shall
be tested to determine its density analysis per ASTM 698. The
embankments will be constructed in a maximum of six-inch
lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density at least 98%
of its maximum dry density. Each layer of compacted fill shall
be tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM
3017. One test per 50 cubic yards of material placed (at least
one per layer) shall be performed by an independent testing
agency.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Antiseep collars, or a PADEP-approved alternative, must be
provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the
methodology contained in the latest edition of the PADEP E&S
Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be used in
accordance with the requirements for permanent antiseep
collars.
(19) Construction of stormwater management facilities:
(a) Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances which
they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted
in the narrative and on the plan.
§ 338-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-15
1:280
(b) Basins that include water quality or recharge components shall
have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(c) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times, with copies being forwarded to
the Municipal Engineer upon request.
(d) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
(20) Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
the Borough for BMPs that retain or detain water but are of a much
smaller scale than traditional stormwater management facilities.
C. Stormwater-carrying facilities.
(1) All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and
other stormwater-carrying facilities that service drainage areas
within the site must be able to convey post-development runoff
from the ten-year design storm.

(c) Inlets, manholes, pipes, and culverts shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications set forth in PennDOT's
Publication 408, and as detailed in PennDOT's Publication
72M, Standards for Roadway Construction (RC), or other detail
approved by the Municipal Engineer. All material and
construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe trenches, etc.)
must be shown on the SWM site plan and a note added that all
construction must be in accordance with PennDOT's
Publication 408 and PennDOT's Publication 72M, latest

§ 338-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-15
1:281
frames, concrete top units, and grade adjustment rings shall be
set in a bed of full mortar according to Publication 408.
(d) A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in
all roadway systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in the Borough. Pipes shall be designed to provide
a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second when flowing full,

§ 338-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-15
1:283
§ 338-16. Calculation methodology.
(d) Swales shall be designed for stability using velocity or shear
criteria. Velocity criteria may be used for channels with less
than 10% slope. Shear criteria may be used for all swales.
Documentation must be provided to support velocity and/or
shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear
stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor for the
purpose of designing swale erosion protection:

[3] When swale bend is 90° or greater: 2.50.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Other methods shall be selected by the design professional based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by the Municipal Engineer.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
Return Interval
(years)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.02
2 2.41
10 3.38
25 4.00
50 4.50
§ 338-15 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-16
1:284
Return Interval
(years)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
100 5.03
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational Method: not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS TR-20, WinTR-20, WinTR-55, HEC-HMS: no
watershed size limitations
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS Antecedent Runoff Condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table D-1 (Appendix D).99
§ 338-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-16
1:285
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table D-2 (Appendix D). Curve
numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious area conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year, fiftyyear,
and one-hundred-year hydrographs through the facility using
the Storage Indication Method or Modified Puls Method. The
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Municipal
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment: NRCS Lag Equation:
Time of concentration = Tc = [(Tlog/0.6) * 60] (minutes)
99.Editor's Note: Appendix D is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 338-16 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 338-16
1:286
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by
S = [(1,000/CN) -10]
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
(b) Post-development: commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area): NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(c) Post-development: residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS Log
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater that the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot be assumed
for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the post-
§ 338-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-16
1:287
§ 338-17. Approval of SWM site plan required.

§ 343-5. Activities requiring issuance of permit.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to make any tunnel, opening
or excavation of any kind in or under the surface of any street without
first securing a permit from the Borough Administrator or his or her

person or entity maintaining pipes, lines or other underground facilities
103. Editors Note: This ordinance also superseded former Article II, Openings and
Excavations, adopted 2-1-2005 by Ord. No. 620 (Ch. 21, Part 3, of the 1983 Code).
§ 343-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 343-5
1:307
§ 343-6. Work to be done pursuant to permit.
No person or entity to whom a permit has been granted shall perform
any of the work authorized by such permit in any amount greater than
that specified in the permit, except that where the permittee desires to
perform additional work not in excess of an amount greater than 10% of
the amount specified in the permit, the permittee may apply to the Borough
Administrator or his or her designee for an amended permit to authorize
the additional work. If the additional work desired to be performed by the
permittee exceeds 10% of the amount specified in the original permit, an
application for a new permit shall be made. Any deposit or bond posted
in connection with the original permit shall be deemed to cover any such
additional work as may be added pursuant to the issuance of an amended
permit within the limit specified herein.
§ 343-7. Time for commencement of work.
Work for which a permit has been issued shall commence within 30 days
after the issuance of the permit therefor. If not so commenced, the permit
shall be terminated automatically unless the permittee applies for an
extension of time within which to commence work. If such an extension is
granted, the original permit shall remain in force for the period of time
specified in the extension. Permits which terminate because of failure to
commence work within 30 days after issuance or within any extension of
time granted hereunder may be renewed only upon the payment of an
additional permit fee as originally required.
§ 343-8. Time limit.
Every permit shall expire at the end of the period of time which shall be
set out in the permit. If the permittee shall be unable to complete the work
within the specified time, he or she shall, prior to expiration of the permit,
present, in writing, to the Borough Administrator or his or her designee a
in or under the surface of any street may proceed with an opening
without a permit when emergency circumstances demand the work to
be done immediately, provided that the permit could not reasonably
and practically have been obtained beforehand. In such cases where
emergency openings are necessary, however, the municipality shall be
notified prior to such openings by:
(1) Fax notification.
(2) Telephone notification.
(3) PA One Call.
B. The person or entity shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first
regular business day on which the office of the Borough Administrator
or his or her designee is open for business, and said permit shall be
retroactive to the date when the work was begun.

1:308
request for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons for the
requested extension. If the Borough Administrator or his or her designee
finds that the failure to complete the work under the permit within the
time specified therein was due to circumstances reasonably beyond the
control of the permittee and that an extension of time to complete the work
under the permit is necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the
permittee may be granted additional time for the completion of the work.
§ 343-9. State and county roads.
The provisions of this article shall not be applicable in those instances
where the street or highway is maintained by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or by Butler County; provided, however, that any person or
entity applying for a permit to do work within the right-of-way of a street
or highway maintained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by Butler
County which would otherwise require a permit under the terms of this
article shall notify the Borough Administrator or his or her designee at the
time that said application is made and at the time that the work under any
permit issued pursuant to said application is begun, so that proper safety
precautions may be taken by the municipality during the continuation of
said work.
§ 343-10. Revocation of permit.
A. Any permit may be revoked by the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee after notice to the permittee for:
(1) Violation of any condition of the permit or any provision of this
article.
(2) Violation of any other applicable provision of the Municipal Code or
any law relating to the work.
(3) The creation of any condition or the doing of any act constituting or
creating a nuisance or endangering the life or property of others.
B. The permittee shall be granted a period of three business days from the
date of the notice to correct the violation and to proceed with the
diligent prosecution of the work authorized by the permit before said
permit is revoked.
C. Written notice of any such violation or condition shall be served upon
the permittee or his or her agent engaged in the work. The notice shall
contain a brief statement of the reasons for revoking the permit. Notice
may be given either by personal delivery thereof to the person or entity
to be notified or by certified or registered United States mail addressed
to the person or entity to be notified.
D. When any permit has been revoked and the work authorized by the
permit has not been completed, the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee shall do or cause to be done such work as may be necessary to
restore the street or part thereof to as good a condition as before the
§ 343-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 343-10
1:309
§ 343-11. Requirements and specifications.
opening was made. All expenses thereby incurred by the municipality
shall be recovered from the deposit or bond the permittee has made or
filed with the municipality.
A. No opening or excavation in any street shall extend beyond the center
line of the street before being backfilled and the surface of the street
temporarily restored.
B. No more than 250 feet measured longitudinally shall be opened in any
street at any one time, except by special permission of the Borough
Administrator or his or her designee.
C. All utility facilities shall be exposed sufficiently, or their definite location
shall be determined ahead of trench excavation work to avoid damage
to those facilities and to permit their relocation, if necessary.
D. Pipe drains, pipe culverts or other facilities encountered shall be
protected by the permittee and if damaged, they must be repaired inkind
with inspection by the Borough Engineer.
E. Any person whose facilities are damaged or caused to be relocated by
the permittee shall notify the permittee and the municipality of such
damage and thereafter may make the necessary repairs or relocation
and file a claim against the permittee with the municipality for the cost
of such repairs or relocation. Public utility companies concerned shall
be notified by the Borough in sufficient time to determine the validity of
the damage or relocation claims. The cost of such repair work or
relocation work may be withheld by the Borough Administrator or his or
her designee from the deposit pending determination of liability for the
damage.
F. Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the
purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property
subdivision or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey
benchmark within the municipality shall not be removed or disturbed or
caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission to do so is first
obtained, in writing, from the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee. Permission shall be granted only upon the condition that the
permittee shall pay all expenses incident to the proper replacement of
the monument.
G. When work performed by the permittee interferes with the established
drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee
to provide proper drainage.
H. When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused to flow,
roll or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause removal of the
same from the street within eight hours after deposit to permit safe flow
of traffic. In the event that the earth, gravel or other excavated material
so deposited is not removed as specified, the Borough Administrator or
§ 343-10 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 343-11
1:310
his or her designee shall cause such removal, and the cost incurred
shall be paid by the permittee or deducted from his or her deposit.
I. Every permittee shall place around the project such barriers,
barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be
determined by the Borough Administrator or his or her designee to be
necessary for the protection of the public. Additional safety
requirements may be prescribed by the Borough Administrator or his or
her designee and, where applicable, shall be in conformance with the
requirements set forth in 67 Pa. Code Chapter 212, dealing with work
zone traffic control. Copies of the publication shall be made available in
the office of the Borough Administrator or his or her designee for
inspection by the public.
(1) Whenever any permittee fails to provide or maintain the required
safety devices, such devices shall be installed and maintained by
the municipality. The amount of the cost incurred shall be paid by
the permittee or deducted from his or her deposit.
(2) No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or
extinguish any barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed
or posted in accordance with the provisions of this section.
J. Access to private driveways shall be provided except during working
hours when construction operations prohibit provision of such access.
Free access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
K. Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench
and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible
to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate dirt or
dust nuisance, the Borough Administrator or his or her designee may
require the permittee to provide toe boards or bins; and if the
excavated area is muddy and causes inconvenience to pedestrians,
temporary wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee as
directed by the Borough Administrator or his or her designee. If the
street is not wide enough to hold the excavated material without using
part of the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee shall keep a passageway at
least 1/2 the sidewalk width open along such sidewalk line.
L. Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the
permittee obtains written consent from the Borough Administrator or
his or her designee to do the work at an earlier or later hour. Such
permission shall be granted only in the case of an emergency or in the
event that the work authorized by the pem1it is to be performed in
traffic-congested areas.
M. In granting any permit, the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee may attach such other conditions thereto as may be
reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or private property
or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner
§ 343-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 343-11
1:311
§ 343-11.1. Restoration.
hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely to create a nuisance.
Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed.
(2) Restrictions as to the size, weight and type of equipment.
(3) Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported.
(4) Designation of the place and manner of disposal of excavated
materials.
(5) Requirements as to the laying of dust, the cleaning of streets, the
prevention of noise and other results offensive or injurious to the
neighborhood, the general public or any portion thereof.
(6) Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.
N. Hydra-hammer, headache ball. The use of mechanical devices for the
breaking of pavement, such as a hydra-han1mer, headache ball, etc.,
will be permitted only under special written permission of the Borough
Administrator or his or her designee.
A. All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be made properly
and backfilled properly by the permittee according to Slippery Rock
Borough specifications. The permittee shall place a temporary surface
on the pavement cut, opening or excavation in accordance with
municipal specifications. If the permittee has been granted permission
to restore the street surface, but weather conditions are such as to
prevent the completion of permanent restoration of the street surface
at the time backfilling is completed, the permittee shall install a
temporary surface in accordance with municipal specifications until
such time as weather conditions will permit permanent restoration of
the street surface.
B. The Borough Administrator or his or her designee shall be notified by
the permittee during the forty-eight-hour periods preceding the
beginnings of backfilling and restoration and the approximate time
each will be begun.
C. No backfilling or restoration shall be accomplished unless or until the
Borough Administrator or his or her designee is present or permission
has been granted for backfilling or restoration after inspection by the
Borough Administrator or his or her designee.
D. The work of final restoration, including both paving surface and paving
base, shall be performed under the supervision of the Borough
Administrator or his or her designee; provided, however, that upon a
public utility company's application for permission to perform the work
of restoration, the municipality may grant permission to such public
§ 343-11 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 343-11.1
1:312
utility company to perform the work of restoration. In those cases,
where such permission is granted, the work of restoration, including
both paving surface and paving base, shall be performed by the
permittee according to Slippery Rock Borough specifications and shall
be subject to inspection by the municipality.
E. If the Borough Administrator or his or her designee finds that paving
surfaces adjacent to the street openings may be damaged where
trenches are made parallel to the street or where a number of cross
trenches are laid in proximity to one another or where the equipment
used may cause such damage, he or she may require negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching
of such street if the total area of the proposed patch damaged area
exceeds 25% of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or
between concrete gutter edges. Such negotiations shall be carried on
and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
F. On any improved street, the persons performing the restoration shall be
required to rotomill the entire cartway 30 feet before and after the
utility patch and complete a bituminous overlay with 1.5 inches of 9.5
mm bituminous wearing course.
G. After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted with due diligence. Unless the provisions of
Subsection A of this section apply, the permittee is required to complete
permanent restoration of the street surface in accordance with
municipal specifications within seven days after repairs and/or
installation are completed. Furthermore, the permittee shall be
required to install and maintain a temporary surface in accordance with
municipal specifications during:
(1) The period between the completion of repairs and/or installation
and the commencement of final restoration; and
(2) The periods during the actual work when workers do not require
access to the excavation.
H. Inspections of all work authorized by a permit shall be made by the
Borough Administrator or his or her designee at such times and in such
manner as required to assure compliance with provisions of this article.
If the nature of the work to be performed under any permit is such as to
require the services of a full-time inspector, the Borough Administrator
or his or her designee shall provide for the services of such an
inspector.
I. All inspection costs shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs shall be
based upon a schedule of charges on file in the office of the Borough
Engineer.
J. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of a
permit, the permittee shall notify the Borough Administrator or his or
her designee, in writing. A certificate of final inspection shall be issued
§ 343-11.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 343-11.1
1:313
§ 343-11.2. Deposit.
by the Borough Administrator or his or her designee to each permittee
no sooner than one year and not later than 18 months after the
permanent restoration of the excavation has been made, provided that
the work authorized by the permit has been performed according to
municipal specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the
Borough Administrator or his or her designee shall make a final
inspection of the restoration to determine whether municipal
specifications have been adhered to.
K. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of two years
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration and the
permittee fails to make such correction after notification, any expense
incurred by the municipality in correcting such settlement shall be paid
by the permittee or recovered from his or her bond, unless the
permittee submits proof satisfactory to the Borough Engineer that the
settlement was not due to defective backfilling.
A. Computation of deposit. The Borough Administrator or his or her
designee, upon receipt of a properly completed application, shall
determine the amount of the deposit to be made by the permittee in
accordance with the fee schedule; provided, however, that the minimum
deposit required shall not be less than $50. The deposit shall be paid at
the time the permit is issued, and the deposit shall be used to reimburse
the municipality for the cost of any work and/or materials furnished by
it in connection with work authorized by the permit, to cover the cost of
all necessary inspections of said work or any other expenses incurred
by the municipality in carrying out the provisions of this article. In the
case of a public utility company, the requirement of such deposit may be
waived if such public utility company files its corporate bond with the
municipality.
B. Form of deposit. The deposit may be either in the form of a certified,
treasurer's or cashier's check or in lawful money of the United States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay all costs,
the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the municipality an amount
equal to the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to pay such
deficiency, the municipality may institute an action to recover the same
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in
full, no additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.
D. Yearly deposit. Whenever any public utility company shall anticipate
applying for permits for more than one street opening or excavation per
calendar year and does not elect to file a corporate bond as
hereinbefore provided, such public utility company may post one
deposit in an amount and form as herein before provided for the
calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of deposits which would
otherwise be required for the anticipated permits.
§ 343-11.1 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 343-11.2
1:314
§ 343-11.3. Performance bond.
E. Deposit and cost schedules. The Borough Administrator or his or her
designee shall establish a schedule of charges for inspections, labor,
materials and other such expenses as may be incurred by the
municipality in carrying out the provisions of this article. This schedule
shall be established by the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee in accordance with the reasonably anticipated costs to be
incurred by the municipality in making such inspections, including
reasonable administrative and overhead expenses, and in accordance
with the currently prevailing costs in the area for any labor and
materials which may be provided by the municipality. The Borough
Administrator or his or her designee shall revise said schedule from
time to time to reflect any increase or decrease in the costs used to
establish said charges. The schedule shall be open to public inspection
in the office of the Borough Administrator or his or her designee upon
request.
F. Decision on costs. The decision of the Borough Administrator or his or
her designee as to the cost of any work done or repairs made by a
permittee under his or her direction, pursuant to the provisions of this
article, shall be final and conclusive as to such cost.
G. Refund of deposit. Upon notification by the permittee that all work
authorized by the permit has been completed and after restoration of
the opening, the Borough Administrator or his or her designee shall
refund to the permittee his or her deposit, less all costs incurred by the
municipality in connection with said permit. In no event shall the permit
fee be refunded.
A. A performance bond is required in those instances when the
municipality does not perform the restoration work. In those instances,
where the applicant has received or intends to apply for permission to
perform the work of restoration of the street surface, each such
applicant or permittee, upon receipt of a permit, shall provide the
municipality with an acceptable corporate surety bond to guarantee
faithful performance of the work authorized by a permit granted
pursuant to this article. The amount of the bond shall be 110% of the
estimated cost of restoring the street opening. The term of the bond
shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and shall terminate upon
the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final inspection from the
Borough Engineer. If the permittee anticipates requesting more than
one permit per year, as required by this article, he or she may furnish
one continuing corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful
performance in such amount as the Borough Administrator or his or her
designee deems necessary. The amount of such bond shall be in relation
to the cost of restoring pavement cuts to be made by the permittee
throughout the year. In the case of a public utility company, its
corporate bond, in a form satisfactory to the Solicitor, may be accepted
in lieu of the corporate surety bond required by this section.
§ 343-11.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 343-11.3
1:315
§ 343-11.4. Liability insurance.
Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall provide the municipality
with an acceptable certificate of insurance indicating that he or she is
insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as against
claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the performance
of the work, whether such performance is by himself or herself, his or her
subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him or her. Such
insurance shall cover collapse, explosive hazards and underground work
by equipment on the street and shall include protection against liability
arising from completed operations. The amount of the insurance shall be
prescribed by the Borough Administrator or his or her designee in
accordance with the nature of the risk involved; provided, however, that
the liability insurance for bodily injury shall be in an amount no less than
$250,000 for each person and $500,000 for each accident, and for property
damages, in an amount no less than $100,000, with an aggregate of
$300,000 for all accidents. Public utility companies and authorities may be
relieved of the obligation of submitting such a certificate if they submit
satisfactory evidence that they are insured in accordance with the
requirements of this article or have adequate provision for self-insurance.
Public utility companies may file an annual certificate of insurance in lieu of
individual certificates for each permit.
§ 343-11.5. Violations and penalties.
Any person or entity who shall violate any provision of this article shall,
upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600;
and in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days.
Every day that a violation of this article continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
B. Default in performance. Whenever the Borough Administrator or his or
her designee shall find that a default has occurred in the performance
of any term or condition of the permit, written notice thereof shall be
given to the principal and to the surety on the bond. Such notice shall
state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of
time deemed by the Borough Administrator or his or her designee to be
reasonably necessary for the completion of such work.
C. Completion of work. After receipt of such notice, the surety must,
within the time therein specified, either cause the required work to be
performed or, failing therein, indemnify the municipality for the cost of
doing the work as set forth in the notice.

by vehicular traffic or pedestrians, whether public or private.
STREET CLASSIFICATIONS  The following street classifications shall
apply to streets in the Borough of Slippery Rock and shall be applied as
defined in the "Comprehensive Plan for the Borough of Slippery Rock,
Butler County, Pennsylvania":
ARTERIAL  Arterials accommodate intercommunity traffic flow and
afford connections to other communities or secondary regional traffic
generators, with direct access to adjoining property being a secondary
function. The average length of trip of such highway normally exceeds
three miles.
A.
COLLECTOR  These roads serve to funnel traffic onto arterials and
to provide linkage on an intercommunity basis. Providing access to
B.

§ 350-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-8
1:331
STREET, PRIVATE  A street, including the entire private right-of-way,
which is privately owned and maintained through private agreement and
which is intended for private use. A private street which provides access
to three or more lots or parcels which do not have access to a public
street shall be considered as access to a public street. (See also "driveway,
private," "driveway, common" and "driveway, multi.") Design standards for
private streets shall comply with the requirements of Article V herein, and
improvements shall comply with the standards of Article VI herein. Section
350-64, Performance requirements, § 350-65, Performance guarantees, and
§ 350-66, Release from improvement bond, shall apply to all developments
proposing to install a private street.
STREET, PUBLIC  A street, including the entire public right-of-way, which
has been dedicated to and accepted by the Borough or which has been
devoted to public use by legal mapping, use or other means.
STRUCTURE  Any man-made object having an ascertainable stationary
location on or in land or water, whether or not affixed to the land.
SUBDIVIDER  See "developer."
SUBDIVISION  The division or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land
by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions
of land, including changes in existing lot lines, for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs
or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT 
properties abutting a collector street is likewise a secondary function.
The primary function of a collector street is to accept the traffic
generated on local streets with which they may be interlinked.
LOCAL  Such roadways are intended primarily to serve properties
fronting on their right-of-way. These roads generally do not carry major
traffic volumes since their function is to serve that traffic generated
from the residential properties.
C.
Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure either:
(1) Before the improvement or repair is started; or
If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
(2)
A.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term
does not, however, include either:
B.
§ 350-8 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 350-8
1:332

Engineer, at least 90% (based on the cost of the required improvements for
which financial security was posted pursuant to § 350-64 of this chapter)
of those improvements required as a condition for final approval have been
completed in accordance with the approved plan, so that the project will be
able to be used, occupied or operated for its intended use.
TOPOGRAPHIC MAP  A map showing ground elevations by contour lines
and the location of important, natural and man-made features.
WATERCOURSE  The word "watercourse" shall include all existing
channels, creeks, ditches, drains, dry runs, springs and streams; also, all
proposed channels, ditches, drains and drainage facilities.
WETLANDS  Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and
that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions as defined and
regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
United States Army Corps of Engineers (COE), and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
ZONING OFFICER  The administrative officer designated to administer
Chapter 375, Zoning, and issue zoning and building permits.
Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

so as to discourage through traffic, but provisions for street
connections into and from adjacent areas will be generally required.
D. Where a subdivision plat abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Commission and Borough Council may
require local access streets, reverse frontage lots, or such other
treatment which will provide protection for abutting properties,
reduction in the number of intersections with arterial streets, and
separation of local and through traffic.
E. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of this chapter and where, in addition,
satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street
can be secured.

resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, adequate
street right-of-way to permit further resubdivision shall be provided as
necessary.
I. Reserve strips, restricting or controlling access to adjacent streets or
properties, shall be prohibited.

(3) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in
conformation with above standards may be required.
(4) Where anticipated traffic flows and vehicle size warrants additional
widths, increases in base material and cartway widths will be
established by the Planning Commission and the Borough
Engineer.
A. Curbs, where required, shall be installed by the subdivider along the
streets or where deemed necessary for public safety as determined by
the Borough Council. The curbs shall be of the type and material as
specified and approved by the Borough Council. All curbs at
intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius of 25 feet for local

§ 350-65. Performance guarantees.
A. Before approving any subdivision plan, the Borough Council shall
require a written agreement that necessary grading, paving and street
improvements, sidewalks, streetlights, fire hydrants, water mains and
sanitary sewers, as may be required by the Borough, shall be installed
by the subdivider in strict accordance with the design standards and
specifications of the Borough, within a specified time period. Such
agreement shall be prepared by the Borough Solicitor at the expense of
the developer.
B. When requested by the developer in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining satisfactory financial security. The final plat shall
not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement
is executed. If within 90 days, unless written extension is granted by the
Borough Council, the financial improvement agreement is not executed,
then the resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire.
A. The Borough Council shall insure, through receipt of certificates of
compliance submitted and attested by the Borough Engineer, that
required improvements have been installed according to the
specifications of the final plat, or alternately require the posting of
adequate surety to cover the cost for such improvements. The Borough
Council shall specify one of the following alternatives for guaranteeing
compliance with the requirements of this section for the developer
requesting final approval of a plat. The decision of which alternative
shall be required is that of the Borough Council, and final approval of a
plat shall not be granted until the surety required is fully provided.
B. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the subdivider's scheduled date of
completion. The amount estimated shall be prepared by a licensed
professional engineer for submittal to the Borough by the applicant or
subdivider. If the amount of the estimated financial security is contested
by the Borough Engineer, a third licensed professional engineer chosen
mutually by the applicant or subdivider and the Borough shall estimate
the amount of financial security necessary, which estimate shall be
presumed fair and reasonable. Fees for the services of the third
engineer shall be paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or
subdivider.
(1) Completion of improvements prior to final approval. Prior to final
plat approval, the subdivider shall complete, in a manner
§ 350-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-65
1:359
satisfactory to the Borough Council and the Borough Engineer,
all improvements required in these regulations specified in the
final subdivision plat and as approved by the Borough Council
and shall dedicate same to the Borough in accordance with these
regulations. Final plat approval shall not be granted until the
dedication of said improvements has been accepted by the Borough
Council.
(2) Guarantee of future performance. In lieu of requiring the
completion of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the
Borough may, at its discretion, enter into a contract with the
subdivider whereby the subdivider shall guarantee to complete all
improvements required by this chapter or otherwise specified by
the Borough Council in a manner satisfactory to the Borough
Council. To secure this contract, the subdivider shall provide,
subject to the approval of the Borough Council, one of the following
guarantees:
(a) Surety bond. The subdivider shall obtain a security bond from a
surety bonding company authorized to do business in the State
of Pennsylvania. The bond shall be payable to the Borough and
shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the entire cost, as
estimated by the Borough Engineer, as herein provided, for the
installation of all improvements. The duration of the bond shall
be until such time as the improvements are accepted by the
Borough in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(b) Escrow account. The subdivider shall deposit cash, or other
instruments readily convertible into cash at face value, either
with the Borough or in escrow with a bank. The form of any
instruments other than cash, and, in the case of an escrow
account, the bank with which the funds are to be deposited,
shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Solicitor. The
amount of the deposit shall be at least equal to the cost, as
estimated by the Borough Engineer, of installing all required
improvements, plus 10%. In case of an escrow account, the
subdivider shall file with the Borough Council an agreement
between the financial bank and himself guaranteeing the
following:
[1] That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in trust
until released by the Borough Council and may not be used
or pledged by the subdivider as security in any other
matter during the period; and
[2] That, in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider
to complete said improvements, the bank shall
immediately make the funds in said account available to
the Borough for use in the completion of those
improvements.

§ 350-66. Release from improvement bond.
(c) Irrevocable letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit in an
amount equal to the cost of all required improvements, as
estimated by the Borough Engineer, plus 10%, shall be posted
naming the Borough Council as beneficiaries. The financial
institution which provides the irrevocable letter of credit shall
be first approved by the Borough Council. Failure on the part of
the subdivider to complete said improvements shall cause the
funds posted as an irrevocable letter of credit to be more
available to the Borough upon written notice of a claim against
said funds.
A. Procedure.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the required
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
required improvements and shall send a copy to the Borough
Engineer.
(2) The Borough Council shall, within 10 days after receipt of such
notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall,
thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Borough Council, and
shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified
or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30
days after receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from the Borough Council; said report shall be
detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements
or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be rejected by
the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of
reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
(3) The Borough Council shall notify the developer, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, within 15 days of receipt of the
engineer's report of the action of said Borough Council with
relation thereto.
(4) If any portion of the required improvements shall not be approved
or shall be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same, and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
(5) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
subdivider's or developer's right to contest or question, by legal
proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Borough
Council or the Borough Engineer.
§ 350-65 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-66
1:361
(6) The Borough may prescribe that the applicant shall reimburse the
Borough for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred in
connection with the inspection of improvements. The applicant
shall not be required to reimburse the Borough Council for any
inspection which is duplicative of inspections conducted by other
governmental agencies or public utilities. The burden of proving
that any inspection is duplicative shall be upon the objecting
applicant. Such reimbursement shall be based upon a schedule
established by ordinance or resolution. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees
charged by the Borough's professional consultant for work
performed for similar services in the community, but in no event
shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional
consultant to the Borough for comparable services when fees are
not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.118
(a) The Borough Council shall submit to the applicant an itemized
bill showing the work performed in connection with the
inspection of improvements performed, identifying the person
performing the services and the time and date spent for each
task. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any
such expense in connection with the inspection of
improvements, the applicant shall, no later than 100 days after
the date of transmittal of a bill for inspection services, notify
the Borough and the Borough's professional consultant that
such inspection expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary and shall explain the basis of their objections to
the fees charged, in which case the Borough shall not delay or
disapprove a request for release of financial security, a
subdivision or land development application or any approval or
permit related to development due to the applicant's dispute of
inspection expenses. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill
within 100 days shall be a waiver of the applicant's right to
arbitration of that bill under this section.
(b) Subsequent to the final release of financial security for
completion of improvements for a subdivision or land
development or any phase thereof, the professional consultant
shall submit to the Borough Council a bill for inspection
services, specifically designated as a final bill, which the
Borough Council shall submit to the applicant. The final bill
shall include inspection fees incurred through the release of
financial security.
(c) If the professional consultant and the applicant cannot agree
on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the applicant shall have the right, within 100
days of the transmittal of the final bill or supplement to the
118. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 350-66 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 350-66
1:362
final bill to the applicant, to request the appointment of
another professional consultant to serve as an arbitrator. The
applicant and professional consultant whose fees are being
challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint another
professional consultant to review any bills the applicant has
disputed and which remain unresolved and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary. The arbitrator shall be of the same profession
as the professional consultant whose fees are being
challenged.
(d) The arbitrator so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the arbitrator in his or her sole
opinion deems necessary and shall render a decision no later
than 50 days after the date of appointment. Based on the
decision of the arbitrator, the applicant or the professional
consultant whose fees were challenged shall be required to pay
any amounts necessary to implement the decision within 60
days. In the event the Borough has paid the professional
consultant an amount in excess of the amount determined to be
reasonable and necessary, the professional consultant shall
within 60 days reimburse the excess payment.
(e) In the event that the Borough's professional consultant and
applicant cannot agree upon the arbitrator to be appointed
within 20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator,
then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the
Borough is located (or, if at the time there be no President
Judge, then the senior active Judge then sitting) shall appoint
such arbitrator, who, in that case, shall be neither the
Borough's professional consultant nor any professional
consultant who has been retained by, or performed services for,
the Borough or the applicant within the preceding five years.

date, then the service connection charge shall be $100 per unit for
the second through 50 units, $75 per unit for the next 20 units and
$35 per unit for each unit over 25 units. In this instance, a recordable
legal agreement shall be executed setting forth the proper conditions
of providing service.
C. In any event, the minimum water service connection charge shall be
$650.
A. Buildings or properties served by a single service line but used for

according to § 368-14 above. Said agreement shall be recorded and run with
the property.
§ 368-16. Multiunit buildings with independent water supply.
For all properties having multiple units connected to the sanitary sewer,
which units are not connected to said water facilities of the Borough but

metered at the current rates in the following manner:
§ 368-17. Metering mobile home parks.
All owners of mobile home parks connected to the municipal water system
and sanitary sewer system shall have one meter or the option described
under § 368-12 above and shall be metered at the current rates in the
following manner if the individually metered option is not chosen:
A. The total meter reading in gallons to be divided by the number of
occupied units in the multiunit, thereby establishing the average
reading in gallons per unit. This average reading shall be applied to the
current schedule of rates for water and sewer service thereof
establishing a cost per unit, but not less than the current minimum per
occupied unit per month, whichever is greater. This cost in turn shall be
multiplied by the number of occupied units in the multiunit as
established above, thus totaling the bill to be rendered to the owner of
the property.
A. The total meter reading in gallons is to be divided by the number of
units in the multiunit building, thereby establishing the average
reading in gallons per unit. This average reading shall be applied to the
current minimum for sewer service only per occupied unit per month
and be multiplied by the number of occupied units in the multiunit
building to be rendered to the owner of the property. The water meter is
to be furnished and installed by the Borough, but the costs for
installation and maintenance of said meter shall be at the property
owner's expense.
A. The total reading in gallons to be divided by the number of occupied
mobile homes in the park as determined by the Borough official and
certified by the mobile home park manager during the monthly reading
of the meter, thereby establishing the average reading in gallons per

occupied mobile home. This average reading shall be applied to the
current schedule of rates for water and sewer service, thereby
establishing a cost per mobile home, but not less than the current
minimum per mobile home per month, whichever is greater. The mobile
home park operator shall certify to the owner the number of units in
the park monthly. The cost, in turn, shall be multiplied by the number of
mobile homes as established above, thus totaling the bill to be rendered
to the owner of the mobile home park.

§ 368-22. Meter failure.
If a meter fails to register or otherwise becomes out of order, such meter
shall be repaired or replaced by the Borough, and the current bill shall
be estimated and determined by the average amount of water used in a
previous corresponding period. No deduction from any water bill shall be
allowed on account of leakage.

accordingly. If such test shows a deviation of less than 4%, his account shall
be charged a service charge of $30.
§ 368-25. Bypassing meter.
No customer or property owner shall take, allow or receive, or permit to
be taken or received, any water from the water system into a building,
except that such water shall have passed through and been registered by

dwelling unit shall be four inches. If the Borough deems it necessary
due to the location of the connection, it can require, at the owner's
expense, the installation of a backwater valve to protect the owner.
A. The Borough reserves the right to impose surcharges for collection and
treatment of trade, industrial and commercial wastes should such
wastes be acceptable to the Borough. Further, the Borough can require
pretreatment of the waste prior to discharge into the Borough system
or, if completely incompatible, provide its own treatment facilities with
the discharge to a natural waterway, all in accordance with the
regulations promulgated and enforced by the Pennsylvania Department

has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been
accepted by the landowner (and provided that the landowner has not
defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval),
shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by the action of

a public nuisance.
B. If the landowner provides for establishment of an association of

shall show cause why Slippery Rock Borough Council should cease
maintenance based on the ability of the organization or the residents to
again discharge such maintenance responsibility. Public hearings shall
be called thereafter or less frequently than once per year to consider
termination of Borough maintenance until such termination occurs.
E. The decision to continue or cease maintenance shall lie with Slippery
Rock Borough Council.

shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have rights to common open space and

A. Zone lot regulations.
(1) Existing lots of record. In any R District, a single-family dwelling
may be erected on a nonconforming lot of official record at the
effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto,
regardless of its area or width, the owner of which does not own
any adjoining property which would create a conforming lot if all or
part of said property were combined with subject zone lot;
provided, however, that no lot or lots in single ownership shall
hereafter be reduced so as to create one or more nonconforming
lots; and provided further that, on any nonconforming lot, no side
yard adjoining a side street shall be less than 10 feet; provided
further that the rear yard of any such lot shall in no case be less
than that required in the specific zoning district, and the side and
front yards shall also be as required in the specific zoning district.
(2) Corner lots. At all street intersections, no obstructions to vision
(other than an existing building, post, column or tree) exceeding 30
inches in height above the established grade of the street shall be
erected or maintained on any lot within the clear sight triangle.
(See the current Chapter 350, Subdivision and Land Development,
of the Code of the Borough of Slippery Rock.)
(3) Through lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership
extends from a street to an alley, the widest street shall be deemed
the street upon which the property fronts, and no principal
structures and no dwelling shall be erected on the rear of such lot.
(4) Required area or space cannot be reduced. The area or dimension
of any lot, yard, parking area or other space shall not be reduced to
less than the minimum required by this chapter, and if already less

on any adjoining lot fronting on a side street. However, any
corner lot delineated by subdivision after the adoption of this

such unimproved lot, the front yard may be reduced to the greatest
depth of the front yard of the two adjoining improved lots, but shall
not be less than 15 feet; provided, however, that where any lot shall
front on a right-of-way which is proposed on the Official Map of the
Borough to be widened by the Borough or any lawful county, state

B. There are hereby established three types of screening applicable
throughout the Borough. The screening requirements chart included in
Subsection C of this section shall be used to determine which type of
screen the developing use must provide along the perimeter boundary
abutting a developed lot.
(1) Opaque screen, Type A: a screen that is opaque from the ground to
a height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions
from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque
screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to
create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque
screen may include a wall or fence, but a minimum of 70% of the
screen shall consist of densely planted vegetation. Compliance of
planted vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species
or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of
the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity,
the portion of intermittent visual obstruction should not contain
any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide.
Suggested planting patterns follow:
§ 375-85 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-85
1:479
(2) Semi-opaque screen, Type B: a screen that is opaque from the
ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual
obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20
feet. The semi-opaque screen may include a wall, fence or
landscaped earth berm, but a minimum of 70% of the screen shall
consist of densely planted vegetation. Compliance of planted
vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average
mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field
observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of
intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely
unobstructed openings more than 15 feet wide. Suggested planting
patterns follow:
§ 375-85 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 375-85
1:480
(3) Broken screen, Type C: a screen composed of intermittent visual
obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The
broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation
of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between
the spaces. The broken screen may include a wall, fence or
landscaped earth berm, but a minimum of 70% of the screen shall
consist of densely planted vegetation or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will
be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of
foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing

ARTICLE XVII
Conditional Uses; Special Exception Uses
§ 375-87. Uses not deemed nonconforming.
Any use which is permitted as a conditional use or a use by special exception
in a district under the terms of this chapter (other than a change through
Zoning Hearing Board action from a nonconforming use to another use not
generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming
use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a
conforming use.
§ 375-88. Granting of conditional uses.
Where the Borough Council, in this chapter, has stated conditional uses to
be granted or denied by the Borough Council pursuant to express standards
and criteria, and pursuant to recommendation by the Planning Commission,
the Borough Council shall hold hearings on and decide requests for such
conditional uses in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting
a conditional use, the Borough Council may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as
it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
A. Submission of application. The granting of a conditional use by the
Borough Council shall be predicated upon the developer's submission
of a written application demonstrating that the development for which
the conditional use is sought:
(1) Will not endanger the public health and safety if located where
proposed, and that the use will not deteriorate the environment or
generate nuisance conditions such as traffic congestion, noise,
dust, smoke, glare or vibration;
(2) Meets all other requirements of this chapter in the zoning district
where the use is proposed;
(3) Is in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan for the
Borough of Slippery Rock and in harmony with the area in which it
is proposed; and
(4) Is an appropriate use on the proposed site. The applicant/developer
shall submit single deed and drawings to scale. The drawings shall
indicate the boundaries of his property, location of adjacent streets,
the location and height of proposed buildings on the property,
proposed grading and storm drainage, and location and number of
proposed parking spaces and proposed curb cuts.
B. Action by the Planning Commission. Upon the filing of an application for
a conditional use, the Borough Council shall submit each such
conditional use application to the Planning Commission at least 30 days
prior to the hearing on such conditional use to provide the Planning

§ 375-89. Accessory residential structure to house caretakers or
health care staff.151

recommendations shall be in writing, with copies transmitted to the
applicant and to the Borough Council.
C. Public hearing. The Borough Council shall call and hold a public
hearing with proper notice as described in § 375-145 of this chapter. An
applicant shall complete the presentation of his case-in-chief within 100
days of the first hearing. Upon the request of the applicant, the Board
or hearing officer shall assure that the applicant receives at least seven
hours of hearings within the 100 days, including the first hearing.
Persons opposed to the application shall complete the presentation of
their opposition to the application within 100 days of the first hearing
held after the completion of the applicant's case-in-chief. An applicant
may, upon request, be granted additional hearings to complete his casein-
chief, provided the persons opposed to the application are granted an
equal number of additional hearings. Persons opposed to the
application may, upon the written consent or consent on the record by
the applicant and municipality, be granted additional hearings to
complete their opposition to the application, provided the applicant is
granted an equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal.150
D. Action by Borough Council. The Borough Council shall, upon review of
the Planning Commission's report, determine whether or not the
conditional use is to be granted. If Council grants the conditional use,
they shall instruct the Zoning Officer to issue a building permit for its
construction. If the Council denies the conditional use, the owner/
developer may reapply for the same use no sooner than one year after
the date of denial or denial of appeal to the Butler County Court of
Common Pleas if filed within 30 days after notice of the decision is
issued.
A. The occupant of the accessory residential structure shall be responsible
for the care of the occupant or occupants of the principal residential
use on the lot, or, where members of the immediate family are
concerned, the occupant or occupants of the principal residential use

residential structure.
B. The accessory residential structure shall be a temporary use and
removed when care is no longer needed.

§ 375-91. Cellular transmission towers.153
The following regulations shall apply to all transmission facilities proposed
for placement in the M-1 Light Manufacturing District:
(6) Where live performances are given, separate stage and viewing
areas shall be provided with separate access to each and no
connecting access between the areas.
E. Alcoholic beverages shall not be sold on the premises of an adult
business.
F. An annual occupancy permit issued by the Zoning Officer shall be
secured prior to the operation of any adult business.
A. Lot size. The lot size dimensions (depth and width) shall be dictated by
the fall radius of the tower. The minimum dimensions shall be the radius
of the height of the tower in each direction. (Example: A two-hundredfoot-
high tower would be required to have a four-hundred-foot-diameter
parcel.)
B. The communications company is required to demonstrate, using
technological evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed,
in order to satisfy its function in the company's grid system.
C. If the communications company proposes to build a tower (as opposed
to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), it is required to
demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a onequarter-
mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to install
the antenna on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than
economic ones. This would include smokestacks, water towers, tall
buildings, antenna support structures of other communications
companies, other communications towers (fire, police, etc.), and other
tall structures. Slippery Rock Borough may deny the application to
construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort
to mount the antenna on an existing structure.
D. The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is the minimum
height required to function satisfactorily. No antenna that is taller than
this minimum height shall be approved. In addition, no antenna shall
exceed 200 feet in height.
E. All communications towers must be stealth towers, where possible. A
"stealth tower" is a communications tower which is not recognizable as
a conventional communications tower (e.g., a metal lattice structure),
but instead is disguised or concealed in such a fashion as to conform to
its surroundings. Examples of such stealth towers include a tower
which looks like a tree or a clock tower, or one which is concealed in a
church steeple or concrete silo.

§ 375-90 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 375-91
1:490
F. The Borough Council may waive the stealth tower requirement where
the applicant can demonstrate that the requirement is not necessary to
protect the health, safety and welfare, considering items such as impact
on surrounding and abutting property values; height; screening;
number of uses per tower, including public uses; location; and actual
setbacks.
G. Setbacks from base of antenna support structure. If a new antenna
support structure is constructed (as opposed to mounting the antenna
on an existing structure), the minimum distance between the base of
the support structure or any guy wire anchors and any property line
shall be the largest of the following:
(1) One hundred percent of antenna height.
(2) The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district.
(3) Fifty feet minimum.
H. Fencing. A fence shall be required around the antenna support
structure and other equipment, unless the antenna is mounted on an
existing structure. The fence shall be a minimum of eight feet in height.
I. Landscaping. The following landscaping shall be required to screen as
much of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding the
support structure, and any other ground-level features (such as a
building), and in general soften the appearance of the cell site. The
Borough may permit any combination of existing vegetation,
topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of
landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the
required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted on an existing
structure, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure,
landscaping shall not be required.
(1) An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The
screen can be either a hedge (planted three feet on center
maximum) or a row of evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on center
maximum). The evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six
feet at planting and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet at maturity.
(2) In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
J. In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in
the community in the future, the proposed support structure shall be
required to accommodate other users, including other communications
companies, and local police, fire, ambulance services and municipal
authority and road departments. In addition, a linear two-mile
separation shall be maintained between communications towers,
measured from the base of the support structure.

See also Chapter 350, Subdivision and Land Development, of the Code of
the Borough of Slippery Rock.
K. The communications company must demonstrate that it is licensed by
the Federal Communications Commission.
L. Antenna support structures under 200 feet in height should be painted
silver or have a galvanized finish retained, in order to reduce the visual
impact. Support structures may be painted green up to the height of
nearby trees. Support structures near airports shall meet all
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation and
Federal Aviation Administration regulations. No antenna support
structure may be artificially lighted except as provided for and required
by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation
and FAA.
M. A land development plan shall be required for all cell sites, showing the
antenna, antenna support structure, building, fencing, buffering, access
to public rights-of-way, and all other items required in Chapter 350,
Subdivision and Land Development. The site plan shall not be required
if the antenna is to be mounted on an existing structure.
N. In granting the use, the Council may attach reasonable conditions
warranted to protect the public health, safety and welfare, including,
but not limited to, location, fencing, screening, increased setbacks and
the right to use said facilities for public purposes.
O. All approvals will be only for specific facilities set forth in the
application. No additions or alterations thereto will be permitted
without a new application.

Nonconforming Uses and Structures
§ 375-119. General provisions.
§ 375-120. Continuation of use.
A use, building or structure, lawfully in existence at the effective date of
this chapter, which shall be made nonconforming at the passage of this
chapter, or any applicable amendment thereto, may be continued except as
otherwise provided in this chapter.
§ 375-121. Nonconforming uses of land.
Where at the time of passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and
where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost
exceeding the current assessed valuation, the use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
A. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and
structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful at the time this
chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall only be enlarged upon, expanded or extended to a
certain degree, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
B. Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a
structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises or
by the addition of other, in excess of 50% of the gross floor area,
existing structure or structure and premises in combination.
C. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which
actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
§ 375-119 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-121
1:505
§ 375-122. Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
§ 375-123. Additional restrictions.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost not
exceeding the current assessed valuation or more, or of structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that would not be allowed in the district under
the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land in excess of 50% of the gross
floor area occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter;
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
C. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than one year, and there has been a clear intention to
abandon such use, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land
is located; and
D. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
A. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof
may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
B. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of up to 100% of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it may be reconstructed in its
original location and within the original footprint; and
C. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district
in which it is located after it is moved.
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
§ 375-121 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 375-123
1:506
§ 375-124. Repairs and maintenance.
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except as
specified herein and except in changing the use of the structure to a
use permitted in the district in which it is located;
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building in excess of 50% of
the gross floor area of the existing nonconforming building unless the
Borough Zoning Hearing Board approves such extension of lot coverage
as a special exception in compliance with the provisions of § 375-106;
C. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be
changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Zoning
Hearing Board, either by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the Zoning Hearing Board may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter;
D. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a

specifically provided for herein, the provisions for a use which is so
mentioned and to which said use is similar, in the opinion of the Zoning
Hearing Board, shall apply.

parking spaces, open or enclosed, shall be located on the same lot as
the use to which such spaces are accessory, except that such space may
be provided elsewhere but shall be provided within a radius of no
greater distance than 250 feet from that lot, and provided further that

§ 375-147. Variances.
MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10501 et seq., 10701 et seq. Where such
determination relates only to development not involving an Article
V or VII application, the appeal from such determination of the
Zoning Officer or the Borough Engineer shall be to the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to this section. Where the applicable land
use ordinance vests jurisdiction for final administration of
subdivision and land development applications in the Planning
Commission, all appeals from determinations under this subsection
shall be to the Planning Commission, and all appeals from the
decision of the Planning Commission shall be to court.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographic or other physical conditions
peculiar to the property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due
to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attached such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 375-146 SLIPPERY ROCK CODE § 375-148

§ 375-148. Form of applications to Board.
All applications to the Board shall be in writing on forms prescribed by
the Board and provided by the Borough. Every application shall include the
following:
§ 375-149. Stay of proceedings.
A. The name and address of the applicant or the appellant;
B. The name and address of the owner of the lot to be affected by such
proposed change or appeal;
C. A brief description and location of the lot to be affected by such
proposed change or appeal;
D. A statement of the section of this chapter under which the application is
made, and reasons why it should be granted, or a statement of the
section of this chapter governing the situation in which the alleged
erroneous ruling is being appealed, and the reasons for this appeal; and
E. A reasonably accurate description of the present improvements and the
additions or changes intended to be made under this application,
indicating the size of such proposed improvements, materials, and
general construction thereof. In addition, there shall be attached a plot
plan of the real property to be affected, indicating the location and size
of the lot and size of improvements thereon and proposed to be erected
thereon.
A. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall
be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or
body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to

Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or
agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance
and for special exception may be filed with the Board by any landowner or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
§ 375-151. Expiration of decision.
Unless otherwise specified by the Board, a decision on any appeal or
request for a variance or special exception shall expire if the applicant fails
to obtain any necessary building permit or comply with the conditions of
said authorized permit within six months from the date of authorization
thereof.

by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond,
the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner
and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals,
shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees
incurred by the petitioner.

A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by the Borough if such
proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any
manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice,
knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If
such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall
be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of
anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on
a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a
challenge to the validity of this chapter or an amendment hereto or map
or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval
except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates
from the approved tentative approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.

B. The Zoning Officer shall meet the qualifications established by the
Borough and shall be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Borough a working knowledge of municipal zoning.
C. The Zoning Officer shall administer this chapter in accordance with its
literal terms and shall not have the power to permit any construction or
any use or change of use which does not conform to this chapter.
D. The Zoning Officer is hereby authorized to institute civil enforcement
proceedings as a means of enforcement when acting within the scope of
his employment.
A. Purpose. To determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
no person shall erect, alter, move or convert any structure or building,
or part thereof, nor alter the use of any land, subsequent to the
adoption of this chapter until a building/zoning permit has been issued
by the Zoning Officer.
B. Application for permits. All such applications shall be accompanied by
plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and
dimensions of the lot or lots to be built upon, its block and lot number as
recorded, the date of official record of any lot or lots on which
construction is proposed, the exact size and location of any building,
sign, parking or loading area or other physical feature existing or
proposed on the lot, the existing and intended use of each building or
part of a building, the number of families, dwelling units, employees,
offices, or other appropriate units of occupancy which the building is
designed to accommodate, and such other information as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. One copy of such
plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans shall be
approved; one copy each of all applications with accompanying plans
and documents shall become a public record after a permit is issued or
denied.
C. Issuance of permits.
(1) It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to issue a building/zoning
permit, provided he is satisfied that the structure, building, sign,
parking area or premises, and the proposed use thereof, conform
with all requirements of this chapter and that all other reviews and
actions, if any, called for in this chapter have been complied with
and all necessary approvals secured thereof.
§ 375-154 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-155
1:541
§ 375-156. Occupancy permits.
(2) All building/zoning permits for residential or commercial
construction shall be issued in duplicate, and one copy shall be kept
conspicuously on the premises affected and protected from the
weather whenever construction work is being performed thereon.
No owner, contractor, workman or any other person shall perform
any building operations of any kind unless a building/zoning permit
covering such operation has been displayed as required by this
chapter, nor shall they perform building operations of any kind
after notification of the revocation of said building/zoning permit.
D. Building completion.
(1) All structures, except commercial or industrial buildings, must be
completed within 365 days of the date on which a building/zoning
permit is issued. Any request for extension of time for construction
must be made in writing to the Zoning Officer. Any resulting
extension may only be for a period of 60 days. Not more than three
such extensions are permissible.
(2) All commercial or industrial buildings must be completed within 18
months of the date on which a building/zoning permit is issued.
Commercial and industrial buildings with more than 40,000 square
feet of floor area will have an additional six months for completion.
(3) Failure to comply with the above requirements shall constitute a
violation of this chapter and subject the owner or operator to
enforcement remedies.
E. Denial of permits. When the Zoning Officer is not satisfied that the
applicant's proposed development will meet the requirements of this
chapter, he shall refuse to issue a building/zoning permit, and the
applicant may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board for a reversal of the
Zoning Officer's decision.
F. Revocation of permits.
(1) If it shall appear at any time to the Zoning Officer that the
application or accompanying plan is in any material respect false or
misleading, or that work is being done upon the premises differing
materially from that called for in the applications filed with him
under existing laws or ordinances, he may forthwith revoke the
building/zoning permit, whereupon it shall be the duty of the
person holding the same to surrender it and all copies thereof to
the said Zoning Officer.
(2) After the building/zoning permit has been revoked, the Zoning
Officer may, before issuing a new building/zoning permit, require
the applicant to file an indemnity bond in favor of the Borough with
sufficient surety to cover the cost of removing the building if it does
not so comply.

actual inspection of the premises by the Zoning Officer, he shall,
upon finding the facts to be as represented, issue in duplicate an
occupancy permit, certifying that the premises comply with the
provisions of this chapter and may be used for the purposes set
forth in the permit, which purposes shall conform with the
requirements of this chapter.

other person shall use or occupy any building or structure
thereafter erected or altered, the use of which shall be changed
after the passage of this chapter, without first procuring an
occupancy permit, provided that an occupancy permit, once
granted, shall continue in effect so long as there is not change of
use, regardless of change in the personnel or tenants or occupants.
B. For existing uses.
(1) Upon written request from the owner, tenant or occupant, the
Zoning Officer, after inspection, shall issue an occupancy permit for
an existing use legally existing at the time this chapter is made
effective, certifying the extent and kind of such use and whether
any such existing use conforms with the provisions of this chapter.
(2) No change or extension of use and no alterations shall be made in a
nonconforming use or premises without an occupancy permit

change, extension or alteration is in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.

53 P.S. § 10607, is hereby declared optional.
B. Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In
addition, if the proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map change,
notice of said public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the
Borough at points deemed sufficient by the Borough along the

of the hearing. Further, at least 30 days prior to the hearing date, notice
of the public hearing shall be mailed to property owners within the area
being rezoned.
C. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning

to the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on
such proposed amendment to provide the Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations.
D. If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised, to include land
previously not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another
public hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on
the amendment.
E. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the

F. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the County Planning Commission.
A. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the Borough
Council with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in Section 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10916.1. the
Borough Council shall commence a hearing thereon within 60 days of
§ 375-163 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-164
1:547
§ 375-165. Borough curative amendments.
If the Borough determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
the request as provided in Section 916.1. The curative amendment and
challenge shall be referred to the Planning Commission and the County
Planning Commission as provided in Section 609, and notice of the
hearing thereon shall be given as provided in Sections 610 and 916.1

not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance
with this subsection and a court subsequently rules that the challenge
has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of
invalidity for this entire chapter and Zoning Map, but only for those
provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative
amendment.
C. The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the
challenged defects. The Borough Council shall consider the curative
amendments, plans and explanatory materials submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;

woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.

Borough shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the
validity of, this chapter pursuant to the provisions of Section 609 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10609, in order to

Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under Section 609.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10609.1, nor shall
the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested under
Section 909.1 or 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1, 10916.1, subsequent to the declaration and
proposal based upon the grounds identified by Subsection A. Upon

to a cure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 609.1 and 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1,

any landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of this chapter
for which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
section.
D. The Borough, having utilized the procedures set forth in this section,
