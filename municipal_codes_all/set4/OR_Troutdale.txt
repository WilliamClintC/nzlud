TROUTDALE, OREGON - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Troutdale, Oregon 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Troutdale, Oregon Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1987, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of James R. Jennings, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ord. No. 853, passed May 28, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

    SECTION 21. CITY MANAGER 
A.  The office of city manager is established as the administrative head of the city government. The city manager is responsible to the mayor and council for the proper administration of all city business. The city manager will assist the mayor and council in the development of city policies, and carry out policies set by ordinances and resolutions. 
B.  A majority of the council must appoint and may remove the manager. The appointment must be made without regard to political considerations and solely on the basis of education and experience in competencies and practices of local government management. 
C.  The manager need not reside in the city. 
D.  The manager may be appointed for a definite or an indefinite term, and may be removed at any time by a majority of the council. The council must fill the office by appointment as soon as practicable after the vacancy occurs. 
E.  The manager must: 
(1)  Attend all council meetings unless excused by the mayor or council; 
(2)  Make reports and recommendations to the mayor and council about the needs of the city; 
(3)  Administer and enforce all city ordinances, resolutions, franchises, leases, contracts, permits, and other council decisions; 
(4)  Appoint, supervise and remove city employees; 
(5)  Organize city departments and administrative structure; 
(6)  Prepare and administer the annual city budget;

I.  No council member may directly or indirectly attempt to coerce the manager or a candidate for the office of manager in the appointment or removal of any city employee, or in administrative decisions regarding city property or contracts. Violation of this prohibition is grounds for removal from office by a majority of the council after a public hearing. In council meetings, councilors may discuss or suggest anything with the manager relating to city business. Nothing in this Charter restricts the authority of the mayor or any council member to discuss the strengths, weaknesses, or need for city staff, nor to discuss any city contract or property that either exists or is contemplated, with the city manager. Such discussions may be held privately, at the discretion of the participants, but shall conform to the requirements of law. 
(Res. No. 2060, 6-22-2010; Ref. date, 11-2-2010; Res. No. 2084, 11-23-2010; Res. No. 2322, 2-9-2016) 
    SECTION 22. MUNICIPAL COURT AND JUDGE.

2.  Is adjudged to be incompetent; 
3.  Is recalled from office; or, 
4.  Resigns.

At the general biennial election in the second year of the term, a person shall be elected to the council for a two-year term.

    The vote on motions to read or adopt ordinances and resolutions is taken by roll call vote. All other votes may be by calling for "ayes" and "nos." Any councilor may request and obtain a roll call vote on any item. At the conclusion of any vote, the recorder informs the presiding officer of the results of the vote, and the presiding officer announces the vote. A councilor does not explain his or her vote during roll call. Any council member may change the member's vote prior to the next order of business. The council president or appointed presiding officer acting temporarily as mayor may vote in all cases. Every councilor present when a question is put votes for or against the question unless excused by the council or required by law to abstain. 
(Ord. 608 § 2 (part), 1994) 
2.08.180 - Council discussion. 
    The following general rules govern council discussion and debate: 
A.  When any councilor is about to speak in debate or deliver any matter to the council, the councilor shall respectfully address the presiding officer and shall confine remarks to the question in debate and avoid personalities. 
B.  When a motion is made and seconded, no councilor shall speak more than twice on the motion without permission of the council, nor more than once until every member shall have had the opportunity to speak on the motion. 
C.  Councilors are open to the ideas and testimony of citizens and suspend judgement until review of all information and testimony is completed. 
D.  When an action is deferred, the council specifies what additional information is needed and when an item will be reconsidered. 
E.  Questions are asked to clarify information rather than to state an opinion. When possible, councilors ask staff questions before a meeting. 
F.  Councilors are brief and succinct in stating views. Councilors are open, direct and candid in their communications with each other. Councilors should avoid personal attacks. 
G.  Remarks are limited to the question at hand. City policy should not be changed during consideration of a specific question. Instead, policy changes should be scheduled separately on a future agenda. 
H.  The council does not attempt to edit or rewrite prepared ordinances during public meetings because of the potential impact on other issues. Amendments to ordinances are appropriate. 
(Ord. 733 § 2, 2003; Ord. 608 § 2 (part), 1994) 
2.08.190 - Motions. 
    The following rules govern motions: 
A.  A motion is clearly and concisely stated by its mover. The presiding officer states the name of the councilor making the motion and the name of the councilor seconding the motion. 
B.  A motion may be withdrawn by the mover at any time without the consent of the council. 
C.  If a motion does not receive a second, it dies. Nominations, withdrawal of motions, agenda order and point of orders can proceed without a second. 
D.  A motion that receives a tie vote fails. 
E.  A motion to table is not debatable and precludes all amendments or debate of the issue under consideration. If the motion prevails, the matter may be taken from the table only by adding it to the agenda of the next regular meeting, at which time discussion will continue. If an item is tabled, it cannot be reconsidered at the same meeting. 
F.  A motion to postpone to a certain time is debatable and amendable, and may be reconsidered at the same meeting. The question being postponed must be considered at a later time at the same meeting or at a specifically identified later meeting. 
G.  A motion to postpone indefinitely is debatable and is not amendable, and may be reconsidered at the same meeting only if it received an affirmative vote. The object of this motion is not to postpone, but to reject the question without risking a direct vote when the maker of this motion is in doubt as to the outcome of the question. 
H.  A motion to call for the question closes debate on the main motion and is not debatable. This motion must receive a second and fails without a two-thirds vote of the councilors present. Debate is reopened if the motion fails. 
I.  A motion to amend can be made to a motion that is on the floor and is seconded. Motions that cannot be amended are: motion to adjourn, agenda order, lay on the table, point of order, reconsideration and take from the table. A motion to amend an amendment is not in order. Amendments are voted upon first, and then the main motion as amended. 
J.  Council discusses a motion only after it has been moved and seconded. The motion maker, presiding officer or recorder repeats the motion prior to any vote. 
K.  When a question has been decided, any councilor who voted on the prevailing side may move for reconsideration at the same or next meeting. Once a matter has been reconsidered, no motion for further reconsideration is in order without unanimous consent of the council. 
L.  All cases not provided for in these rules are governed by Roberts Rules of Order (Revised).

Chapter 2.22 - NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS 
Sections: 

2.22.010 - Findings. 
    The city council of the city of Troutdale believes there exists a need to maintain channels of communication with the people of Troutdale on matters affecting the livability of their neighborhood and the community in general. It is the intent of the city council, through the creation of neighborhood associations, to foster a partnership of open communication between the city and its neighborhoods; to enhance the environment in which citizens are afforded an opportunity to participate in government decisions; to foster cooperation and consensus among diverse interests; to assist the city and neighborhood residents in developing solutions to mutual problems; and to develop in the citizens a sense of personal pride and responsibility for their neighborhood. A neighborhood association is not a city committee or a governing body that has been given the authority to make decisions or to issue advice or recommendations regarding city policies or administration. 
(Ord. 751 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2004) 
2.22.020 - Definition. 
    A neighborhood association is a group of residents, property owners, businesses and nonprofit organizations within the boundaries established by the affected residents, property owners, businesses and nonprofits of the "neighborhood" for the purpose of considering and acting upon a broad range of issues affecting their neighborhood's livability and to foster open communication and partnership with the city. 
(Ord. 751 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2004) 
2.22.030 - Authority to form. 
    The residents, property owners, and representatives of businesses and nonprofit organizations of any city area not recognized currently may form a neighborhood association. Associations shall make application with the city for formal recognition as a neighborhood association under the provisions of this chapter. Upon receipt of application of an association, city staff shall issue a full report and recommendation to the city council. Recognition of a neighborhood association shall be done by adoption of a resolution by the council. When making decisions and deliberating official city business, the council will consider the recommendations of affected neighborhood associations that have been officially recognized by council in the same manner that the council considers recommendations or testimony from other interested citizens, groups or organizations. 
(Ord. 751 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2004) 
2.22.040 - Bylaws. 
    Each neighborhood association shall adopt bylaws, which will at a minimum include rules governing process and procedure for: 
A.  Election and term of officers;

E.  Frequency of meetings which shall be at least once per year; 
F.  Management of the neighborhood budget and records, including but not limited to maintenance of meeting sign-in sheets and other records required by the bylaws; and 
G.  Notifying members of association meetings, holding open meetings and retaining association records (the public records and public meetings laws may be a useful guide). 
    The initial bylaws shall be presented to the city council as part of the official recognition process, in accordance with Section 2.22.030, and shall be filed with the city. Any bylaw changes must also be filed with the city. 
(Ord. 751 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2004) 
2.22.050 - Membership. 
    The membership of neighborhood associations shall include all residents, property owners, business licensees and representatives of nonprofit organizations within the neighborhood boundaries.

2.22.060 - Boundaries. 
    Boundaries of associations shall substantially conform to the boundaries as shown on Attachment 1A of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the City of Troutdale Neighborhood Association Map, adopted by reference herein, and may not overlap other city neighborhood association boundaries. Boundary changes may occur after residents in the affected area are given notice and the opportunity to vote as prescribed by the neighborhood association's bylaws. The city must be notified about any changes to neighborhood boundaries in writing within a reasonable time period. The city council and relevant city departments will be made aware of neighborhood boundary changes. In no case shall the boundary of an association be the same as the boundary of a single homeowner's association. 
(Ord. 751 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2004) 
2.22.070 - Funding. 
    Membership fees shall be voluntary and shall not bar any resident from neighborhood association membership or voting privileges. Voluntary dues, contributions, contracts, grants or subscriptions may be used by a neighborhood association as provided for in the neighborhood association's bylaws, as well as any applicable public funding requirements. The city is not required to, and does not intend to provide funding or resources, such as staff time, materials, supplies or postage, to neighborhood associations.

As soon as the director shall procure such facts and information as is able to be obtained, upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any seller, the director shall proceed to determine and assess against such seller the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by having it served personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the seller so assessed at the last known place of address.

In the event a claim is determined by the director to be a valid claim, in a manner prescribed by the director a seller may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously collected or received. The seller shall notify director of claimant's choice no later than fifteen days following the date director mailed the determination. In the event claimant has not notified the director of claimant's choice within the fifteen-day period and the seller is still in business, a credit will be granted against the tax liability for the next reporting period. If the seller is no longer in business, a refund check will be mailed to claimant at the address provided in the claim form.

A.  A violation of this chapter shall be punishable by a mandatory fine not to exceed two hundred dollars. Each violation of a separate provision of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense and each day that a violation of this chapter is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense.

All books, invoices, accounts and other records shall be made available within the city limits and be open at any time during regular business hours for examination by the director or an authorized agent of the director. 
B.  If the examinations or investigations disclose that any reports of sellers filed with the director pursuant to the requirements herein have shown incorrectly the amount of tax accruing, the director may make such changes in subsequent reports and payments, or make such refunds, as may be necessary to correct the errors disclosed by its examinations or investigations. 
C.  The seller shall reimburse the city for reasonable costs of the examination or investigation if the action disclosed that the seller paid ninety-seven percent or less of the tax owing for the period of the examination or investigation. In the event that such examination or investigation results in an assessment by and an additional payment due to the city, such additional payment shall be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent per year from the date the original tax payment was due.

4.  Any portion, or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation, either interior or exterior, is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not anchored, attached or fastened in place securely and is therefore reasonably likely to fall, become detached or dislodged, or collapse and cause injury to persons or damage to property. 
5.  Exterior or interior bearing walls or other vertical structural members list, lean or buckle to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center of gravity does not fall within the middle one-third of the base of the vertical component.

If the judge is satisfied that cause for the removal and abatement of the violation(s) exists and that the other requirements for granting the application are satisfied, the judge shall issue the abatement warrant, particularly describing the person or persons authorized to execute the warrant, the property to be entered, and a statement of the general types and estimated quantity of the items to be removed or conditions abated. The warrant shall contain a direction that it be executed on any day of the week between the hours of eight a.m. and six p.m., or where the judge has specially determined upon a showing that it cannot be effectively executed between those hours, that it be executed at any additional or other time of the day or night.

2.  Unoccupied Property. In executing an abatement warrant on unoccupied property, the person authorized to execute the warrant need not inform anyone of the person's authority and purpose, but may promptly enter the designated property if it is at the time unoccupied or not in the possession of any person or at the time reasonably believed to be in such condition. In such case a copy of the abatement warrant shall be conspicuously posted on the property. 
3.  Return. An abatement warrant must be executed within fourteen working days of its issue and returned to the judge by whom it was issued within fourteen working days from its date of execution. After the expiration of the time prescribed by this subsection, the warrant, unless executed, is void.

12.02.015 - Definitions. 
    "Improvement fee" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements to be constructed. 
    "Qualified public improvement" means a capital improvement that is required as a condition of development approval, is identified in the capital improvement plan, and is either: 
1.  Not located on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval; or 
2.  Located in whole or in part on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval and required to be built larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the particular development project to which the improvement fee is related. 
    "Reimbursement fee" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements already constructed or under construction. 
    "System development charge" means a reimbursement fee, an improvement fee, or a combination thereof assessed and collected at the time of increased usage of a capital improvement or issuance of a development permit, building permit, or connection to the capital improvement. 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.02.020 - Intent and scope. 
A.  Pursuant to the statutes of the state of Oregon and the powers granted in the Charter of the city, the council finds, declares, and affirms its intent to impose system development charges. 
B.  The purpose of the system development charge is to impose an equitable share of the public costs of capital improvements upon those developments that create the need for or increase the demands on capital improvements. 
C.  The system development charge as imposed by this chapter is separate from and in addition to any applicable tax, assessment, charge, fee in lieu of assessment, or fee otherwise provided by law or imposed as a condition of development. 
D.  Payment of a system development charge secures an amount of system capacity for the benefit of the property where the development that utilized the system exists. System capacity that is secured as a result of development on a particular piece of property shall not be transferred to another property except as provided for in Section 12.02.080(E). 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.02.030 - System development charges established. 
A.  Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or other local or state law, a system development charge is imposed upon all new development within the city, and all new development outside the boundary of the city, that connects to, utilizes, or otherwise places a demand on the sanitary sewer system, storm sewer system, water system, transportation system, or park and recreation system. 
B.  System development charges for each type of capital improvement shall be calculated through application of the methodologies described in this chapter and further described in the appropriate implementing resolution. The amount of each system development charge shall be adopted initially by council resolution. Changes in the amounts shall also be adopted by resolution. Inflationary cost impacts shall be measured and calculated annually by the city manager and presented to the council for consideration. Such calculations will be based upon Pacific Northwest construction cost changes in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index (ENR Index) as represented by the city of Seattle, Washington, or any successor index to this measurement. Alternatively, the resolution setting the amount of a system development charge may authorize an automatic annual inflationary adjustment of the system development charge using the ENR Index or any other comparable index specifically identified in the resolution. 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 707 § 2, 2001; Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
(Ord. No. 801, § 1, 1-11-2011) 
12.02.040 - Methodology. 
A.  The methodology used to establish a reimbursement fee shall consider the cost of then-existing facilities, prior contributions by then-existing users, the value of unused capacity, rate-making principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements, and other relevant factors. The methodology shall promote the objective that future systems users shall contribute no more than an equitable share of the cost of then-existing facilities. 
B.  The methodology used to establish the improvement fee shall consider the cost of projected capital improvements needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related and shall provide for a credit against the fee for the construction of a qualified public improvement. 
C.  The city recorder shall maintain a list of persons who have made a written request for notification prior to adoption or amendment of a methodology for any system development charge. Written notice shall be mailed to persons on the list at least ninety days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend a system development charge, and the methodology supporting the adoption or amendment shall be available at least sixty days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend. The city recorder may periodically delete names from the list, but at least thirty days prior to removing a name from the list must notify the person whose name is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list. 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 740 § 2, 2003; Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.02.050 - Compliance with state law. 
A.  The revenues received from the system development charges shall be budgeted and expended as provided by state law. Such revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for as required by state law. Their reporting shall be included in the city's comprehensive annual financial report required by ORS Chapter 294. B. The plan for capital improvements required by state law as the basis for expending the improvement fee component of systems development charge revenues shall be the Troutdale Capital Improvements Plan (CIP), adopted facilities plans, or the capital improvement plan of any other governmental entity with which the city has cooperative agreement for the financing of commonly-used public improvements by the collection of system development charges, provided such plans of other governmental entities conform with state law and are consistent with the city's CIP and the city's comprehensive plan. 
C.  The council may modify the capital improvement plan and project list at any time. If a system development charge will be increased by a proposed modification of the list to include a capacity increasing capital improvement, the city shall provide at least thirty days' written notice of the proposed modification to the persons who have requested written notice under Section 12.02.040(C). 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994)

1.  A permit for new construction; or 
2.  A permit for the renovation, rehabilitation, alteration or modification of a structure or use; or 
3.  A public works permit allowing connection to the water, sanitary sewer or storm drainage system(s); or 
4.  A permit authorizing access to a public street. 
B.  If development is commenced, usage is increased, or connection is made to the water system, sanitary sewer system, storm sewer system, or transportation system without an appropriate permit, or when no permit is required, the system development charge is payable within thirty days following a demand for payment by the city, and it will be unlawful for anyone to continue with the construction or use of the development until the charge has been paid. 
C.  The owner of property where increased usage occurs is responsible for notifying the director of such. 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 707 § 3, 2001; Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.02.070 - Exemptions and pre-existing conditions. 
A.  The following are exempt from the system development charges imposed in this chapter: 
1.  Existing facilities as of July 11, 1995 (for transportation SDC's only), but the exemption shall not include additions to or expansion of any existing facility. 
2.  The impervious surface of a street, road, highway, runway, or taxiway constructed by a governmental entity or by a private entity when the street, road, highway, runway, or taxiway is to be transferred to a governmental entity immediately upon its completion. 
B.  In calculating the system development charge, the amount of the charge shall be reduced by the current value of system capacity previously purchased from the city for the parcel(s) under development. System capacity shall be measured in hydraulic equivalents for water, in equivalent residential units for sanitary sewer, in PM peak hour trip ends for transportation, and in impervious surface area for storm sewer. When an existing or previous development has used one or more of these city systems but predates the imposition of system development charges, there shall be a presumption of the purchase of system capacity through some other means, equivalent to the normal and customary demand such a development places on the applicable system(s), and the appropriate reduction in the system development charge shall be allowed. No reduction shall be made if the parcel was not within the corporate limits of the city when the existing or previous development occurred. 
(Ord. 785 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 655 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 640-O (part), 1996: Ord. 630-O § 1 (part), 1995: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.02.080 - Credits. 
A.  A credit shall be allowed only for the improvement fee charged for the type of qualified public improvement being constructed. Credit may be granted only for the cost of that portion of the improvement that exceeds city standards or the facility size or capacity needed to serve the development project. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies for credit. 
B.  When the construction of a qualified public improvement gives rise to a credit amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be levied against the project receiving development approval, the excess credit may be applied against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project. Credits shall be used within five years from the date the credit is given. 
C.  All credit requests must be in writing and filed with the city manager prior to the issuance of a building permit. A building permit shall not be issued until the credit request is acted upon by the city manager. The request shall clearly show the capacity of the minimum qualified public improvement required for the development and its cost, the capacity of the proposed qualified public improvement and its cost, the reason the improvement creates a public benefit and the public savings thereof, and the credit requested. The credit provided shall not exceed the lesser of the incremental increase in cost to provide the qualified public improvement or the public savings. 
D.  Credits shall only apply against system development charges and shall be apportioned against the property which was subject to the requirement to construct an improvement eligible for credit. 
E.  Sewer reservations purchased under previously imposed ordinances by the city will be recognized under their original terms and conditions. Owners of property who have sewer reservations may transfer them to other properties which they currently own by submitting a written request to the director, provided that such transfer may not result in the gaining property acquiring more reservations than the property may utilize in accordance with current zoning.

1.  Prior to the request for the refund, the city had not expended any funds in planning, designing, or constructing a larger or greater capacity improvement based upon the original scope of the development in question. 
2.  The difference in system development charges between the original scope and reduced scope of the development amounted to at least twenty percent of the system development charge paid or at least five thousand dollars, whichever is less. 
3.  The request for a refund must be submitted in writing to the director within ninety days after payment of the system development charge. The request must state the name and address of the applicant, the location and description of the development, the original scope of the project and the amount of system development charges paid, the reduced scope of the project and the amount of system development charges that would be paid on such reduced scope, and the amount of the refund requested.

12.07.050 - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
A.  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471, and amendments thereto, are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference. 
B.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
C.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
D.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
E.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

12.07.070 - Local limits. 
    No user shall discharge to the POTW wastewater containing pollutants in excess of limitations specified in its wastewater discharge permit, categorical pretreatment standards or other limits established by the city. The city may establish and revise standards for specific substances. The director shall publish and revise, from time to time, local limits for specific restricted substances, temperature, and applicable pH range limitations. These local limits shall be developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5 and shall be applicable to all users. Local limits are usually concentration-based standards and apply at the point where wastewater is discharged from the end of treatment process. The point at which wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of the pipe) will be used when no specific treatment system is in use. Federal categorical pretreatment standards apply at the end of process. The director may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limits. Where an industrial user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply. The city may develop best management practices (BMPs) in lieu of numerical limitations. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.080 - City's right of revision.

12.07.090 - Special agreement. 
    The city may enter into special agreements, or control mechanisms, with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the EPA in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. A special agreement may contain requirements in addition to those specified in this chapter. 
    Nondischarging categorical industrial user (NDCIUs), including NDCIUs with zero-discharge categorical limits, that have a potential to discharge, may be issued a no-discharge control mechanism or annual certification requirement. All significant industrial users shall be controlled via permits or equivalent control mechanisms.

12.07.110 - Dilution. 
    No user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation under any circumstances unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.120 - Pretreatment facilities. 
A.  Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section 12.07.040 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Appeals. 
1.  Users shall have fourteen days to appeal the requirement to provide wastewater pretreatment. 
2.  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.

A.  Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
C.  Industrial dischargers shall provide grease, oil, and sand interceptors for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease, oils, sand, or other harmful constituents in cases where such materials may be discharged into the POTW, such as (but not limited to) food and beverage processing establishments, restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars and clubs, school kitchens, coffee shops, fast food and other eateries, vehicle washing facilities, and vehicle or equipment repair facilities. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city in accordance with the city adopted plumbing codes and shall be installed and connected so as to be easily accessible for cleaning, maintenance, and inspection. For facilities constructed or under construction prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the discharger shall have one year from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter to provide the required interceptor. Interceptor units shall be maintained in continuously efficient operating condition at all times by the user at his expense. Each user will need to determine the adequate maintenance schedule for their interceptor(s), notify the city of the determined maintenance schedule, and keep records verifying the maintenance provided. "Acceptable maintenance" means pumping out the entire interceptor. If at any time, the city finds a user's maintenance schedule is inadequate to provide for efficient operation, the city shall require a more frequent maintenance schedule. 
D.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
E.  Users may be required to install a control manhole, or other sampling device approved by the director, when deemed necessary by the director, to facilitate observation, sampling and flow measurement of the discharge. Such manholes, or other sampling devices approved by the director, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole, or other sampling device approved by the director, shall be installed and maintained by the user at their expense.

12.07.140 - Accidental spill prevention/slug control plans. 
A.  General Provisions. All users, as required by the director, shall provide protection from accidental or intentional discharges of materials, which may interfere with or cause pass through to the POTW, by developing and implementing a slug control/accidental spill prevention plan (ASPP). Facilities necessary to prevent the discharge of prohibited or restricted substances shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An ASPP showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation of the plan. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. The ASPP shall be posted and available for inspection at the facility during normal business hours. 
B.  Specific Provisions. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. 
C.  An accidental spill prevention/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
2.  Description of stored chemicals; 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 12.07.360 of this chapter; 
4.  Procedures for submitting written report within five days of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 12.07.360(B) of this chapter; and

A.  Except as indicated in subsection (B) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow-proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
B.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
C.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical dischargers, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6 (e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable federal pretreatment standards. 
D.  All sample results shall indicate the time, date and location of sampling; methods of analysis, date of and person performing analysis; and a certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, more frequently than what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, user shall submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of user's self-monitoring report. 
E.  The possession and handling of a sample from the time of collection through the time of disposal shall be documented on a chain of custody form. The actual person collecting the sample shall fill out the chain of custody form at the time of sampling. The chain of custody form shall be completed by all persons in possession of the sample until it is ultimately received at an analytical laboratory and disposed of. The chain of custody record shall be retained by the user and shall become part of the analysis documentation. If the user fails to retain proper and complete chain of custody documentation, analysis for the sample in question will be invalidated and the user shall sample again. 
F.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in Sections 12.07.310 and 12.07.330 of this chapter, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical data does not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower number of samples. For the reports required in Section 12.07.340 of this chapter, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

12.07.430 - Record keeping. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established in Section 12.07.070 of this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.

12.07.440 - Right of entry-Inspection and sampling. 
A.  The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
B.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state, or U.S. EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
C.  The city, state, or U.S. EPA shall have the right to inspect and/or install sampling equipment on the user's property, or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
D.  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.450 - Search warrants. 
    If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Troutdale Municipal Court. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.460 - Confidential information. 
A.  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
B.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 403.14 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.470 - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
A.  The director shall publish annually in January, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
B.  The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users, and to any other industrial user that violates subsections (B)(3), (4) or (8) of this section, and shall mean: 
1.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
2.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
3.  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement that the director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
4.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
5.  Failure to meet, within ninety days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
6.  Failure to provide, within thirty days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
7.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
8.  Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

(Ord. No. 807, § 1(Att. A), 5-10-2011) 
12.07.480 - Violation. 
    Any industrial user that violates any of the provisions in this chapter shall be subject to an enforcement action using any of the remedies and sanctions that are authorized in this chapter or state law. The director shall determine which enforcement action to take to address the violation. 
    When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.485 - Termination of sanitary sewer service. 
A.  The director may terminate sanitary sewer service in accordance with subsection B of this section under any of the following circumstances: 
1.  When the utility bill for the sanitary sewer service is delinquent as defined in Section 12.04.060(C); 
2.  When the sanitary sewer service requires a discharge permit in accordance with this chapter and such permit is not obtained; 
3.  When the sanitary sewer service is not operated in accordance with federal and state regulations and the terms and conditions of Chapter 12.04, this chapter or other applicable local requirements, including the requirements of a wastewater discharge permit; 
4.  When the facility serviced by the sanitary sewer service is occupied prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued;

    The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.510 - Compliance orders. 
    When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.520 - Cease and desist orders. 
A.  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
B.  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.530 - Administrative fines. 
A.  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
B.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of twelve percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
C.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
D.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.540 - Emergency suspensions. 
A.  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge and the user's wastewater discharge permit, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
B.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 12.07.550 are initiated against the user. 
C.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Section 12.07.500 or 12.07.550. 
D.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

12.07.550 - Termination of discharge. 
A.  In addition to the provisions in Sections 12.07.280 and 12.07.485, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in Sections 12.07.040 through 12.07.110 of this chapter. 
B.  Such noncompliant user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 12.07.500 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 789 § 1 Att. 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 778 § 1 Att. A (part), 2006) 
12.07.560 - Injunctive relief.

12.07.660 - Upset. 
A.  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
B.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (C) of this section, are met. 
C.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
3.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
D.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
E.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only if an enforcement action is brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
F.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 12.07.040(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Sections 12.07.040(B)(3) through (B)(18) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
A.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
B.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

12.07.680 - Bypass. 
A.  For the purposes of this section: 
1.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
2.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
B.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section. 
C.  Notice of a bypass shall be provided as follows: 
1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four hours. 
D.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section. 
E.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section.

12.07.690 - Wastewater discharge fees. 
A.  There is established a wastewater discharge pretreatment program development fee to be paid by a user creating the need for a pretreatment program. The council shall establish the amount of the fee by resolution and may, from time to time, change the fee amount. The fee that is established by council resolution will be based on the cost the city incurs to develop a pretreatment program, including the establishment of local limits. 
B.  There is established a wastewater discharge permit fee and a wastewater discharge permit application fee, to be paid by each user that is required to obtain a permit under this chapter. The council shall establish the amount of the fees by resolution, and may, from time to time, change the fee amounts. 
1.  The application fee that is established by council resolution will be based on the costs the city incurs for processing applications, writing permits, and processing appeals. 
2.  The permit fee that is established by council resolution will be based on the costs the city incurs to implement and maintain a pretreatment program; develop report formats; monitor inspections; perform surveillance; sample and analyze discharge; review reports from industrial users; investigate complaints; review and respond to accidental discharge procedures and construction; enforce compliance with the provisions in this chapter; and for any other costs the city may incur for activities associated with provisions in this chapter. 
C.  The wastewater discharge pretreatment program development fee, the application fee, and the permit fee imposed in this chapter are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties that are chargeable by the city.

12.08.030 - Local improvement district initiation. 
A.  Creation of a local improvement district may be initiated by the council or by affected property owners. 
B.  Initiation by the Council. Whenever the council deems it expedient to construct, alter, repair, improve, widen or extend any street, alley, sidewalk, parking, curbing or any part thereof, or to construct, alter or install street lights, or to construct, improve or repair any sanitary or storm sewer or waterline or any part thereof, or to acquire, establish, construct or reconstruct any off-street motor vehicle parking facility; or to construct, reconstruct or repair any flood control facility, or to construct, reconstruct, repair or equip a park, playground or neighborhood recreation facility, for which it is anticipated that special assessments will be levied, it shall by motion direct the director to make an investigation of such project and to submit a written report, containing the information hereinafter specified. 
C.  Initiation by Affected Property Owners. Whenever the owners of at least sixty percent of the affected property by area in the proposed district desire to form themselves into a local improvement district, they may by written petition request the council to direct the director to submit a report as hereinafter specified. The petition must be filed with the recorder not less than seven days prior to the meeting of the council which will consider the matter. The council, if satisfied that the petition is signed by the owners of at least sixty percent in area of the affected property within the proposed district, shall pass the requested motion unless by a vote of at least two-thirds of the councilors present, the council deems it not in the public interest to comply with such petition. In determining the public interest, the council may consider the city's comprehensive plan designation for the area to be served and the effect of the improvement on the goals of the community, the credit rating of the city, the level of petitioner investment in the improvement to serve the area, the credit worthiness and bonding capabilities of property in the proposed district, and any other facts deemed significant. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.040 - Local improvement district director's report.

2.  Estimated cost of the work to be done, including any legal, administrative and engineering costs attributable thereto; provided, however, that where the proposed project is to be carried out in cooperation with any other governmental agency, the Director may adopt the estimates of that agency; 
3.  An analysis of the extent to which the proposed improvement benefits the entire city and a recommendation as to the method of determining the project costs that will be borne by the entire city; 
4.  A recommendation as to the method of assessment to be used to arrive at a fair apportionment of the whole or any portion of the cost of the improvement to the properties specially benefited; 
5.  An estimate of the unit assessment cost of the improvement based upon the recommended method of assessment; 
6.  The description and assessed value of each lot, parcel of land, or portion thereof, to be specially benefited by the improvement, with the names of the record owners thereof and, when readily available, the names of the contract purchasers thereof; 
7.  A statement of outstanding assessments against property to be assessed.

(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.050 - Local improvement district approval. 
A.  If the report is approved, the council shall, by resolution, declare its intention to make such improvement, provide the manner and method of carrying out the improvement, and direct the recorder to give notice of the improvement by two publications one week apart in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, or by posting notice at the city hall and at two places within the benefited area, and by mailing copies of the notice to the owners to be assessed for the costs of such improvement. The notice shall be mailed, and posted, at least ten days prior to the public hearing on the proposed improvement. The notice shall contain the following: 
1.  A statement describing the proposed improvement, the area to be served and the district boundary, and the intention of the council to make such an improvement; 
2.  The place and times at which the director's report on the proposed improvement may be examined; 
3.  The date, time and place of the public hearing on the proposed improvement; 
4.  The procedure for presenting objections and remonstrances; 
5.  The estimated total cost of the project or the cost of that portion of the project to be financed by assessments to benefited properties; 
6.  The method of assessment and the estimated unit assessment rate. 
B.  The council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed improvement not less than ten days from the time notice is deposited in the mail. At that hearing, remonstrators and persons favoring the improvement are entitled to be heard. If, prior to or during the hearing, written objections are received from owners representing two-thirds of the area to be assessed, the improvement proceedings shall be abandoned and shall not be subject to a further hearing for at least six months. The council, after receiving objections from owners representing not more than two-thirds of the area to be assessed, may discontinue the proceedings or adopt or amend the director's report and, as amended, adopt the same by resolution. Having by resolution created a local improvement district of the area to be benefited by the proposed improvement, the council shall direct, in the resolution or by subsequent action, the director to prepare detailed plans, specifications and cost estimates for the proposed improvement. 
C.  Following adoption of the project approval resolution, the city may advertise for bids, contract for construction of the improvement, and construct the improvement in accordance with law and the adopted plans and specifications. The city may also construct by contracting with another unit of government. After satisfactory completion of the construction, the director shall prepare a certificate of completion and final estimate showing the total cost. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.060 - Local improvement district assessment. 
A.  Assessments are made following construction of the improvement. The determination shall be based upon actual construction costs and related costs, and the determination of proposed individual and specific property assessments shall be known as the "preliminary assessment roll." 
B.  The council shall establish the date, time and place at which it will meet to equalize and adjust the preliminary assessment roll, and shall direct the city recorder to mail and post or publish the notice of the proposed assessments and hearing for equalization of the assessments in the manner provided by Section 12.08.050A of this code. Notices shall be mailed, published or posted at least ten days prior to the hearing. 
C.  The notice of preliminary assessment shall contain the following: 
1.  A brief description of the improvement; 
2.  The place and times at which the preliminary assessment roll can be examined; 
3.  The date, time and place of the hearing on equalization of proposed assessments; 
4.  The procedure for presenting objections and remonstrances; 
5.  The individual and specific assessment proposed for the property owned by the recipients of the mailed notices. 
D.  The council shall hear all objections and remonstrances at the designated meeting or, failing to hear all objections and remonstrances within a reasonable period of time, shall adjourn the hearing to a time and place designated prior to adjournment. After hearing all objections and remonstrances, the council shall, at the hearing or at subsequent meetings, equalize and spread the proposed assessments. 
E.  The council shall, by ordinance, levy and spread the assessments, such assessment to be then known as the "final assessment roll." Promptly after passage of the ordinance levying the final assessments, the recorder shall send by registered or certified mail a notice of final assessment to all owners of property being assessed. 
    The notice of final assessment shall contain the following: 
1.  A brief description of the improvement; 
2.  The procedure for cash payment or for applying for Bancroft financing; 
3.  The final assessment levied on property owned by the recipient. 
F.  The council, in adopting a method of assessment of the costs of the improvement, may: 
1.  Use any just and reasonable method of determining the extent of any improvement district consistent with the benefits derived; 
2.  Use any method of apportioning the sum to be assessed as is just and reasonable between the properties determined to be specially benefited; 
3.  Authorize payment by the city of all, or any part of, the cost of any such improvement, when in the opinion of the council the topographical or physical conditions, or unusual or excessive public travel, or other character of the work involved warrants only a partial payment or no payment by the benefited property of the costs of the improvement. 
G.  In the event that an assessment shall be made before the total cost of the improvement is ascertained, and if it is found that the amount of the assessment is insufficient to defray the expenses of the improvement, the council may, by ordinance, declare such deficit and prepare a proposed deficit assessment. The council shall set a time for a hearing of objections to such deficit assessment and shall direct the city recorder to publish one notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. After such hearing the council shall make a just and equitable deficit assessment by ordinance, which shall be entered in the docket of city liens as provided by this chapter, and notices of the deficit assessment shall be published and mailed and the collection of the assessment shall be made in accordance with applicable sections of this chapter. 
H.  To the extent consistent with the provisions of this chapter, ORS 223.317 to ORS 223.485 on assessment, reassessment, and apportionment of assessment applies to assessments by the city. 
I.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall preclude the council from using any other available means of financing improvements, including federal or state grants in aid, user charges or fees, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, or any other legal means of finance. In the event that such other means of financing improvements are used, the council may, in its discretion, levy special assessments according to the benefits derived to cover any remaining part of the costs of the improvement. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.070 - Local improvement district objections and remedies. 
    Subject to the curative provisions of this chapter, and the rights of the city to reassess as provided in this chapter, proceedings for writs of review and suits in equity may be filed not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the filing of written objections as provided in this chapter. A property owner who has filed written objections with the city recorder prior to the public hearing may have the right to apply for a writ of review based upon the city council exercising its functions erroneously or arbitrarily or exceeding its jurisdiction to the injury of some substantial right of such owner if the facts supporting such claim have been specifically set forth in the written objections. A property owner who has filed written objections with the city recorder prior to the public hearing may commence a suit for equitable relief based upon a total lack of jurisdiction on the part of the city; and if notice of the improvement shall not have been sent to the owner and if the owner did not have actual knowledge of the proposed improvement prior to the hearing, then the owner may file written objections alleging lack of jurisdiction with the city recorder within thirty days after receiving notice or knowledge of the improvement. No provision of this section shall be construed so as to lengthen any period of redemption or so as to affect the running of any statute of limitation. Any proceeding on a writ of review or suit in equity shall be abated if proceedings are commenced and diligently pursued by the city council to remedy or cure the alleged errors or defects. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.080 - Local improvement district liens and foreclosure proceedings. 
    After passage of the assessment ordinance by the city council, the city recorder shall enter in the docket of city liens a statement of the amounts assessed upon each particular lot, parcel of land or portion thereof, together with a description of the improvement, the name of the owners and the date of the assessment ordinance. Upon such entry in the lien docket, the amount so entered shall become a lien and charge upon the respective lots, parcels of land or portions thereof, which have been assessed for such improvements. All assessment liens of the city shall be superior and prior to all other liens and encumbrances on property insofar as the laws of the state permit. Interest shall be charged on all amounts not paid within thirty days from the date of the assessment ordinance. The interest rate charged shall be equal to the true interest rate of the bonds sold to finance the improvements plus one percent to pay a proportionate part of the cost of administering the bond assessment program. Upon expiration of thirty days from the date of such assessment ordinance, the city may proceed to foreclose or enforce collection of the assessment liens in the manner provided by the general laws of the state; provided, however, that the city may, at its option, enter a bid for the property being offered at a foreclosure sale, which bid shall be prior to all bids except those made by persons who would be entitled under the laws of the state to redeem such property. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.090 - Local improvement district abandonment of proceedings. 
    The council shall have full power and authority to abandon and rescind proceedings for improvements made under this chapter at any time prior to the final completion of such improvements. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.100 - Local improvement district curative provisions. 
A.  No improvement assessment shall be rendered invalid by reason of a failure of the director's report to contain all of the information required by this chapter, or by reason of a failure to have all of the information required to be in the improvement resolution, the assessment ordinance, the lien docket or notices required to be published and mailed, nor by the failure to list the name of, or mail notice to, the owner of any property as required by this chapter, or by reason of any other error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity or other act, jurisdictional or otherwise, in any of the proceedings or steps specified in this chapter, unless it appears that the assessment is unfair or unjust in its effect upon the person complaining; and the council shall have the power and authority to remedy and correct all such matters by suitable action and proceedings. 
B.  Whenever any assessment, deficit or reassessment for any improvement which has been made by the city has been, or shall be, set aside, annulled, declared or rendered void, or its enforcement restrained by any court of the state, or any federal court having jurisdiction thereof, or when the council may make a reassessment in the manner provided by the laws of the state. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.110 - Bancroft bonding. 
    The provisions of Oregon Revised Statutes Sections 223.205 through 223.295 known as Bancroft Bonding Act are adopted and made a part of this section by reference. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998: Ord. 600-94-O (part), 1994) 
12.08.200 - Purpose of reimbursement district. 
    The purpose of a reimbursement district is to provide a method to reimburse the city or a person who finances the construction of a sewer, water, stormwater or street improvement in whole or in part for the cost of those improvements which benefit other properties. It is intended to be used to mitigate the cost of financing such public improvements by distributing those costs to other benefited property owners at the time those benefited property owners connect to or make use of the improvements. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998) 
12.08.210 - Reimbursement district initiation. 
A.  Any person who chooses or is required as a condition of a development or building permit approval to construct a public street, water, sanitary sewer or stormwater improvement which will or could provide service to property other than property owned by the person may apply to the city to form a reimbursement district. The street, water, sanitary sewer or stormwater improvements must include improvements located off-site or in a size greater than those which would otherwise ordinarily be required in connection with an application for development or building permit approval. The city may also initiate formation of a reimbursement district for city financed water, sanitary sewer, street and stormwater improvements. 
B.  The application for a reimbursement district shall be in writing and filed with the director, and shall be accompanied by a processing fee established by council resolution, sufficient to cover the administrative review and notice costs of processing an application. 
C.  The application shall include the following: 
1.  A description of the location, type, size and estimated cost of the public improvement to be eligible for reimbursement. 
2.  A map showing the properties to be included in the proposed reimbursement district; the land use designation for each of the properties; the front footage and square footage of each of the properties, or similar data necessary for calculating the apportionment of the costs; and the properties owned by the applicant. 
3.  A proposed methodology for spreading costs amongst the benefited properties. 
4.  The estimated cost of the improvements as evidenced by bids, projections of the cost of labor and materials, or other evidence satisfactory to the director. 
5.  The estimated date of completion of the public improvements. 
D.  The application for formation of a reimbursement district must be made prior to city approval of construction plans and authorization to proceed with the construction of the street, water, sewer or stormwater improvements. The applicant may proceed with the construction of the improvements prior to council authorizing the reimbursement district. If the council does not authorize the reimbursement district, the applicant will be responsible for the full cost of the improvement. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998) 
12.08.220 - Reimbursement district director's report. 
    The director shall review the application for the establishment of a reimbursement district and recommend whether a district should be established. The director may request the submittal of other relevant information from the applicant in order to assist in the evaluation. The director shall prepare a written report for the council that: 
A.  Recommends whether or not the reimbursement district should be formed; 
B.  Explains whether the applicant will finance or has financed some or all of the cost of a street, water, sewer or stormwater improvement, thereby making service available to property, other than property owned by the applicant; 
C.  Recommends the area to be included in reimbursement district; 
D.  States the estimated cost of the street, water, sewer or stormwater improvements within the area of the proposed reimbursement district and the portion of the cost for which the applicant should be reimbursed. The cost to be reimbursed to the applicant shall be limited to the cost of engineering, design and construction surveying, construction, acquisition and condemnation costs of acquiring the additional easements and right-of-way, the cost of permits, engineering and legal expenses and the processing fee. The applicant for formation of the reimbursement district shall not be reimbursed for the portion of the reimbursement charge computed for the property of the applicant or for any improvements that are not dedicated to and accepted by the city as a public improvement. 
E.  Recommends a just and reasonable methodology for spreading the cost among the parcels within the reimbursement district. 
F.  Recommends the amount to be charged by the city for administration of the agreement by the city. The administration fee shall be fixed by the council and will be included in the resolution approving and forming the reimbursement district. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998) 
12.08.230 - Reimbursement district approval. 
A.  The council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed reimbursement district at which time any person may comment on the proposal. 
B.  Because formation of the reimbursement district does not result in an assessment against property or lien against property, the process is not subject to mandatory termination because of remonstrances. The council has the sole discretion after the public hearing to decide whether a resolution approving and forming the reimbursement district shall be adopted. 
C.  The city shall provide mailed notice of the public hearing on the proposal to the applicant and all owners of property within the proposed district as shown on the most recent county assessor's assessment roll. Notice shall be deemed effective on the date of mailing. Failure of the applicant or any affected owner to receive the notice shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the public hearing or the formation of the reimbursement district. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed by regular mail at least fourteen days before the date of the hearing. The notice shall: 
1.  State that a reimbursement district has been proposed that includes the property of the person receiving notice; 
2.  Briefly describe the reimbursement district, the street, water, sewer or stormwater improvement to be reimbursed, the estimated amount of the reimbursement charge, and the circumstances under which the charge must be paid; 
3.  Include a copy of the director's report; 
4.  State the time, date, and place of the public hearing. 
D.  After the public hearing is held, the council shall approve, reject or modify the recommendations contained in the director's report. If a reimbursement district is established, the council shall pass a resolution establishing the area included in the reimbursement district, the estimated cost of the improvements, the methodology for allocating the costs among the parcels, the estimated cost borne by each parcel, and the administrative fee charged by the city. 
E.  A right to reimbursement shall terminate ten years after the reimbursement district is created. 
F.  When the applicant is other than the city, the resolution shall instruct the director to enter into an agreement with the applicant pertaining to the reimbursement district improvements. The agreement, at a minimum, shall contain the following provisions: 
1.  The public improvements shall meet all applicable city standards; 
2.  The total amount of potential reimbursement to the applicant; 
3.  The applicant shall guarantee the public improvements for a period of twenty-four months after the date of acceptance for ownership and operation; 
4.  The applicant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all losses, claims, damage, judgments or other costs or expense arising as a result of or related to the city's establishment of the district; 
5.  The applicant shall acknowledge that the city is not obligated to collect the reimbursement fee from affected property owners; 
6.  Other provisions as the council determines necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 657 Att. A (part), 1998) 
12.08.240 - Reimbursement district assessment. 
A.  After the project is completed, the applicant shall submit to the city the final costs of the improvement.

Whenever the user's installation, operation, maintenance, removal, reinstallation, replacement or relocation of equipment damages or disturbs the right-of-way, user, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly repair and return the right-of-way to the condition it was in before it was damaged or disturbed, as approved by the public works director. If user does not repair the right-of-way to at least the condition that existed prior to construction within the time frame given in the permit or as otherwise agreed to by the city, then the city may, upon fifteen days' (or less if public safety requires) prior written notice to user, repair the right-of-way at user's sole expense. Upon the receipt of a demand for payment from the city, user shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within sixty days. 
H.  Use by City. The city, at its cost, may install pipes or conduit in any trench or excavation created by user, to the extent that such space therein or thereon is reasonably available.

The person or persons that requested the move shall pay all direct damages caused directly by the changing, altering, moving, removing or replacing of such wires, cables or other plant, except for damages and claims that are the direct result of user's negligent acts. Except in an emergency, user shall be given not less than thirty days' written notice by the party desiring to move such building or other objects. Such notice shall detail the route of movement of such buildings or other objects over and along the streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways of the city.

The city shall provide user with prompt notice of any such claim, which user shall defend. No settlement or compromise of any such claim will be done by the city or the user without the prior written approval of the other party.

The city shall not unreasonably withhold such agreement. If user fails to remove equipment that is no longer going to be used, and the city has not agreed to allow user to abandon such equipment in place, the city may remove the equipment at user's sole expense.

Street trees shall be regulated as provided in applicable sections of this chapter. 
B.  The requirements of this section apply only to trees having a trunk six inches or more in diameter, maximum cross section, measured at a point four and one-half feet above the ground on the upslope side of the tree. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. 
C.  No person shall remove a tree from undeveloped or underdeveloped property without first obtaining a tree removal permit from the director pursuant to this section. No tree removal permit is required to remove trees on developed property. 
D.  An application for a tree removal permit in conjunction with a land use permit shall be considered as part of the land use permit and shall be subject to the application, notice, hearing and appeal procedures applicable to the proposed development pursuant to the Troutdale Development Code. An application for any land use permit shall show trees regulated by this section on a site plan. A tree removal permit may be granted in the following circumstances: 
1.  If a tree is diseased, hazardous, in danger of falling, in close proximity to existing structures or proposed construction, or interferes with utility services or pedestrian or vehicular traffic safety; 
2.  If the tree removal will have no significant impact on erosion, soil retention, stability of earth, flow and character of surface waters and streams, protection of nearby trees and windbreaks; and, if the tree removal will have no significant impact on the environmental quality of the area, including scenic and wildlife habitat values; 
3.  If the tree removal is necessary in order to construct reasonably required improvements; or 
4.  If, in the opinion of the fire marshal, tree removal is necessary to protect existing or proposed structures. 
E.  An application for a tree removal permit not in conjunction with a land use permit shall be processed pursuant to the Type II procedure, with appeal rights as set forth in the Troutdale Development Code, and shall be permitted on a limited basis consistent with the preservation of the site's future development potential and consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  Wooded areas associated with natural drainage-ways and water areas shall be retained to preserve riparian habitat and to minimize erosion; 
2.  Wooded areas that will likely provide an attractive on-site amenity to occupants of future development shall be retained; 
3.  Wooded areas along ridgelines and hilltops shall be retained for their scenic and wildlife habitat values; 
4.  Wooded areas along property lines shall be retained to provide buffers from adjacent properties; 
5.  Trees shall be retained in sufficiently large areas and dense stands so as to ensure against windthrow; 
6.  Clear cuts of developable areas shall be avoided so as to retain a wooded character of future building sites, and to preserve housing and design options for future city residents.

The administrative enforcement fee for inspection violations shall be established by Troutdale city council resolution.

approximate the bankfull stage. The bankfull stage is the starting point for measuring the
width of a vegetation corridor from a protected water feature. In the absence of any data
to establish the bankfull stage or two-year storm event, the starting point for measuring
the vegetation corridor is determined by the following indicators:
a. Water marks on fixed objects (vegetation, rocks, buildings, etc.);

Chapter 2  Procedures for Decision-Making
2.005 Types of Procedures for Taking Public Action. Three separate procedures are established for
processing development applications and one procedure is established for public actions
(legislative) which do not involve land use permits or require consideration of a plan
amendment, land use regulation, or City policies. These are Types I-III and Type IV
respectively (see Table below):
DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURE
Type I Procedure Type II Procedure
 Ministerial permits and actions
 Clear and objective criteria
 No public notice or hearing required
 Some discretion based on Code criteria
 Public notice
Type III Procedure Type IV Procedure
 Complex or subjective decisions of
predominantly discretionary
approval criteria
 Public hearing
 Legislative decisions
 Creation, revision, or large-scale
implementation of public policy
 Public hearing
2.010 Procedures for Processing Permits.
A. An application shall be processed under a Type I, II, III, or IV procedure as they are
described in Sections 2.050 to 2.065 of this Chapter. The differences between the
procedures are generally associated with the different nature of the decisions as described
in the table in Section 2.005 of this Chapter.
B. When an application and proposed development is submitted, the Director shall
determine the type of procedure the Code specifies for its processing and the potentially
affected agencies. When there is a question as to the appropriate type of procedure, or if
the Director contemplates that persons being notified of the application can be expected
to question the applications compliance with the Code, the application proposal shall be
processed under the higher type procedure. An application shall be processed under the
highest numbered procedure required for any part of the development proposal.
C. When an application will potentially have a significant effect on a County or State
roadway/transportation facility, Multnomah County or ODOT shall be invited to
participate in the pre-application conference, if one is held, and shall be notified when the

3 Vegetation corridors in excess of 50 feet for primary protected water features, or in excess of 15
feet for secondary protected water features, apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from
the protected water feature.
4 Where the protected water feature is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of the ravine is the
break in the slope that is =25% (see Figures 4 and 5 in Section 4.317 of this Chapter). If a slope of
=25% continues beyond 200 feet, the development standards of this Chapter continue to apply
until the break in slope.
5 A maximum reduction of 25 feet may be permitted in the width of vegetation corridor beyond the
break in slope if a geotechnical report demonstrates that the slope is stable. To establish the width
of the vegetation corridor, measure in 25-foot increments from the minimum setback away from
the water feature until the slope is less than 25% (top or ravine).

Advantages:
1. Provides protection for slopes of twenty-five percent (25%) and greater, yet corridor
widths can be varied to fit a number of different situations. Development on slopes in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%) beyond the vegetation corridor as determined by the
table in Section 4.316, Width of Vegetation Corridor, of this Chapter and the proceeding
methods, are still protected under the provisions of this Chapter pursuant to Section
4.311, Applicability, of this Chapter.
2. Provides flexibility. The end point will be unique for each property based upon an actual
topographical survey.
4.318 Delineation of Habitat Conservation Areas. Habitat Conservation Areas (HCAs) are generally
shown on the Metro Title 13 maps. For purposes of development within the HCAs on Cityowned
and Metro-owned parks and greenspaces, delineation of on-the-ground HCA
boundaries shall be done by a professional and verified by the City of Troutdale using the best
available information.

4.400 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PD
4.410 Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide more flexibility in the development of land;
encourage variety and creativity in the development pattern of the community; conserve
natural land features; facilitate aesthetic and efficient use of open space; create public and
private open space; encourage the application of new techniques and technology to
community development which contribute to superior living or development patterns; use land
efficiently in order to reduce the costs of housing, maintenance, street systems, and utility
networks; promote energy conservation and crime prevention; and relate development to the
natural environment and its users.
4.411 Permitted Uses.
A. For Residential Districts.
1. Uses permitted in the underlying district.
2. Housing concepts may include, but are not limited to, single-family residences,
duplexes, rowhouses, townhouses, cluster units, multiple-family dwellings, or
mobile homes.
3. Related commercial uses as part of the development.
4. Related community service uses designed to serve the development.
5. Accessory buildings and uses.
B. For Commercial and Industrial Districts.
1. Uses permitted in the underlying district.
2. Community service uses.
3. Accessory buildings and uses.
4.412 Areas of Application. Commercial, Industrial, and Residential. Planned Development
approval may be sought for uses allowed in the underlying zone. Creation of lots or parcels
shall be governed by Chapter 7, Land Divisions, except as expressly provided for herein.
4.413 Dimensional Standards.
A. Lot Width, Depth, and Frontage Requirements. Minimum lot size, width, depth, and
frontage requirements for lots in a Planned Development may be less than the minimums
specified in the underlying district if in accordance with the approved general plan and
program, and the density standards of this Chapter.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 4  Zoning District Overlays
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 4-29 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
B. Minimum Site Size. A Planned Development shall be established on a parcel of land that
is suitable for the proposed development, and shall not be established on less than two (2)
acres of contiguous land
4.414 General Requirements.
A. Peripheral Setbacks. Peripheral yards of a Planned Development site shall be at least as
deep as those required by the yard regulations of the adjoining district, unless the
Planning Commission finds that equal protection will be accorded through specific
features of the approved plan.
B. Open Space.
1. Open space in a Planned Development means the land area to be used for scenic,
landscaping, or open recreational purposes within the development. It shall not
include street right-of-ways, driveways, or open parking areas.
2. Adequate open space shall be provided for the recreational and leisure use of the
individuals occupying the Planned Development, and designed to enhance the
development.
3. To the maximum extent practicable, natural features of the land shall be preserved
and landscaping provided.
4. In order to assure that open space will be permanent, dedication of development
rights to the City may be required.
5. Instruments guaranteeing the maintenance of open space shall be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission. Documents dedicating development rights
and provisions for maintenance of open space shall be approved as to form by the
City Attorney.
6. The Planning Commission may require that instruments of conveyance provide
that in the event the open space is permitted to deteriorate, or is not maintained in
a condition consistent with the approved plan, the City may, at its option, cause
such maintenance to be done and assess the costs to the affected property owners.
C. Residential Density.
1. In a residential Planned Development, the density permitted is the same as that of
cumulative number of dwellings permitted by the underlying district or districts,
except for the A-2 zoning district, which shall be based on the density per
dwelling unit established in Goal 2 of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the
High Density Residential Planning area.
a. Density shall be allowed consistent with the general plan and program
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 4  Zoning District Overlays
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 4-30 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
throughout the Planned Development area without regard to zoning district
boundaries.
b. In a mixed-use Planned Development, the number of allowable units is based
on net residential area. The net residential area for a Planned Development
shall be calculated by taking the total area of the development less streets,
commercial, industrial, community service, and other non-residential uses;
area constrained for development under the provisions of this Code; and any
existing residential uses that are being retained as part of the Planned
Development. Recreational trails, open space, etc., shall be included in the
net residential area, unless these open spaces are preserved and protected
through conditions, covenants, and restrictions; conservation easements; or
where approved by the City Council, dedication, or conveyance to the City.
The number of dwelling units permitted in a Planned Development shall be
calculated by dividing the net residential area by the minimum lot size
required in the underlying residential district or districts, except for the A-2
zoning district which shall be a minimum of two thousand (2,000) square feet
per dwelling unit.
c. Outside of the Town Center Overlay District in a commercial or industrial
zoning district, when limited residential use is determined to be appropriate
by the Planning Commission, there is no minimum or maximum density, but
density will be allowed consistent with an approved development plan.
2. Greenways, streams, and steep topography areas will be counted as contributing
to the net area only to the extent that it can be shown, through a Planning
Commission review, that a typical development could be accommodated on the
site with realistic street configuration, grades, and standard lot sizes. The number
of dwellings yielded from such a tentative subdivision review process shall be
used as a base in determining the overall density for the site.
3. An increase of up to twenty five percent (25%) in the number of dwelling units
beyond the maximum density of the underlying zone or zones may be permitted
upon a finding by the Planning Commission that such increased density will
contribute to:
a. Satisfaction of the need for additional urban area housing of the type
proposed;
b. The provision of housing which is convenient to commercial, employment,
and community services and opportunities;
c. The creation of a land use pattern which is complementary to the community
and its identity, and to the community design process;
d. The conservation of energy;
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 4  Zoning District Overlays
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 4-31 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
e. The efficient use of transportation facilities; and
f. The effective use of land and available utilities and facilities.
D. Staging.
1. The applicant may elect to develop the site in successive stages in a manner
indicated in the development plan. Unless otherwise provided in the Planned
Development approval, each such stage shall be substantially complete within
itself. Unless otherwise provided in the Planned Development approval, each
stage is subject to the time limits provided for in Chapter 7 for preliminary and
final subdivision plats.
2. The Planning Commission may require that development be done in stages if
public facilities are not adequate to service the entire development initially.
4.417 Planned Development Process. Planned Development shall be reviewed in the same two (2)
stage process as provided for a Type III subdivision, regardless of whether a land division is
proposed.
4.419 Preliminary Plan.
A. Submission Requirements. The preliminary plan shall consist of twenty (20) copies of all
plans, maps, and diagrams drawn in sufficient detail to indicate the nature of the plan
elements and a written narrative description.
B. Submission Materials. The tentative plan need not be a finished drawing, but it should
present all relevant graphic data, drawn on a sheet 18"x24" in size, and at a scale of
1"=100'. The information shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Proposed land uses and residential densities.
2. Building types and locations.
3. Means of access, circulation, and parking.
4. Parks, playgrounds, paths, and open spaces.
5. Land division plan if the land is to be divided.

instruments acceptable to the City setting forth a plan for the permanent care and
maintenance of common space, including streets and greenways, recreational
areas, and all community-owned facilities.
10. General timetable of development.
4.421 Final Plan. Final plan approval shall be a Type I process to confirm that it is consistent with
the approved preliminary plan. The final plan may be approved notwithstanding minor
changes such as minor shifting of the location of buildings, proposed streets, public or private
ways, utility easements, parks, public open spaces, or other features of the preliminary plan
based on final engineering, design or similar final detail work but shall not increase the
residential densities, change zone boundaries or the perimeter boundary of the PD, change any
use or change the location of amount of land devoted to a use specified in the preliminary
plan. Changes other than permitted minor changes shall require a new application.
A. All public site dedications, development rights to open spaces, or other dedications for
the entire site or approved staged portion shall be recorded prior to the issuance of any
building permit.
B. Final copies of all approved articles governing operation and maintenance shall be placed
on file with the Planning Division prior to the issuance of any building permit.

4.610 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this district is to encourage the downtown Troutdale area
to grow as a diverse and viable town center. The Troutdale Town Center is envisioned as the
district that provides shopping, employment, cultural, and recreational opportunities that serve
the Troutdale area. In addition, the district allows for continued housing opportunities close to
commercial activities. The intent of specific design standards for buildings, streetscapes, and
parking within the TC district is to achieve development that is consistent with the design
concepts outlined in the Town Center Plan. These design concepts include, but are not limited
to, attractive pedestrian-oriented streets, providing a complementary mix of commercial and
residential development, a connected network of streets and accessways to reduce automobile
dependency, and avoiding walled streets.
4.620 Permitted and Conditional Uses. Permitted and conditional uses are the same as those listed in
the underlying zoning districts with the following exceptions:

Troutdale Development Code Chapter 4  Zoning District Overlays
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 4-36 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
B. Minimum Density. Residential development is required to be built at eighty percent
(80%) or more of the maximum number of dwelling units per net acre. For purposes of
this standard, in computing the maximum number of dwelling units, if the total contains a
fraction, then the number shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number. For
computing the minimum number of dwelling units, if the total contains a fraction, then
the number shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number.
[Example: Computing maximum and minimum dwelling units for a five thousand (5,000)
square foot parcel:
 Allowed density is 1 dwelling per 2,000 square feet.
 A 5,000 square foot parcel yields 2.5 dwelling units; round down to 2 dwelling units
for maximum number of units.
 Eighty percent minimum density is 0.8x2 which yields 1.6 dwelling units; rounded
down to 1 dwelling unit for minimum number of units.

5.300 NONCONFORMING USES
5.305 Purpose and Intent. Within the zoning districts established by this Code, or amendments that
may later be adopted, there may exist lots, uses, structures, or other developments of the land
which were lawful before this Code was adopted or amended, but because of the application
of this Code, they no longer conform to the provisions and standards of the district in which
they are located or of this Code in general. This Chapter provides for the regulation of these
legal nonconforming lots, uses, structures, and developments and specifies those
circumstances, conditions, and procedures under which such nonconformities shall be
permitted to continue and expand. It is the intent of this Chapter to permit legal
nonconforming lots, uses, structures, or developments to continue until they are removed by
economic forces or otherwise. Legal nonconforming lots, uses, structures, or developments
may also be expanded or reconstructed as provided in this Code.
5.310 Reconstruction of a Damaged Residential Nonconforming Use. A residential nonconforming
use, or a structure containing a residential nonconforming use, that has been damaged by any
cause may be reconstructed provided a building permit to reconstruct the structure is obtained
within one (1) year of the destruction and further the reconstruction is completed within one
(1) year of commencing construction. Notwithstanding the requirements of construction in
the Flood Management Area, Section 1.040 and Section 4.500. If reconstruction does not
occur within these timeframes, the nonconforming use shall be considered terminated and
shall not be reestablished.
5.315 Reconstruction or Destruction of a Non-Residential Nonconforming Use.
A. A non-residential nonconforming use or a structure containing a non- residential
nonconforming use that has been damaged by any cause to an extent the reconstruction
costs are less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the real market value may be
reconstructed provided a building permit to reconstruct the structure is obtained within
one (1) year of the destruction and further the reconstruction is completed within one (1)
year of commencing construction. Notwithstanding the requirements of construction in a
flood plain, Section 1.040 and Section 4.500. If reconstruction does not occur within
these timeframes, the nonconforming use shall be considered terminated and shall not be
reestablished.
B. When a non-residential nonconforming use, or a structure containing a non-residential
nonconforming use, is damaged by any cause to an extent the reconstruction costs would
equal or exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the real market value as indicated by the
records of the County Assessor, the nonconforming use or structure containing the
nonconforming use shall be considered terminated and shall not be reestablished.
Reconstruction costs shall be based on the cost to restore the use or structure to meet
current building Code and development Code standards, not simply the cost to restore the
use or structure to the condition it existed in prior to it being destroyed.
5.320 Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use. When a nonconforming use or any part thereof is
discontinued for a period of at least twelve (12) months, the nonconforming use or part
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 5  Miscellaneous Uses, Standards, and Exceptions
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 5-11 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
thereof shall be considered terminated and further use of the property upon which the use or
part thereof was located shall conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located. Discontinuance of the use shall be determined by information such as termination of
any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use has occupied the site;
discontinuation of water or electric services; expiration of business license; absence of any
outwardly visible activity associated with the nonconforming use; demolition or removal of a
structure in which the nonconforming use is located; or similar indications that the use or
occupancy has ceased. When a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the
nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
5.325 Expansion of a Nonconforming Structure or Development. A structure conforming as to use
but nonconforming as to height, setback, or similar dimensional standards, or development of
property conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to parking, landscaping, architectural
features, or similar standards, may be expanded provided the expansion does not increase the
degree of nonconformity. A land use permit not otherwise required by this Code is not
required to expand a nonconforming structure or development if the expansion does not
increase the degree of nonconformity.
5.330 Reconstruction of a Damaged Nonconforming Structure or Development. A structure
conforming as to use but nonconforming as to height, setback, or similar dimensional
standards, or a development of property conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to
parking, landscaping, architectural features, or similar standards, that has been damaged by
any cause may be reconstructed if the reconstruction costs are less than seventy-five percent
(75%) of the real market value as indicated by the records of the County Assessor, except if
the non-conforming structure is a residential structure it may be reconstructed regardless of
the reconstruction costs. Reconstruction costs shall be based on the cost to restore the
structure or development to meet current Building Code and development Code standards, not
simply the cost to reconstruct the structure or development to the condition it existed in prior
to it being damaged. Reconstruction shall begin within twelve (12) months of the date the
damage was done and shall be completed within twelve (12) months of the date the
reconstruction began. Notwithstanding the requirements of construction in the Flood
Management Area, Section 1.040 and Section 4.500. If reconstruction does not occur within
these timeframes, the nonconforming structure or development shall be considered terminated
and shall not be reestablished.
5.335 Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure or Development. When a structure conforming as
to use but nonconforming as to height, setback, or similar dimensional standards, or a
development of property conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to parking, landscaping,
architectural features, or similar standards, is damaged by any cause to an extent the
reconstruction costs would equal or exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the real market

by the minimum lot size required in the underlying residential district or districts.
2. Greenways, streams, and steep topography areas will be counted as contributing
to the density only to the extent that it can be shown, through a Planning
Commission review, that a typical development could be accommodated on the
site with realistic street configurations, grades, and standard lot sizes. The number
of dwellings yielded from such a tentative subdivision review process shall be
used as a base in determining the overall density for the site.
3. An increase of up to twenty percent (20%) in the number of dwelling units may
be permitted upon a finding by the Planning Commission that such increased
density will contribute to:

difficulties, for reason of topography or other conditions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this Code.
b. The lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of this
Code. When lots are more than double the minimum required area for the
zoning district, the applicant may be required to arrange such lots to allow
further subdivision and the opening of future streets to serve such potential
lots.
c. The lot width at the front building line shall meet the requirements of this
Code and shall abut a public street other than an alley for a width of at
least twenty (20) feet. A street frontage of not less than fifteen (15) feet is
acceptable in the case of a flag (panhandle) parcel resulting from the

independent of any sanitary sewer system. Surface water drainage systems
shall be approved by the Director of Public Works.
b. Culverts or other drainage facilities shall be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from the upstream drainage area, whether inside or
outside of the development, that drains to the subject property. The
Director of Public Works shall approve the size of the facility assuming
conditions of maximum potential watershed development permitted by
this Code.
c. Where additional runoff generated by the development will overload an
existing drainage facility, approval of the land division may be withheld
until provisions have been made for improvement of said potential
condition.
d. A drainage easement shall be required when:
i. Topography or other conditions make it infeasible to include public
drainage facilities within existing or proposed public right- of-ways.
The easement must provide an area at least fifteen (15) feet in width
and include vehicular access to the easement area from a public street.

System Plan. The Director of Public Works must approve the construction
drawings.
c. Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the
topography, permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and require the
minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe
access to property. Where the length or design of the street allows or
promotes excessive speeds, traffic management measures such as speed
humps and traffic circles are encouraged and may be required, if needed,
to ensure the safe operation of the street. Local street design shall provide
for adequate sight distance at all cross streets and accessway junctions.
d. In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walkways and parking areas to minimize conflict

street connection: constrained slope (fifteen percent [15%] or
more), presence of a wetland or other body of water which cannot
be bridged or crossed, existing development on adjacent property
prevents a street connection, or presence of a freeway, limited
access highway, or railroad.
ii. An accessway is provided consistent with the standards for
accessways.
iii. Cul-de-sacs shall be as short as practicable and shall not exceed
two hundred (200) feet in length as measured to the terminus of the
cul-de-sac street, except where prevented by topography, barriers
such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as
major streams and rivers that would make the dwelling unit
limitation and the street length limitation impractical.
A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent deadend
street in accordance with the Citys construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall serve no more than

A. Number and Placement.
1. At least one pedestrian walkway shall be provided to each street, other than
limited access freeways, abutting the property.
2. Pedestrian walkways shall reasonably connect building entrances to one another,
to public street entrances, and/or to existing or planned transit stops.
3. Where practicable, on-site walkways shall connect with walkways, sidewalks,
bike paths, alleyways, and other bicycle or pedestrian connections on adjacent
properties used as, or planned for, industrial parks, commercial, multiple-family,
or community service uses.
4. Where practicable, pedestrian walkways and driveways shall provide a direct
connection to walkways and driveways on abutting developments.
5. A required walkway or walkway connection need not be provided where another
required sidewalk or walkway route provides a reasonably direct alternate route.
An alternate route is reasonably direct if the walking distance increases by less
than fifty percent (50%) over the other required route.
6. Pedestrian walkways are required between those parts of a site that people on the
site normally would walk between. Walkways are not required between buildings
or portions of a site which are not intended for, or likely to be used by,

As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 8-3 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
8.040 Transit Facility Design. Any Type II land divisions where further divisions are possible, and
all Type III land divisions, multiple-family developments, community services uses, and
commercial or industrial uses located on an existing or future transit route shall meet the
requirements of TriMet for transit facilities. Applicants shall consult with TriMet to determine
necessary transit facility improvements in conjunction with the proposed development.
Proposals shall be consistent with the road crossing improvements that are identified in the
City Transportation System Plan on streets with existing or planned transit service.
8.045 Additional Transit Related Design Standards. All commercial and community service
development, and any industrial development designed to accommodate fifty (50) or more
employees and located on parcels within six hundred (600) feet of existing or planned transit
routes shall meet the following requirements:
A. Building Entrances.
1. Where practicable, buildings shall be oriented on the property in a transit friendly
manner. At least one (1) building entrance shall be oriented toward the transit
street and shall be accessed from a public sidewalk. Public sidewalks shall be
provided adjacent to public streets along the street frontage.
2. Buildings within thirty (30) feet of the transit street shall have an entrance for
pedestrians directly from the street to the building interior. This entrance shall be
designed to be attractive and functional, and shall be open to the public during all
business hours.
3. All uses in commercial zones must provide a public entrance on the façade of a
building nearest to, and facing, a transit street or route. If the lot has frontage on
more than one (1) transit street, the building need only have one (1) entrance
oriented to a transit street, or to the corner where two (2) transit streets intersect.
B. Setbacks. Buildings shall be setback no more than fifty (50) feet from a transit street,
except that when a building is adjacent to a transit street that has a major transit stop
within five hundred (500) feet of the building entrance, the building shall be setback no
more than twenty (20) feet from the transit street. Where the site is adjacent to more than
one (1) transit street, a building is required to meet the maximum setback standard on
only one (1) of the streets. Industrial development as described within this Section are
exempt from this particular provision.
C. As alternative to meeting the requirements in Subsection (A), a development proposal
may incorporate the following design features through the design review process in such
combination that the City may conclude the access for pedestrians, transit riders, and
bicyclists to the development is as good as or better than if the building fronted a major
transit route.
1. The building incorporates two (2) entrances, one (1) that provides direct access to
the transit street, in addition to an entrance that fronts a parking lot.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 8  Site Orientation and Design Standards
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 8-4 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
2. The development proposes additional sidewalk amenities and width which allow
the City to conclude that use of sidewalks is no less inviting than if a main
building entrance fronted on a major transit route. Any additional sidewalk
amenities will not prohibit future building modifications that move a buildings
main façade or main pedestrian access to a point on a major transit route. To
qualify, an applicant must submit drawings of alternative designs that demonstrate
future building modifications can comply with Subsection (A), above.
3. The proposal will construct one (1) or more onsite of offsite multi-use path
connections that connect the building to existing or planned multi-use pedestrian
and trail systems. These systems include, but are not limited to, current and future
pedestrian or bicycle transit paths, or portions of the 40-mile trail loop and the
Beaver Creek Trail. Such connection must invite users of the development to also
use the path in their experience of accessing and using the development.
4. The proposal will construct one or more mid-block bicycle or pedestrian accesses
provided the following are met (not all are required):
a. Construction features such as ramps, bollards, or curb cuts, when used,
physically limit use of the feature to bicycles or pedestrians.
b. The developer installs safety enhancements, such as bicycle stop signs,
lights, walkway areas, or other features, to minimize conflicts between
bicycles and pedestrians.
c. Mid-block crossings connect to and obviously comprise part of the pedestrian
or bicycle route to building parking lots or front door entrances.
d. Bollards and related safety barrier measures create or enhance an effect that a
mid-block crossing is safeguarded or sequestered from passing motor vehicle
traffic.
e. The overall building design has the effect of increasing or supporting
increases in transit ridership in the same way as buildings which comply with
Subsection (A), above.
5. The development amply uses wayfaring signs that:
a. Identify pedestrian and bicycle connections which are present upon, adjacent
to, and that exist nearby, the development. Such signage should encourage
use of such connections and be of similar size, attractiveness, or visibility as
any vehicle parking signs; and
b. Identify bicycle parking areas.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 8  Site Orientation and Design Standards
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC 8-5 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
6. Signage inside the buildings, along with other information or with internal layout,
alone or together alert and direct persons to transit stops or other transit amenities
such as mid-block crossings or informational kiosks.
7. The developer constructs offsite improvements, such as pedestrian facilities, or
traffic control devices, that increase connectivity of dedicated pedestrian paths or
demonstrates that constructed improvement will be compatible with and
encourage future connections.

Street Parking and Loading, off-street parking for attached dwellings on a single lot shall
include these design standards:
A. Parking lots may not be located between a multiple-family structure and the right-of-way
the structure fronts on.
B. If there is no parking lot or alley access to attached dwellings, and motor vehicle access is
from the street, parking must be either in an attached garage that is set back a minimum
of five (5) feet behind the front door of the residential structure, in a detached accessory
structure located at least fifty (50) feet from the front property line, or in a parking area at
the side or rear of the site, or shall comply with the following standards:
1. The garage door width of the dwelling is fifty percent (50%) or less of the width
of the street facing elevation, and does not extend beyond the front door; or
2. The garage door is behind or even with the front door and the dwelling has a
roofed front porch, which is at least 1/3 as wide as the front elevation and at least
five (5) feet deep. The porch may encroach within the required front yard setback
a maximum of five (5) feet without a variance provided the foundation for the
dwelling complies with the minimum front setback standard; and
3. The street facing wall of the dwelling contains at least one (1) window on the
ground floor that allows visibility of the street.
C. Side and rear yard setbacks for parking lots and/or garages shall be the same as the
minimum building setbacks of the underlying zoning district or the same as the minimum
building setback of any adjacent residential zoning district, whichever is more restrictive.
Side and rear yard setbacks based on building height shall not be applied to parking lots
or the access driveways.
8.230 Outdoor Private Space. Outdoor private space is required for each residential dwelling unit.
A. Each ground level dwelling unit shall have an attached accessible outdoor private space
of not less than sixty (60) square feet in area. Individual outdoor areas for ground level
units must be visually screened from each other by walls, fences, or vegetation screening
that is at least six (6) feet high and totally sight-obscuring.
B. Each upper level unit shall have an attached outdoor private space, such as a balcony, of

between Historic Columbia River Highway and 2nd Street extended west to its
intersection with 257th Avenue from 257th Avenue to the SE Sandy Street right-of-way.
8.240 Authority to Adjust Standards.
A. Because of the diverse topography, parcel configurations, and site characteristics within
the City, it is neither practical nor feasible to uniformly apply these design standards to

A. Any existing or proposed use subject to minimum off-street parking requirements and
located within four hundred feet (400) feet of an existing transit route may reduce the
number of required parking spaces by up to ten percent (10%) by providing a transit stop
and related amenities including a public plaza, pedestrian sitting areas, or additional
landscaping, provided such landscaping does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
total area dedicated for transit- oriented uses.
B. Required parking spaces may be reduced at a ratio of one (1) parking space for each one
hundred (100) square feet of transit amenity space provided above and beyond the
minimum required by this Code.
C. Required off-street parking spaces may be reduced by one (1) parking space for every onstreet
parallel parking space located adjacent to the subject site. For purposes of

uses computed separately with a reduction of up to twenty-five percent (25%) to account
for shared parking between adjacent businesses and services.
C. Required parking facilities of two (2) or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may be
satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that it can be shown by
the owners or operators that the need for the facilities does not materially overlap (e.g.,

As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-1 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
Chapter 14  Flood Management
14.005 Purpose. Without establishing any priority, the purpose of this Chapter is to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions or degradation of water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life, health, and property in areas subject to periodic flooding;
B. Implement the Floodplain requirements of Statewide Planning Goal 7 - which relates to
areas subject to natural disasters and hazards;
C. Through floodplain regulation, contribute to the properly functioning condition of
streams and rivers and address, in part, the water quality aspects of Statewide Planning
Goal 6;
D. Implement requirements for the City's participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program, and voluntary participation in the Community Rating System;
E. Implement the actions derived from the Multnomah County Natural Hazard Mitigation
Plan to minimize the risk of natural hazards, such as flooding, to people and property;
F Ensure continuity of City services, access to City facilities, and minimal prolonged
business interruptions during times of flood;
G. Manage stormwater drainage in a manner that:
1. Maintains the properly functioning conditions of waterways;
2. Provides for the conveyance and temporary storage of floodwater;
3. Reduces floodwater velocity;
4. Facilitates sediment deposition in the floodplain;
5. Provides an opportunity for groundwater recharge; and
6. Promotes other stormwater and floodplain functions.
These provisions are also intended to minimize maintenance costs, eliminate potential
hazards before they occur, and protect properties and persons adjacent to drainageways
and to other natural hazard areas;
H. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water purification and sewage
treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains;
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-2 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
I. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development;
J. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood
hazard;
K. Compel those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for
their actions;
L. Maintain and improve water quality;
M. Minimize erosion and loss of native vegetation;
N. Maintain wetlands, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas within the City,
because wetlands help to maintain water quality and flood storage capacities;
O. Avoid any increase in base flood elevations as a result of development;
P. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Q. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
R. Reduce flood losses and maintain water quality. In order to accomplish its purpose, this
Chapter includes methods and provisions to:
1. Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including buildings,
structures, and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare of
citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
2. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
3. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
flood damage or erosion;
4. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert
flood waters or that may increase flood hazards on other lands;
5. Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which carry and store flood waters, and;
6. Coordinate with and supplement provisions of Oregon Building Codes.
S. To advance these purposes, where not required, creation of open space tracts is
encouraged within areas designated as natural hazards on the Comprehensive Plan and
official zoning maps.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-3 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
14.010 Applicability.
A. These provisions shall apply to public and private properties in the one percent (1%)
annual chance of flood floodplain (100-year floodplain or Special Flood Hazard Area) as
mapped by the Federal Insurance Administrator of rivers and local streams within the
planning jurisdiction of the City of Troutdale, which includes land in unincorporated
Multnomah County within the Citys Urban Planning Area.
B. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator in a
scientific and engineering report entitled The Flood Insurance Study for Multnomah
County, Oregon and Incorporated Areas of Multnomah County, with accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this ordinance. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at the Community Development
Department located at 2200 SW 18th Way, Troutdale, OR 97060 (storage location subject
to change, consult the Floodplain Manager for current file storage location). Metro, a
regional metropolitan planning agency representing portions of Clackamas, Multnomah,
and Washington Counties, mapped the flood hazard areas from areas inundated by
flooding in 1996 on the Title 3 map. The Title 3 maps are adopted for reference only. Not
every Special Flood Hazard Area has been mapped by the Federal Insurance Agency
through the Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Maps cited above. The
Floodplain Manager or designee is authorized through Sections 14.020 to obtain from
applicants the information necessary to determine the presence and extent of unmapped
Special Flood Hazard Areas as part of reviewing development proposals that affect the
floodplain. Once approved by the Floodplain Administrator or designee, such information
shall be incorporated into the Natural Hazards Map and used by the City of Troutdale to
supplement the Flood Insurance Study, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and Digital Flood
Insurance Rate Maps cited above to ensure consistency with the floodplain regulations
contained in this Chapter. Contested base flood elevations are to be reviewed under the
provisions of Subsection 14.020.D of this Chapter. The City will keep a record of all
surveys, delineations, and any Letter of Map Change (LOMC) approved by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, as revisions to the local copy of the Title 3 map. The
City will submit this information to Metro for future updates of the Title 3 map.
C. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this
Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Code does not imply that
land or uses will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Code shall not create
liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance
Administrator, for any damages that result from reliance on this Code or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
14.015 Severability. The standards of this Chapter are subject to the severability standards as
described in Section 17.100 of this Code.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-4 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
14.020 Administration and Interpretation of Flood Insurance Rate Map Boundaries and Flood
Management Area Standards.
A. The Community Development Director shall designate a Floodplain Manager to be the
Local Administrator of this Chapter. The Floodplain Manager shall implement the
provisions and standards of the National Flood Insurance Program, the standards of this
Chapter, and make interpretations, where needed, including determinations regarding the
exact location of the boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Area (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) by
granting or denying Floodplain Development Permit applications in accordance with its
provisions. In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions shall be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;
3. Judged by established historical facts of flooding as known by, or made known to,
the governing body;
4. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes;
and
5. Defined in Section 1.040 of this Code.
B. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Manager. Duties of the Floodplain Manager
shall include, but not be limited to:

permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
3. Review all Floodplain Development Permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the
encroachment provisions of this Chapter are met.
4. When base flood elevation data has not been provided (A Zones) in accordance
with Section 14.010 of this Chapter, the Floodplain Manager shall obtain, review,
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from
a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Section 14.040 of this
Chapter.
5. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study,
FIRM, or required as in Section 14.020.C, obtain and record the actual elevation
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-5 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
(in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basements and
below-grade crawlspaces) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not the structure contains a basement.
6. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures where base flood
elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or as
required in Section 14.020.C, the Floodplain Manager shall:
a. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level), and
b. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
14.040 of this Chapter.
7. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this
ordinance.
8. Notify adjacent communities, the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and
Development, and other appropriate state and federal agencies, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification
to the Federal Insurance Administrator.
9. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
10. Notify FEMA within six (6) months of project completion when an applicant had
obtained a Conditional Letter of Map Change from FEMA, or when development
altered a watercourse, modified floodplain boundaries, or modified Base Flood
Elevations. This notification shall be provided as a Letter of Map Change. The
property owner shall be responsible for preparing technical data to support the
Letter of Map Change application and paying any processing or application fees
to FEMA. The Floodplain Manager shall be under no obligation to sign the
Community Acknowledgement Form, which is part of the Conditional Letter of
Map Change and Letter of Map Change application, until the applicant
demonstrates that the project will or has met the requirements of this Code and all
applicable State and Federal laws.
11. Report to FEMA on each development permit issued in the SFHA, including:
a. Amount of fill or structural displacement of flood storage, and the amount
(in volume and area) of compensatory storage provided;
b. Amount of new impervious surface and types and amounts of
compensatory mitigation provided;
c. The number of trees equal to or greater than six (6) inches in diameter at
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management

breast height removed, and the types and amounts of compensatory
mitigation provided;
d. The area in which clearing and/or grading occurred;
e. For any project that disconnects or reconnects land to the floodplain, the
type of project and amount of land disconnected or reconnected; and
f. Location of the project and of the corresponding mitigation.
14. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the
areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section 14.055 of this Chapter.
C. Use of Other Base Flood Data for Permit Review. When base flood elevation data is not
available through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or has not been provided in
accordance with Section 14.010 of this Chapter, the City may obtain, review, and utilize
any reasonable base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, in order to assure that proposed development will be reasonably safe from
flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical
data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to
elevate at least two (2) feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance
rates.
D. Contested Boundaries. A person contesting the location of the boundary has the
opportunity to submit a Letter of Map Change (LOMC) directly to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to change the Flood Insurance Rate Map mapping of
their property. If a land use application is submitted before a LOMC is approved by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the application will be processed under the
standards of this Chapter.
E. Inspections. The Floodplain Manager shall inspect development that is subject to the
permit requirements of this Chapter, including buildings and structures exempt from the
Building Code. The Floodplain Manager shall inspect Special Flood Hazard Areas to
determine if development is being undertaken without the issuance of a permit. Annual
inspection logs shall be maintained by the Floodplain Manager.

Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-11 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
14.035 Floodplain Development Permit
A. Background. To participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a
community must adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance that regulates
development in the floodplain. This floodplain management ordinance is housed
primarily in Chapter 14 of this Code, but is in part addressed in other Chapters of this
Code. One of the basic Federal requirements for regulating Development in the
Floodplain is a requirement for a Floodplain Development Permit (locally, a Floodplain
Development Permit) before construction or other development begins within any Special
Flood Hazard Area. In this context, the term "development" is defined in Section 1.040.
This chapter contains provisions for the federally required Floodplain Development
Permit and is consistent with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations.
A Floodplain Development Permit is required for development within the Flood
Management Area except as noted in Section 14.035.C of this Chapter.
B. Applicability. Unless exempt per Section 14.035.C, below, approval of a Floodplain
Development Permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within
any area of special flood hazard established in Section 14.010.B of this Chapter. The
permit shall be for all structures including manufactured dwellings, as set forth in the
Section 1.040 and for all development including fill and other activities, also as set forth
in the Section 1.040.
C. Exemptions. The following activities do not require a Floodplain Development Permit:
1. Removal of invasive, nuisance, or prohibited plant species that exposes the
ground, provided a revegetation plan approved or prepared by the City, state, a
federal agency, Metro, SOLV, the East Multnomah Soil & Water Conservation
District, or other similar organizations as determined by the Floodplain Manager,
is carried out to provide shade and habitat, prevent erosion of steep slopes and/or
sedimentation into the protected water feature. A copy of the plan shall be
provided to the Floodplain Manager prior to beginning the work.

Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-18 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
1. The applicant shall demonstrate that there is no reasonable nor practical
alternative design or method of development that would have a lesser impact on
the Flood Management Area than the one proposed.
2. If there is no reasonable nor practical alternative design or method of
development the project shall be designed in compliance with applicable parts of
Subsections (B) through (X) of this Section, so that the impacts on the Flood
Management Area are limited and the plans shall include restoration, replacement,
or rehabilitation of the vegetation within the Flood Management Area.
3. The applicant shall provide mitigation to ensure that impacts to the functions and
values of the vegetation corridor and integrity of the slope will be mitigated or
restored to the extent practicable.
B. A professional engineer registered in Oregon must certify that the development will not
result in any increase in flood levels throughout the SFHA during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge, and that water quality will not be adversely affected.
C. As applicable, the development must be authorized by the Oregon Department of State
Lands, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and
the Sandy Drainage Improvement Company. The applicant shall obtain and submit a
copy of all required state and federal permits for any proposed development in the Flood
Management Area, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
D. Unless otherwise authorized under the provisions of this Chapter, the development shall
comply with the underlying zoning district dimensional standards and the minimum
vegetation corridor as established in Sections 4.316 and 4.317 of this Code. The applicant
shall submit an exhibit that shows the location and provides a description of all actions to

of the flood plain area, provided the standards of this Code are met. Exception:
Public roads necessary to serve the transportation needs of the City may exceed
thirty percent (30%) of the Flood Management Area provided all other applicable
standards of this Chapter have been met.
2. Clustering of houses and multiple-family units, zero lot line developments, and/or
modifications to setbacks may be approved under the Type II procedure in order
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-19 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
to accommodate the density permitted within the underlying zoning district and
not exceed the impervious surface limitation of thirty percent (30%) of the Flood
Management Area on the site.
3. The Director, or their designee, may grant an administrative variance of up to fifty
percent (50%) of any dimensional standard in the underlying zoning district
where necessary to avoid development within the Flood Management Area.
G. Maintain flood storage capacity. The developer is required to offset new fill placed
in the floodplain by excavating an additional flood-able area to replace the lost
flood storage area, preferably at hydrologically equivalent sites. All development
proposals in the SFHA shall provide compensatory mitigation for impacts to flood
storage, water infiltration, and riparian vegetation to ensure that new development does
not increase flood hazards on other properties. A mitigation plan shall be submitted with
the land use application. All required actions derived from that plan shall be completed
prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a Certificate of Completion for a
subdivision, or the final building inspection, as applicable. Balanced cut and fill is
required for permitted development in the Flood Management Area. Excavation and fill
shall be performed in a manner to maintain or increase flood storage and conveyance
capacity and not increase design flood elevations. A professional engineer registered in
Oregon must certify that the development will not result in any increase in flood levels
throughout the SFHA during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
1. All fill placed at or below the design flood elevation in the Flood Management
Area shall be balanced with at least an equal volume or amount of soil material
removal. The development shall be designed to minimize development within the
Flood Management Area and amount of fill necessary. Balanced cut and fill may
be used to elevate structures but shall not be used for density transfer. Residential
density must be calculated prior to changes to the floodplain as a result of
balanced cut and fill.
2. Excavation shall not be counted as compensating for fill if such areas will be
filled with water in non-storm winter conditions.
3. The cumulative effect of any proposed development shall not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood. Onsite flood storage capacity shall not
decrease as a result of development, vegetation removal, or excavation.

must be submitted to, and reviewed by, the City prior to approval of
development, and the data shall be submitted with the Floodplain
Development Permit.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-20 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
b. The No-Rise certification and supporting technical data must stipulate
no impact on the 100-year flood elevations, floodway elevations, or
floodway widths at the new cross-sections and at all existing crosssections
anywhere in the model.
c. A sample No-Rise certification is available in the Community
Development Department.
5. All new buildings built on fill in the regulatory floodplain shall be constructed on
fill:
a. Certified by a professional engineer registered in Oregon as suitably
designed and compacted for the development (e.g. fill that meets the
criteria of 1803.5.8 and Section 1804.4 of the International Building Code,
Section 2.4 of ASCE 24, or their equivalent); and
b. Providing protection from erosion and scour.
6. When a project proposes development that will alter a watercourse, modify
floodplain boundaries, or modify Base Flood Elevations, the application shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Change from FEMA prior to grading and
filling the site and then obtain and submit the final Letter of Map Change prior to
final inspections, or issuance of a certificate of completion, or issuance of the
certificate of occupancy as required under this Section. When a project applicant
has demonstrated through the Floodplain Development Permit that, in addition to
the standards listed for Section 14.040.G, the following standards have been
achieved, a Conditional Letter of Map Change/Letter of Map Change may not be
required:
a. Fill is not proposed in the floodway for the site to be impacted through
development;
b. The project site is not being elevated to or above the base flood elevation
(BFE);
c. The project is proposing to remove unsuitable existing material (topsoil)
and backfilling with select structural material, not altering the existing
(natural grade) elevation of the site;
d. The site to be impacted does not have US Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) designations for critical habitat for Threatened or Endangered;
and
e. In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-21 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
fill) within A or AE Zones on the communitys FIRM, has demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood at any point within the
community.
7. All proposals that include engineering analysis for maintenance of flood storage
capacity are subject to review by a qualified engineer licensed in the State of
Oregon. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of this independent review
and will be advised at the time of application of this expectation.
H. Residential Development, including accessory structures as referenced in Section 5.010
of this Code and not constructed in accordance with Section 14.040.V. Note: if more than
fifty percent (50%) of the lot being developed is affected by the floodplain, then the
minimum density standard of this Code does not apply.
1. Elevate structures. The minimum finished floor elevation, including basement
floor, for all new or substantially improved residential structures in the Flood
Management Area shall be at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, as
established by Section 14.010.B in this Chapter, and as demonstrated through the
Elevation Certificate submittals as established in this Section. Elevation
Certificates shall be required for all residential development as required by the
Community Rating System.
a. An Elevation Certificate shall be submitted with the construction plans.
The Elevation Certificate shall include the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement). The Elevation Certificate shall be certified by a land
surveyor, engineer, or architect who is authorized by state or local law to
certify elevation information for construction within specific flood hazard
areas.
b. A second certified Elevation Certificate shall be submitted to the City of
Troutdale prior to pouring the foundation.
c. A third certified Elevation Certificate shall be submitted after the structure
is completed based upon finished construction.
d. The City shall maintain the Elevation Certificates for public inspection.
2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are
prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect, or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-22 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
grade.
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other devices
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
d. Where possible, openings will be installed on at least two opposing sides
of the enclosed area.
3. Below-grade crawlspaces are allowed only when in compliance with the design
requirements of FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01, Crawlspace Construction for
Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. Buildings that have belowgrade
crawlspaces will have higher flood insurance premiums than buildings that
have the preferred crawlspace construction with an interior elevation at or above
the lowest adjacent exterior grade.
a. The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed
through the required openings:
i. Openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and existence of floodwaters is required. The
bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one (1)
foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. See FEMA
Technical Bulletin 1-93, Opening in Foundation Walls, for
guidance.
ii. All portions of the building below the base flood elevation must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes
not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the
building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that
extend below the BFE. The recommended construction practice is
to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above BFE.
Ductwork or other utility systems located below the insulation may
pull away from their supports. See page 8 of Technical Bulleting 1-
93 and FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-93 Flood Resistant Materials
Requirements.
iii. Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be
elevated above the base flood elevation or designed so that
floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-23 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must
either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters. For
further guidance, see FEMA 348, Protecting Building Utilities
from Flood Damage.
b. The interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation must not
be more than two (2) feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade.
c. The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must
not exceed four (4) feet at any point. The height limitation is the maximum
allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses
and building Code requirements for flood hazard areas. Crawlspaces may
not be converted to basements.
d. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from
the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system
will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics,
such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through
porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes,
drainage tiles or gravel, or crushed stone drainage by gravity or
mechanical means.
e. Crawlspace construction is not permitted in areas with flood velocities
greater than five (5) feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a
qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional
engineer. For velocities in excess of five (5) feet per second, other
foundation types should be used.
f. The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation (BFE)
and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by
allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each
flood vent opening can be no more than one (1) foot above the lowest
immediate interior or exterior grade.
4. Substantial improvements will require elevation of any non-elevated structure to
two (2) feet above the base flood elevation in compliance with this Section and in
accordance with Section 1.040. Substantial improvement is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. Substantial improvements include:
a. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which exceeds forty-nine percent (49%) of the market value of the
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-24 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
structure as established by the County appraiser or a licensed professional
appraiser.
b. Reconstruction or repair of a structure that exceeds forty-nine percent
(49%) of the market value of the building before it was damaged.
c. Additions to an existing structure when the addition increases the market
value of the structure by more than forty-nine percent (49%) or the floor
area by more than twenty percent (20%).
5. Comply with other standards of this Section, as applicable.
I. Manufactured dwellings within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
1. All manufactured dwellings to be placed or substantially improved on sites
outside of or within a new, existing, or expansion to an existing manufactured
dwelling park or subdivision shall be elevated so that the bottom of the
longitudinal chassis frame beam is at or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
2. Anchoring shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-thetop
or frame ties to ground anchors (Reference FEMAs Manufactured Home
Installation in Flood Hazard Areas guidebook for additional techniques).
3. Manufactured dwellings shall have all electrical crossover connections installed at
a minimum of twelve (12) inches above BFE.
4. Manufactured dwellings supported on solid foundation walls shall be constructed

conditions of the base flood.
14.045 Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14.010.B of
this Chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential, the following provisions apply:
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-30 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
A. Except as provided in Section 14.045.C, encroachments, including fill, new construction,
development, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited unless
certification by a registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Section 14.040.A is satisfied, all new construction, development, and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
Section 14.040 of this Code.
C. Floodways and other high hazard zones are extremely hazardous areas due to
exceptionally high flood and erosion potential. In these areas, the development actions
permitted in high hazard zones shall be limited to water-dependent uses; bridges and
other location-dependent uses; habitat restoration activities consistent with Sections
14.035.C(2); low-intensity recreation; and bioengineered banks.
14.050 Before Regulatory Floodway. In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated,
no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the communitys FIRM, unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
14.055 Flood Management Area Variance Procedures. Variances from dimensional standards of the
underlying zoning district or other provisions of this Code not part of this Chapter shall be
processed in accordance with Section 6.800 of this Code.
A. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be
issued is for new construction, development, and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
considerations of Section 14.055.A(1 - 11) have been fully reviewed. As the lot size
increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-31 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject
to flooding or erosion damage;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the
flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
and,
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Statewide Inventory of Historic
Properties, without regard to the procedures set forth in this Section.
1. Is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the site,
building or structure;
2. Will not result in the site, building or structure losing its historic designation; and
3. Demonstrates consistency with all other local, state, or federal laws or ordinances,
including documentation of any necessary consultations with state or federal
agencies.
C. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. The Director, or their designee, may grant a Type II variance of up to fifty percent (50%)
of any dimensional standard in the underlying zoning district where necessary to avoid
construction or development within the Flood Management Area. The Director or
designee shall make a determination in accordance with the criteria established in Section
14.055.J of this Chapter.
Troutdale Development Code Chapter 14  Flood Management
As Established by Ord. 851 TDC 14-32 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
F. Applications for variances to dimensional standards in excess of that provided in Section
14.055.E shall be a Type III application.
G. The Planning Commission or Director, or their designee, may attach conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this Chapter.
H. As a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program, the City is not authorized to
grant a variance from the requirement to elevate or floodproof structures in accordance
with state and federal regulations, whichever is most restrictive. Variances may be issued
for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of
floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such
action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except
Section 14.055.A and otherwise complies with Sections 14.040.P - R of this Chapter.
I. The City cannot grant a variance from the special flood hazard designation assigned by
the Federal Insurance Administrator to a site. However, a property owner may request a
Letter of Map Change (LOMC) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
J. In reviewing a Type III Variance, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical
evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other Sections of this Chapter and
other Chapters of this Code, and make affirmative findings, with or without conditions,
for each of the following criteria:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause that the need for the variance is not of the
applicants making and will not result in a use of the site that is not otherwise
permitted in the underlying zoning district.
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant and is the minimum necessary to grant relief.
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section
14.055.A(1)  (11) or conflict with existing local, state, or federal regulations.
4. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles.
5. A determination that the development project cannot be located outside the
Special Flood Hazard Area and/or high hazard area and that impacts to flood
storage, water infiltration, and riparian vegetation have been minimized to the
extent practicable.
6. A demonstration of consistency with all other local, state, or federal laws or
ordinances, including documentation of any necessary consultations with state or
federal agencies.

with the provisions agreed upon under the acknowledgment.
2. Notify the permittee and the permittees surety of the permittees failure to perform
as required by this Code.
3. Demand payment from the permittee for the unfulfilled obligation.
4. If the security for the obligation is a bond, notify the surety that has furnished the
bond that reimbursement for the expense for fulfillment of the obligation is due and
payable to the City or, if the security is a deposit of cash or other assets, appropriate
as much of the deposit as is necessary to recoup the expense.
C. If a bond or other security required by Section 17.050, Bond or Cash Deposit, of this
Chapter is not sufficient to compensate the City for expenses necessary to fulfill the
obligation, the amount due to the City for the obligation is a lien in favor of the City and
upon the entire contiguous real property of the owner of the land subject to the obligation.
D. The lien attaches upon the filing with the City Recorder of notice of the claim for the
amount due for the fulfillment of the obligation. The notice shall demand the amount due,
allege the insufficiency of the bond or other security to compensate the City fully for the
expense of the fulfillment of the obligation, and allege the permittees failure to do the
required obligation.
E. The lien may be foreclosed in the manner prescribed by law for foreclosing other liens on
real property.
17.070 Adjusting Bond or Deposit for Future Obligation.
A. In the case of an obligation to perform at a future date, such as a surface mining
reclamation obligation, the amount of bond or deposit shall be adjusted annually to reflect
changing estimates of the costs of fulfilling the obligation.
B. Where the City carries out the obligation because the permittee has failed to do so under
Section 17.060, Noncompliance with Provisions under Obligation, of this Chapter, the
City may expend funds only to the extent necessary to complete the obligation. If the
amount specified in the notice to the surety is not paid within thirty (30) days after that
notice is given the surety, the City shall institute proceedings to recover the amount.

Troutdale Development Code Appendix A  Design Standards for Central Business District
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC Appendix A-1 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
Appendix A  Design Standards for Central Business District
A.101 Purpose.
A. The purpose of these design standards is to guide the design of buildings constructed in the
CBD zoning district to ensure that, through appropriate use of facades, windows, building
orientation, and architectural details, new structures and alterations of existing structures
are physically and visually compatible with other buildings within the downtown business
district. Existing buildings in the downtown area reflect architectural styles that were
popular during the early to mid-twentieth century. It is the desire of the City to have
buildings conform to architectural styles of this era. The design standards are intended to
further define those characteristics that cause buildings to look like they were constructed
during this period.
B. These standards are intended to encourage good quality design in new building
construction, enhance street safety, and provide a comfortable street environment by
providing features of interest to pedestrians. Good design results in buildings that are in
visual harmony with nearby buildings, leading to a central downtown district that is
attractive, interesting, active, and safe. These qualities, in turn, contribute to the creation
of a downtown core which facilitates easy pedestrian movement and establishment of a
rich mixture of uses.
A.102 Dimensional Standards.
A. Lot Area, Lot Width, and Lot Depth: As specified in the CBD zoning district.
B. Setbacks: As specified in the CBD zoning district.
C. Landscaping: Minimum five percent of site area, except that no minimum landscaping is
required for the area between Historic Columbia River Highway and 2nd Street extended
west to its intersection with 257th Avenue from 257th Avenue to the SE Sandy Street
right-of-way.
D. Building Height: The maximum height of a structure fronting on Historic Columbia River
Highway shall be measured above the grade of Historic Columbia River Highway as it
occurs adjacent to the lot.
A.103 Pedestrian Accessibility.
A. Buildings shall maintain and enhance the pedestrian scale and orientation of the downtown
core.
B. Building entries must comply with the accessibility requirements of the Oregon State
Structural Specialty Code.
Troutdale Development Code Appendix A  Design Standards for Central Business District
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC Appendix A-2 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
C. Special attention shall be given to designing a primary building entrance which is both
attractive and functional.
D. Buildings located at the intersection of two (2) streets shall consider the use of a corner
entrance to the building.
E. Pedestrian environment may be enhanced by street furniture, landscaping, awnings, and
movable planters of seasonal flowers.
A.104 Compatibility with Existing Downtown Businesses. The size and shape of proposed construction
shall be comparable with the size and shape of nearby traditional storefront buildings. Where
building sizes will not be equivalent or comparable, larger building facades shall be broken down
into units that resemble the size of existing storefront facades. Likewise, the form of new
construction shall complement the general shape of existing, nearby storefront buildings and
their features.
A.105 Building Materials and Colors.
A. Facades shall be varied and articulated to provide visual interest to pedestrians. Within
larger projects, variations in facades, floor levels, architectural features, and exterior
finishes shall create the appearance of several smaller buildings.
B. Exterior building materials shall convey an impression of durability. Materials such as
masonry, stone, stucco, and wood are encouraged. Metal is not allowed as the primary
exterior building material, but it may be used for accents including awnings.
C. Where masonry is used for exterior finish, decorative patterns must be incorporated.
Examples of these decorative patterns include multicolored masonry units such as brick,
stone, or cast stone, in layered or geometric patterns, or split-faced concrete block to
simulate a rusticated stone-type construction.
D. Wood siding must be bevel, shingle siding, or channel siding and must not be applied in a
diagonal or herringbone pattern. T1-11 style siding is not permitted.
E. Preferred colors for exterior building finishes are earth tones, creams, and pastels of earth
tones. High-intensity primary colors, metallic colors, and black may be utilized as trim and
detail colors but shall not be used as primary wall colors.
A.106 Roof Materials, Parapets, and Roof Pitch.
A. Pitched roof structures shall have a minimum roof pitch of 6:12.
B. Flat roofs are permitted with detailed stepped parapets or detailed brick coursing.
C. Parapet corners must be stepped or the parapet must be designed to emphasize the center
or primary entrance(s), unless the primary entrance is at the corner of the building.
Troutdale Development Code Appendix A  Design Standards for Central Business District
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC Appendix A-3 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
D. Visible sloped roofs must be a non-color: gray, black, or dark brown.

A. Buildings must have an entrance connecting directly between Historic Columbia River
Highway and the building interior. The entrance must be open to the public during all
business hours.
B. Building entrances must be architecturally emphasized and visible from the street.
C. Due to the elevation difference between the Historic Columbia River Highway and the
public parking lot, daylight basement type of construction is preferred. This method of
construction has the benefit of causing all materials stored below Historic Columbia River
Highway to be screened and secured behind sight-obscuring walls, adding to the
attractiveness of the downtown area.
A.108 Building Facades.
A. Ornamental devices, such as molding, entablature, and friezes, are encouraged at the
roofline. Where such ornamentation is present in the form of a linear molding or board, the
band must be at least eight (8) inches wide.
B. Alcoves, Porches, Arcades, etc. Buildings must incorporate features such as arcades, roofs,
porches, alcoves, porticoes, and awnings to protect pedestrians from the rain and sun.
Awnings and entrances may be designed to be shared between two structures.
C. Traditional Storefront Elements. For buildings designed to house retail, service, or office
businesses, traditional storefront elements are required. These elements include:
1. Front and side building walls placed within ten (10) feet of abutting street right-ofway
boundaries.
2. Clearly delineated upper and lower facades.
3. A lower facade dominated by large display windows and a recessed entry or entries.
4. Smaller, regularly spaced windows in the upper floor.

percent (20%) of the ground floor wall area in display areas, windows, or doorways.
Blank walls are prohibited.
6. Ground floor windows are also required on facades facing any public parking lot. The
minimum requirement is sixteen (16) square feet per story or six percent (6%) of the
facade, whichever is greater.
C. Upper Floor Window Standards.
1. Glass area dimensions shall not exceed 5'x7'. (The longest dimension may be taken
either horizontally or vertically.)
2. Windows must have trim or molding at least two (2) inches wide around their

Troutdale Development Code Appendix A  Design Standards for Central Business District
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC Appendix A-5 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
3. At least half of all the window area in upper floors must be made up of glass panes
with dimensions no greater than 2'x3'. Windows that have 1'x1' grid inside doublepane
glass are appropriate and are encouraged.
A.110 Landscaping/Streetscape.
A. Benches, outdoor seating, and trash receptacles must complement the existing ornamental
street lighting and be in keeping with the overall architectural character of the downtown.

Troutdale Development Code Appendix B  Supplemental Standards along 257th Avenue
As Amended by Ord. 851 TDC Appendix B-1 Effective Date: 17-Jan-19
Appendix B  Supplemental Standards along 257th Avenue
B.101 Purpose. The purpose of these development standards is to enhance the streetscape associated
with 257th Avenue. Currently, 257th Avenue creates a tunnel-like effect as a result of sound
walls and fences adjacent to the sidewalk. The location of the sidewalk immediately next to the
street puts pedestrians in close proximity to high-volume, high-speed traffic without any
landscape buffer. These development standards are intended to promote more pedestrianfriendly
site designs by providing a more comfortable street environment for pedestrians.
B.102 Applicability. These development standards apply to new development of properties abutting
257th Avenue between Stark Street and Sturges Drive/Cherry Park Road (North) which meet
any of the following criteria:
A. Any vacant property.
B. Redevelopment of any commercial or apartment site that expands the building footprint of
an existing structure.
C. Any underdeveloped site that undergoes development to a more intensive use (i.e., singlefamily
dwelling to duplex).
B.103 Standards. In addition to any other standard of this title applicable to the development, the
following standards shall also apply:
A. The sidewalk on 257th Avenue shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet wide.
B. A minimum area of five (5) feet in width adjacent to the sidewalk must be landscaped.
C. Fences along 257th Avenue must be set back a minimum of five (5) feet from the back of
the sidewalk.
D. Within the required building setback area along 257th Avenue, the maximum height of a
fence or berm, or the combined height of both when a fence is placed upon a berm, shall
be forty-two (42) inches.
E. Sight-obscuring hedges or landscaping shall not exceed a height of forty-two (42) inches
from ground level. Trees separated by at least fifteen (15) feet are not subject to a height
limitation.
F. Street trees shall be planted in sidewalk tree wells meeting City specifications and spaced
every forty (40) feet. The developer of the property shall be responsible for planting tree
varieties approved by the City, or in lieu of the developer planting the street trees, the
developer of the property may pay an assessment to the City to provide for street tree
planting.
