§1-104. Headings.
Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph, Subparagraph,
Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be deemed to
govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the Code. The headings
of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are intended as mere captions
to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection or other division and shall not be
§1-104 Borough of Swissvale §1-106
1-6
deemed to be taken as titles of such Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any
part of said Section, Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-105. Tenses, Gender and Number.
Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present tense
includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the masculine gender
includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the masculine and neuter, and
the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and the singular includes the plural,
and the plural the singular.
(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-106. Construction.
1. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of this Code,
the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1501 et seq., shall be applied in
construing this Code.
2. Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
A. The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of
any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any offense
committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding commenced
before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
B. When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance, clause
or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive
such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision, unless it shall be
expressly so provided.
3. Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same as
those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption of this
Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions and regulations
and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall not affect any suit or
prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any of the prior ordinances or
regulations. Except as specifically stated in this Code or in the ordinance adopting this
consolidation, codification and revision of the ordinances and regulations of the
Borough of Swissvale, it is the intention of the Borough Council that no ordinance or
regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed by implication.
4. Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain resolutions,
that is, actions of the Borough Council of the Borough of Swissvale (in written
form and designated “resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Second Class Borough Code, 53 P.S. §65101 et
seq., at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such “resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend by their
inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending, revising or repealing
such resolution or resolutions as may have been included herein in the future. It is the
intention of the Borough Council that such actions of the Borough Council that may be
included in this Code and specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not
become an ordinance (requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or
§1-106 Administration and Government §1-108
1-7
repeal) by the simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-107. Normal Numbering.
1. Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
2. Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
3. Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into Subchapters
1A and 1B.
4. Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a Part
such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a hyphen,
followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the Part. For
example, “§1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly, “§27-305"
designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
5. Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are necessary,
Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into Paragraphs, Paragraphs
into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and Clauses into Subclauses, and
Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:

(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-108. Special Numbering Problems.
1. Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary to
introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or Sections,
the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition of a capital letter
suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number. Thus, a Chapter introduced
between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and Sections in that Chapter would be
numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it becomes necessary to introduce a Part between
existing Parts 5 and 6 the new Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would
be numbered, for instance, “§5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing
Sections 5 and 6 would be “§5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have
been introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
2. If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections, for
instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered Subsection .5-
A.
3. If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection between
§1-108 Borough of Swissvale §1-110
1-8
existing unites, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
4. Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or repeal,
the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old numbers until the
overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the vacated number may be
marked: “[Reserved].”
(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-109. Amending Code.
1. All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which amend,
repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance with the
numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed
Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part or provision hereof, by
subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by
omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as
numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence
of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances
omitted are readopted as a new Code by the Borough Council.
2. Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific reference
to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code in the following
language:
A. Amendment or Revision. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection
, is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . . .” The amended or revised
provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
B. Addition. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection , is
hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .” The new provision shall
then be set out in full as desired.
C. Repeal. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection , is hereby
repealed in its entirety.”
3. It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of this
Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any ordinance or
other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering system of this
Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such enactment be renumbered
in the process of supplementing, revising or updating this Code to conform to the
numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council hereby acknowledges and
confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease of reference and that the
renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code shall not in any manner affect
the validity of said enactment.
(Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§1-110. Altering Code.
It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or deletion any
part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter
or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution
or other official act of the Borough Council.

installed in existing multi-family dwellings of ten units or more, the detectors shall be
installed in accordance with the multi-family building power source requirements of
State law and any requirements of other ordinances covering installation of smoke
detectors in existing dwellings. Where smoke detectors are installed in existing
dwelling units not governed by other ordinances, the smoke detectors should be wired
directly to the power supply, where possible. Detectors installed in these buildings
however, may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated in a plug-in outlet
§7-204 Borough of Swissvale §7-209

seller, lesser or sublesser, to certify, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all
smoke detectors required by this Section, or any other applicable law or ordinance,
have been installed and are in proper working condition.
(Ord. 86-7, 7/9/1986, §6)
§7-207. Other Standards.

provisions of the National Fire Protection Association Standards, 72-E and 74 Editions,
and existing ordinances governing installation of smoke detectors. Where there is any
conflict between this Part and the existing standards, this Part and any rules and
regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall prevail.

major planned development, such as residential planned unit development or a planned
industrial park when adequate standards or requirements for grading the parcel are
approved by the Administrator.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §3)
§9-104. Exceptions.
A grading permit will not be required for any of the following situations:
A. Grading is limited to mining, quarrying or stockpiling of coal, rock, sand,
aggregate or clay that satisfies requirements of regulations of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
B. Grading is limited to solid waste disposal areas or sanitary landfills
operated in accordance with the requirements, rules and ordinances adopted by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Allegheny County
Department of Health. [Ord. 05-02]
C. Excavation does not exceed 5 feet in vertical depth, does not result in cut
and/or fill slope steeper than 4 horizontal to 1 vertical and does not exceed an area
of 1,000 square feet for areas recognized by the soil survey or better source as
containing landslide-prone soils. Better sources recognizing landslide-prone soil
areas may be the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey, a

from the top of such fill to the natural ground surface, the area of fill does not
exceed 5,000 square feet and the slope of fill is not steeper than 3 horizontal to 1
vertical.
G. Grading does not exceed new construction authorized by a building permit
properly issued by the governing body. Grading under the authorization of a
building permit should follow the standards and requirements of this Part.
H. Soil excavated under the authorization of a building permit properly
issued by the Borough Council is temporarily stockpiled on the same site as
excavation, provided, however, that if the material from such excavation is
thereafter to be sued for fill purposes for which a grading permit is required, such
permit must be obtained prior to such use in accordance with the requirements of
this Part. In addition, if excavated material is stockpiled on a site for a period of
longer than 120 days, than a permit shall be necessary when disposing of the fill
material.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §4; as amended by Ord. 05-02, 6/1/2005)
§9-105. Hazardous Conditions.
1. Whenever the Borough Council, upon the recommendation of its Administrator,
determines that any existing excavation, embankment or fill has become a hazard
as defined in §9-102, the owner of the property upon which the excavation, embankment,
or fill is located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt
of notice in writing from the Administrator shall within the reasonable period specified
therein repair, reconstruct or remove such excavation, embankment, or fill so as to
eliminate the hazard.
2. If, after such notification, the property owner has not made the necessary
repairs within the time adopted, then the governing body may direct government
employees to make the required repairs and the cost thereof shall be borne by the
property owner by a lien filed as provided by law.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §5)
§9-106. Application; Duties of Administrator.
1. Every applicant for a grading permit shall file a written application therefor
with the Administrator in a form prescribed by the Administrator. Such application
shall:
A. Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot, block,
tract or street address, or similar description which will readily identify and
definitely locate the proposed work.
B. Be accompanied by plans and specifications prepared signed and sealed
§9-106 Borough of Swissvale §9-106
9-6
by a professional engineer, surveyor or architect giving a reasonable picture of the
late and proposed soil erosion controls, if any. The Administrator may waive the
preparation or approval and signature by the professional engineer, surveyor or
architect only when it is self-evident that the proposed work is simple, clearly
shown on the plans submitted, sand creates no potential nuisance to adjacent
property or hazard, and does not include the construction of a fill upon which a
structure may be erected. Such plans may include a description of the site
proposed for grading; accurate location by lot, block, tract, street address,
longitude and latitude, co-ordinates, a location map or other similar information;
a contour map showing the present contours of the land and the proposed contours
of the land after completion of the proposed grading, and a plan showing cross
section of the proposed cut or fill which show the method of benching both cut
and/or fill. In addition, a plot plan may show the location of the grading,
boundaries, lot lines, neighboring streets or way, buildings, surface and subsurface
utilities and waterways. In addition, plans may include a description of the type
and classification of the soil from the soil survey or better; details and location of
any proposed drainage structures and pipes, walls, and cribbing; seeding locations
and schedules, debris basins, diversion channels; nature of fill material and such
other information as the Administrator may need to carry out the purposed of this
Part. All plans shall be dated and bear:
(1) The name and seal of the Professional Engineer who prepared the
same.
(2) The name of the applicant.
(3) The owner of the land. Plans shall be submitted in triplicate, one set
of which shall be of reproducible nature.
C. State the estimated dates for the starting and completion of grading work.
D. State the purpose for which the grading application is filed.
2. The duty of the Administrator shall be to obtain information and reports from
governmental agencies, and scientific and/or engineering journals, if available, and
professional engineers and/or engineering geologists, if necessary. This information and
these reports must be of sufficient detail to insure that proposed grading will n not
create a hazard and that there will be a minimum of soil erosion on the site to be
graded.
3. To be adequate, a geological report may include a detailed description of the
geological conditions of the site may; include conclusions and recommendations that
will demonstrate the relationship of the geological conditions to the proposed
development, including hazardous conditions, water resources, mineral resources and
environmental impact. A soil conservation report may include existing site description
as to topography, drainage, cover and soils; major resource problems as to soil
limitations, erosion and sediment potential and surface runoff changes; and
recommendations to minimize soil limitations, erosion and sediment, and surface water
disposal problems.
4. In no case shall the Administrator require more than minimum adequate
standards, as recommended by governmental agencies, professional engineers or
engineering geologists, and other requirements specified in this Part, for issuing a
§9-106 Grading and Excavating §9-109
9-7
grading permit.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §6)
§9-107. Completion and Performance Guarantee.
Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant shall post a bond, corporate
surety, or other approved security in the amount of 10% of the estimated cost of the
grading work and erosion control facilities proposed for the permit to guarantee of said
work and facilities in a satisfactory manner and meeting the requirements of this Part.
No bond shall be required if another bond or other approved security is posted for
construction and/or site improvements. When all requirements of this permit have been
met and the work has been completed in a satisfactory manner, the full amount of
security shall be returned to the person posting said security.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §7)
§9-108. Expiration of Permit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the
work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within 1 year or is not
completed within 3 years from the date of issue, provided that the governing body,
acting upon the recommendation of the Administrator, may, if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being
started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of
time, and, provided further, that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit. Any physical changes in the site such as
surface water drainage, soil and bedrock dislocations, alteration of groundwater
discharge or any other natural or man-made modification which would cause a doubt
to be cast upon the feasibility of the contents of the original permit approval, must be
reported to the Administrator in the intervening period between approval of permit and
completion of the project.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §8)
§9-109. Denial of Permit; Appeal.
When the requirements of this Part for obtaining a permit have been met, the
Administrator shall approve the proposed plan and grant a grading permit to the
applicant. Approved work may then start. However, when in the opinion of the
Administrator, work proposed by the applicant is likely to endanger any property, or
person, or any street or alley, or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall
be denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger property of
streets or alleys, or create hazardous conditions, the Administrator shall give due
consideration to: possible saturation by rains, earth movements, run-off surface waters
and sub-surface conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, aquifers,
springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
The Borough Council shall consider within 15 days appeals from the provisions of
these regulations or from the denial by the Administrator, and the Borough Council
within 15 days shall consider alternate methods, standards or materials proposed by
the developer when in his opinion strict compliance with the provisions of these
regulations is unnecessary. Any applicant or permit holder shall have the right to
§9-109 Borough of Swissvale §9-111
9-8
appeal to any Court of competent jurisdiction from any decision of the Borough Council.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §9)
§9-110. Grading Inspection and Supervision.
1. The permittee or his agent shall notify the Administrator in writing of the
start and completion of each continuous grading operation. Notice shall be received by
the Administrate or at his office at least 2 working days before start or completion of
grading operations.
2. Grading work at these stages or at any other time will be subject to spot
inspections at the discretion of the Administrator to determine that the work is being
performed in compliance with these regulations.
3. In special cases, when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil as
recognized by the soil survey or better, the Administrator may require special
precautions from the grader. The results of all soil tests and core borings made relating
to the site graded shall be submitted to the Administrator.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §10)
§9-111. Standards for Excavation.
1. Maximum slope steepness of a cut should be 3 horizontal to 1 vertical for
minimizing erosion and landslide hazard. However, a governmental review agency,
professional engineer or engineering geologist may recognize the types of soil on the
site to be graded from the soil survey or better. Maximum slopes can then be
determined as follows:
A. Landslide-prone soils where slopes greater than 25% shall have cut slopes
no steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical. Soil Survey map symbols are:
34-DE-6 34-E-2 34-F-1 65-E-2
B. Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall have cut slopes
no steeper than 2 horizontal to 1 vertical. Soil survey map symbols are:
32-B-2 34-C-2 65-C-2 67-C-2
32-C-2 34-D-2 65-D-2 67-D-2
34-B-2 65-B-2 67-B-1
C. Soils which are net e have a low probability of being landslide-prone shall
have a slope no steeper than 1½ horizontal to 1 vertical. All soil survey map
symbols except the symbols listed above donate soils of low landslide probability.
2. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed under
a grading permit, provided one or both of the following are satisfied:
A. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to
sustain a lope steeper than the slope specified above for recognized soil conditions
en the site. A written statement, signed and sealed by a professional engineer,
stating that the steeper slope will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating
a hazard will be slight, must be submitted to the Administrator.
§9-111 Grading and Excavating §9-114
9-9
B. A retaining wall or ether approved support, designed by a professional
engineer and approved by the Administrator is provided to support the face of
excavation.
3. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall generally be set back from adjacent
property lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the
edge without encroaching on the abutting property or street.
4. Guidelines for cuts in the “Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania” should be followed. One or a combination of
guidelines should be used to minimize hazard, depending en site conditions and
proposed grading.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §11)
§9-112. Standards for Fills.
1. No fill should be placed ever trees, stumps or other material which could create
a hazard. Instead, such materials may be buried in natural ground where no structures
will be built or hazard created. Limbs can be chipped and mixed with the topsoil.
2. All fills should be compacted to provide stability of fill material and to prevent
undesirable settlement or slippage.
3. Clean soil or earth should be placed ever the top and exposed surfaces of the
fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all material used in the fill ether than clean soil or
earth. If the filling operation is intermittent, the top and exposed surfaces of the fill
should be so covered at the completion of each lift.
4. The top or bottom edge of slopes should generally be set back from adjacent
property lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the
edge without encroaching on the abutting property or street.
5. “Guidelines for fills in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania” should be followed. One or a combination of
guidelines should be used to minimize hazard, depending on site conditions and
proposed grading.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §12)
§9-113. Standards for Minimizing Erosion and Sediment.
Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the “Erosion and Sediment
Control Handbook for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,” should be followed. One or a
combination of guidelines should be used to minimize hazard, depending on site
conditions and proposed grading. However, the Administrator may approve grading
plans not meeting guidelines of the handbook if proposed grading will not constitute
a hazard. Governmental and/or engineering reports should be used as evidence that
proposed grading will not constitute a hazard.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §13)
§9-114. Retaining Walls.
1. Definition of Retaining Wall. A structure composed of concrete, steel or other
approved building material constructed for the purpose of supporting a cut or filled
§9-114 Borough of Swissvale §9-116
9-10
embankment which would otherwise not comply with the requirements of the
standards set forth in this Part, and which is more than 4 feet in height as measured
on the exposed vertical surface of the wall.
2. If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this Part a
building permit, as provided for by other municipal regulations shall not be required.
The grading permit will apply to the retaining wall, and the requirements for
inspection, etc. as stated herein will be complied with.
3. Retaining walls must be constructed in accordance with sound engineering
practice. The plans submitted for approval shall bear the seal of a professional
engineer.
4. The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of subterranean drainage
facilities shall be done strictly in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the
appropriate municipal specifications.
5. In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face of the
wall shall be 3 feet 0 inches back from the adjoining property.
A. A special exception to this requirement may be applied for and granted by
the Administrator if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that such a variance is
necessary to insure normal use of the property, i.e., for a sideline driveway.
B. The requirement of this paragraph may also be set aside when the
proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent property owners, and
appropriate documents so stating are filed with the application for the permit.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §14)
§9-115. Drainage Provisions.
1. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface or subsurface waters
from damaging:
A. The cut face of an excavation.
B. The sloping surface of a fill.
C. Adjacent property affected by the change in the existing natural runoff
pattern.
2. To prevent damage, grading plans should follow “Vegetative Control Methods”
and “Ditch and Conduit Control Methods” in the “Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania” when they fit the site. The Administrator
may approve methods and materials recommended by governmental agencies and
professional engineers when they are more suitable to the site in preventing damage.
Drainage facilities shall be designed to accommodate the largest size storm that would
occur on the average of every 2 years.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §15)
§9-116. Maintenance.
1. The owner of any property on which an excavation or fill has been made shall
maintain in good condition and repair the excavation or fill permitted, and also all

protective devices as may be a part of the permit requirements.
§9-116 Grading and Excavating §9-119
9-11
2. If, at any time subsequent to the completion of the grading work, the cut face
or fill slope shall evidence signs of deterioration, erosion, or other evidence which might
be detrimental to the properties above and below the grading site, the Planning
Commission/Council, upon the recommendation of its Administrator, may direct the
property owner to take necessary remedial steps in accordance with sound engineering
practice to restore the grading to a safe condition, and to do so in a reasonable period
of time.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §16)
§9-117. Liability.
Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this Part, nor the
compliance with the provisions hereto or with any condition imposed by the building
official hereunder, shall relieve any person from any responsibility for damage to
persons or property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose
any liability upon the County for damages to persons or property.
(Ord. 75-7, 12/10/1975, §17)
§9-118. Violation and Penalties.
No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair or maintain any grading,
excavation or fill, or cause the same to be done contrary to or in violation of any
provision of this Part.
When written notice of any of the provisions of this Part has been serviced by the
Administrator on any person, such violation shall be discontinued immediately or
within a reasonable time limit specified in such notice. If violation is not discontinued,
or extends beyond the specified time limit, the Administrator shall revoke the grading
permit and the violation is subject to fine.
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this Part, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to
exceed 30 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues shall constitute a
separate offense. Whenever such person shall have been notified by the Administrator
by service of summons in a prosecution or in any other way that he is committing such
violation of this Part, each day that he shall continue such violation after such
notification, shall constitute a separate offense punishable by a like fine or penalty.
Such fines or penalties shall be collected as like fines or penalties are now by law
collected. [Ord. 05-02]

§15-409. Residential Permit Parking.
1. Findings and Purpose. The Borough finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which
to park their own vehicles.
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of commuter
traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level.
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected areas
should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking preference
during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the Borough
considers it to be in the interest of the people of the Borough to provide for the
establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure primary access
to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner
ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in this
subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
Commuter Vehicle - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
Proprietor - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address. For the purpose
of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address.
Resident - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
Residential Area - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection .4 of this Section are
those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis of the
following criteria:

(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking
and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection with it.

program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are designated
as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded By and Including

made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who shall be only the
owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a proprietor of property
immediately adjacent to a street or other location within a residential parking permit
area. A separate application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each
application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, in an amount as established by
resolution of the Borough, which shall be for the use of the Borough, to be applied to
the cost of administering the residential permit parking program. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case
may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the case
may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver
number as taken from the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of the
§15-409 Motor Vehicles and Traffic §15-409
15-27
Chief of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the time of making application, to
present his driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee, and
determination by him that the information upon the application shows that the
applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police shall issue to
the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid for the remainder of
the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and registration numbers of the
motor vehicles, the residential parking area number and the expiration date. The
permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon making
application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a
violation of this Section for any person to display other than the current and valid
permit while standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at any time
when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee in an amount as established by

A. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the holder
of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a motor vehicle
operated by him in any designated residential parking area during those times
when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which
a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be
displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. A
residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder a parking
space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or
park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping, standing
or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other specified types of
vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic
or parking regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated;
any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder shall constitute
a violation of this Section by the permit holder and by the person who so used or
displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish false
information in an application to the Chief of Police in order to obtain a residential
parking permit.
9. Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority to revoke the
residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in violation of any provision
of this Section. Upon written notification to the present holder of the revocation, the
permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when
§15-409 Borough of Swissvale §15-411
15-28

Whenever a public sanitary sewer has been or shall be constructed on any street
or alley, each separate building used or intended to be used as a dwelling, office
building, storeroom, public hall, church, schoolhouse, and every tenement, fronting
upon such street or alley, and not previously connected with a public sewer, shall be
connected with said public sanitary sewer by a separate private sewer, within 30 days
after written or printed notice given to the owner of such building by the Street
Commissioner and upon the failure of any such owner to make such connection within
the said 30 days the same shall be made by the Borough and the cost thereof, together
with a penalty of 20% addition shall be collected from owner, provided however, that
more than one separate building may be connected with the public sewer by a single

§18-102. Construction.
The construction of every such private sewer shall be under the supervision and

Part.
(Ord. 813, 6/10/1924, §3)
§18-104. Permit to Connect.
No private sewer, to be connected with a public sewer, shall be laid unless the

from time to time by resolution of Borough Council, for such permit, and shall leave
with the Secretary a deposit in an amount as established from time to time by
§18-104 Borough of Swissvale §18-106

of constructing a branch sewer from the public sewer to the curb line. Said branch
sewer from the public sewer to the curb line shall be constructed by the Borough and
the cost of the material and labor employed in the construction of said branch sewer
shall be paid to the Borough by the owner of building. When such branch sewer has
been completed the Street Commissioner shall certify to the Borough Clerk the actual
cost of the material and labor in constructing branch sewer. Whereupon if said amount,
so certified, is less than the amount on deposit herein above required the Secretary of
Council shall remit the difference thereof to the owner making such deposit, and should
said amount be greater than the deposit, the excess cost shall be paid by the owner of
the building to be connected, within 10 days from the completion of branch sewer.

at points where branch sewers have already been constructed by the Borough, from the
main sewer to the curb line, the Street Commissioner shall certify to the Borough
Secretary the actual cost of the construction of said sewer, which amount, together with
the permit fee, above referred to, shall be paid by the owner before any permit shall be
issued for the connection of any private sewer therewith.

made of the private sewer.
(Ord. 813, 6/10/1924, §5)

businesses within a common structure may be metered individually. In all cases, the
party listed as being responsible for payment in the records of the authority shall also
be the responsible party for purposes of payment of the sewer usage fee and any and
all related penalties all.
2. In cases where residences or other establishments have private springs or
private wells, these establishments will be required to provide a meter on the spring
or well. This meter and its installation must be furnished by the property owner, must
be acceptable to the Borough, and shall be available to Borough employees for meter
readings at any time. In the case of a failure to install a meter, the sewer user fee shall
determined by employing the equivalent dwelling unit ("EDU") method of calculation

of this Chapter.

zoning requirements, topography of the land being developed, and provisions for
safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
B. Unless the topography of the land being developed or the existing pattern
of development in the immediately adjacent area shall be otherwise than herein
required, the following minimum standards for the design and size of blocks shall
prevail:
(1) Blocks shall not exceed 1,500 feet in length nor be less than 500 feet
in length.
(2) Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to accommodate
two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering an arterial
or collector street are used, or where due to the contour of the land or the
necessary layout of the development, there is insufficient depth between
intersecting streets for such two-tier design.
(3) Crosswalks or interior pedestrian walks shall be required in blocks
exceeding 1,000 feet in length to provide for pedestrian circulation or access
to community facilities. Such walks shall be paved for width of not less than
4 feet, shall be located in easements not less than 10 feet in width, and shall,
insofar as possible, be located in the center of any such block.
(4) Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use requires
other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for employees and customers
shall be provided along with safe and convenient limited access to the street

through and nonresidential traffic. Streets serving predominately commercial and
industrial areas shall be designed with consideration for anticipated truck traffic,
location of railroad facilities and safety of pedestrian movements.
F. Where development is proposed on an existing or proposed arterial street
or limited access highway, Council may require that provisions be made for
marginal access streets. Council may also require near service areas, double
frontage lots or such other treatment as will provide protection for abutting
properties, reduction in the number of intersections with primary streets, and
separation of local and through traffic.
G. Half or partial streets shall not be approved except where essential to
allow development of a site in conformance with the requirements of this Chapter
and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part
of the street can be secured. If a proposed development borders an existing half or
partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan.
H. Dead end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs (with adequate
turning capability) to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts or when
designed as cul-de-sacs.
I. Street names shall be coordinated with existing or planned street names.
If a new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or planned street,
it shall bear the same name as the existing or planned street.
J. All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective lengths
except where otherwise required by Council.
3. Street Design.

3. Performance Standards.
A. General. The following shall be considered the overriding performance
standard against which all proposes stormwater control measures shall be
evaluated:
(1) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or development
of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required:
(a) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities.
(b) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects
health and property from possible injury.
B. Watershed Standards.
(1) If the proposed development is located in a watershed for which a
stormwater management plan has been approves in accordance with the State
Storm Water Management Act (167 of 1978), 32 P.S. §680.1 et seq., then
stormwater runoff shall be handled in accordance with the standards and
criteria contained in the watershed plan.
(2) If the proposed development is located in a watershed for which a
there is no state-approved stormwater management plan, then stormwater
management facilities for the site shall control the peak stormwater discharge
for a range of design storms from the 2- to 100-year storm. The applicant's
engineer in consultation with the Borough Engineer shall determine the
design storms which shall be used, based on the capacity of existing obstructions
and system components. Type II Rainfall Distribution shall be used for
analyzing runoff in pre- and post-development conditions as well as for
designing runoff control facilities (except collection and conveyance systems).
4. Runoff Calculations.
A. For the purpose of computing peak flow rates and runoff hydrographs
from development sites and drainage areas larger than one acre, calculations shall
be performed using the methodologies presented in SCS publication, Technical
Release 55 (TR 55). For development sites less than 1 acre, the Rational Method
shall be utilized.
B. For the purposes of designing storm sewers, open swales and other runoff
collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational Method shall be applied. Rainfall
intensities for design should be obtained from the PennDOT rainfall charts.
5. Stormwater Detention Facilities.

post-development peak runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those
rates which shall be shown to prevent downstream harm under selected design
storms.
C. Facilities which provide detention of runoff for more than one development
site may be considered. Such facilities shall meet the criteria contained in this
Section. In addition, runoff from the development sites involved shall be conveyed
to the facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as flooding or erosion)
to channels and properties locates between the development site and the sharedstorage
facilities.
D. The use of lakes, ponds, ballfields or similar recreational areas to serve as
detention facilities is encouraged wherever feasible, subject to approval of the
municipality.
E. The following considerations shall be incorporated into the design of the
detention facilities:
(1) Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundment-type structures should be
protected from soil erosion.

sewers or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in accordance with
Borough specifications and the following basic standards:
(1) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and around
the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding damage.
(2) Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and French
drains to the curb line storm sewer (if applicable). Low side lots shall extend
roof and French drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance system or
§22-307 Subdivision and Land Development §22-307
22-27
natural watercourse in accordance with the approved stormwater management
plan for the development site.
(3) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel and
close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the possibility of
failing or causing the embankment to fail.
(4) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey the 25-
year storm peak flow rate from the contributing drainage area and carry it to
the nearest suitable outlet such as a curbed street, storm sewer or natural
watercourse.
(5) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall be
suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid excessive velocities.
B. Wherever utilized, storm sewers shall comply with Borough specifications
and the following guidelines:
(1) Where practical, designed to traverse under seeded and planted areas.
If constructed within 10 feet of road paving, walks or other surfaced areas,
drains shall have a narrow trench and maximum compaction of backfill to
prevent settlement of the superimposed surface or development.

swimming pool on any property in the Borough of Swissvale shall notify the Secretary
of the Borough of Swissvale in writing of the design and material of which same is

the said swimming pool.
(Ord. 74-4, 8/14/1974, §1)
§23-102. Purpose.
For the purpose of the Part, "family pool" is a swimming pool used or intended to
be used solely by the owner, operator or lessee thereof and his family, and by friends
invited to use it without the payment of any fee. “Swimming pool” shall be defined as
any man-made structure either in or out of the ground constructed for the purposes of
holding water to be used for swimming, bathing, other recreation or as a decorative or
landscape addition to the owner’s property. This definition shall include, but not be
limited to, in-ground pools, above ground pools, wading pools, fish ponds, landscape
ponds and any other man-made structures capable of retaining water for any purpose.
(Ord. 74-4, 8/14/1974, §2; as amended by Ord. 91-9, 8/14/1991)
§23-103. Construction Permit and Approval.

permit for the construction of same and the plans and specifications and pertinent
explanatory data shall be submitted to the Building Inspector of the Borough of
Swissvale for his approval, and no part of the work shall be commenced until the
Building Inspector has granted such approval by a suitable endorsement upon such
plans and specifications.

height, which shall be so constructed as to have no openings, holes or gaps larger than
4 inches in any dimension except for doors and gates, and if a picket fence is erected
or maintained, the horizontal dimension shall not exceed 4 inches. A dwelling house
or accessory building may be used as part of such enclosure. All gates or doors opening
through such enclosures shall be equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device
on the pool side for keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when not in
use, except that the door of any such dwelling which forms a part of the enclosure need
not be so equipped. The fence shall surround the pool and the deck area exclusively. It
shall be within 5 feet of the pool structure on two sides and a maximum of 20 feet on

determining the pro rata share of the tax, an employer shall round down the amount
of tax deducted for each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Each employer

§24-205 Taxation; Special §24-205
24-13 Supp. III; revised 12/28/2007
from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax
as required by this Section, or who fails to pay such tax to the collector, shall be liable
for such tax in full, as though the tax had originally been levied against such employer.
No employer shall be liable for failure to deduct the tax if the failure to deduct the tax
arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the employee’s place
or places of employment, the employee’s principal office or where the employee is
principally employed.
5. The employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records
concerning the employees in the cases described in subsections .5.A and .5.B.

received notification from the person who claimed the exemption or from the
collector that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar
year, and (4) the employer has not paid to the person earned income within the
Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year.
C. The employer shall file with the collector a copy of each exemption
certificate, including attachments, received by the employer no later than the end
of the first payroll period as to which the employee claims the exemption set forth
at §24-204.3.
D. If a person has claimed the exemption under §24-204.3 for a given calendar
year from the tax but either (1) the employer has received notification from the
person who claimed the exemption or from the collector that the person has
received earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or (2) the employer has paid
to the person earned income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year, then the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year and the employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification described in subparagraph
(1) above or for the first payroll period after payments described in
subparagraph (2) above have been made, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax
that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person,
plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax
withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year
shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this paragraph is
subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due and the collector may pursue collection under this
§24-205 Borough of Swissvale §24-209
Supp. III; revised 12/28/2007 24-14

collector and shall pay a pro rata share of the tax directly to the collector within 30 days

levied for the calendar year by four.

Part including, but not limited to, requirements for collection through employers,

correction of returns. The collector and agents designated by him may examine the
records of any employer or supposed employer or of any taxpayer or supposed taxpayer

fraction of month during which the tax remains unpaid, shall be added and collected.

24-14.1 Supp. III; added 12/28/2007
Whenever suit is brought for the recovery of unpaid tax, the taxpayer shall, in addition,
be liable for the costs of collection as well as for interest and penalties. The collector
may accept payment under protest of the tax claimed by the Borough in any case where

thereafter decides that there has been overpayment to the collector, the collector shall
refund the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid under protest.

becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged
in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which
requires the person working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the tax shall be in the following order: (A) first,
the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her principal office or is
principally employed; (B) second, the political subdivision in which the person resides
and works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; (C) third, the political
subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles
to the person’s home. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima
facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

which is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties.
Point source - any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including, but
not limited to, any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, or conduit from which stormwater
is discharged, as defined in State regulations at 25 Pa. Code §92.1.
Project site - the specific area of land where any regulated earth disturbance
activities in the Borough are planned, conducted or maintained.
Redevelopment - earth disturbance activities on land that has previously been
disturbed or developed.
Regulated earth disturbance activity - earth disturbance activity of one acre or
more with a point source discharge to surface waters or to the Borough's storm

State water quality requirements - as defined under State regulations –
protection of designated and existing uses (See 25 Pa.Code, Chapters 93 and 96)
- including:
(1) Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishery" or "potable water supply," which uses are listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained understate
§26-201 Stormwater §26-201
26-7
regulations.
(2) "Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth disturbance
activities must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
(3) Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be affected by pollutants such
as sediment, and changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or
rates as a result of changes in land surface area from those activities.
Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway, to
prevent adverse effects.
Stormwater - the surface runoff generated by precipitation reaching the
ground surface.
Surface waters of the Commonwealth - any and all rivers, streams, creeks,
rivulets, impoundments, ditches, watercourses, storm sewers, lakes, dammed
water, wetlands, ponds, springs, and all other bodies or channels of conveyance of
surface water, or parts thereof, whether natural or artificial, within or on the
boundaries of this Commonwealth.
Watercourse - a channel or conveyance of surface water, such as a stream or
creek, having defined bed and banks, whether natural or artificial, with perennial
or intermittent flow.
Watershed - region or area drained by a river, watercourse or other body of
water, whether natural or artificial.

§26-301. General Requirements for Stormwater Management.
1. All regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall be
designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes of this Chapter,
through these two elements:
A. Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance activities (for
example, during construction).
B. Water quality protection measures after completion of earth disturbance
activities (for example, after construction), including operation and maintenance.
2. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall commence
until the requirements of this Chapter are met.
3. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth disturbance activities
shall comply with §26-303.
4. Post-construction water quality protection shall comply with §26-304
Operations and maintenance of permanent stormwater BMPs shall comply with Part
4.
5. All best management practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements of this
Chapter shall conform to the State water quality requirements.
6. Techniques described in Appendix A, “Low Impact Development,” of this
Chapter are encouraged, because they reduce the costs of complying with the
requirements of this Chapter and the State water quality requirements.
(Ord. 04-02, 2/4/2004, §3.01)
§26-302. Permit Requirements by Other Government Entities.
The following permit requirements may apply to certain regulated earth
disturbance activities, and must be met prior to commencement of regulated earth
disturbance activities, as applicable:
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities subject to permit requirements
by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 102.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit requirements by
DEP under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or adjacent

26-10
(Ord. 04-02, 2/4/2004, §3.02)
§26-303. Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth Disturbance
Activities.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall commence
until approval by the Borough of an erosion and sediment control plan for construction
activities.
2. DEP regulations require an erosion and sediment control plan for any earth
disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa. Code §102.4(b).
3. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP "NPDES construction
activities" permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance activities
from the appropriate DEP regional office or County Conservation District must be
provided to the Borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit or permit
coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2) shall satisfy the requirements
of subsection .1.
5. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all times.
(Ord. 04-02, 2/4/2004, §3.03)
§26-304. Water Quality Requirements After Regulated Earth Disturbance
Activities Are Complete.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall commence
until approval by the Borough of a plan that demonstrates that State water quality
requirements will be satisfied after construction is complete.
2. The bmps must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet state water
quality requirements.
3. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, State water quality requirements can be met by BMPs,
including site design, which provide for replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration and runoff conditions, so that post-construction stormwater discharges do
not degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters.
As described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the following:
A. Infiltration. Replication of pre-construction stormwater infiltration
conditions.
B. Treatment. Use of water quality treatment BMPs to filter chemical and
physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff.
C. Streambank and Streambed Protection. Management of volume and rate
of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation of
receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
4. DEP regulations require municipalities to ensure design, implementation and
maintenance of best management practices ("BMPs") that control runoff from new
development and redevelopment after regulated earth disturbance activities are
§26-304 Stormwater §26-304
26-11

Appendix A
Low Impact Development Practices
Alternative Approach for
Managing Stormwater Runoff
Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered by poorly planned development
practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces, destroying existing
drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers, and changing local
topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff
from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin. This approach
leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of
additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some
downstream location.
The recommended alternative is to promote practices that will minimize
postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes, which in turn will minimize needs for
artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development hydrologic
conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by
creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the
soil types and its conditions.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design
considerations. Site design practices include preserving natural drainage features,
minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious
surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage. A well-designed site will contain
a mix of all those features. The following describes various techniques to achieve the
alternative approach:
Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features,
particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of their
ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants. However, this
objective is often not accomplished in land development. In fact, commonly held
drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern - streets and adjacent
storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales,
thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system.
As a result, runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow
directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or
filtration. Developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount
of grading on site.
Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas have
no surface outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be
commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large
runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by
filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff
volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate characteristics of
depressions should be protected in the design of the development site. The
depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating
its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities.
Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should
consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building
26-26
footprints, sidewalks, driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces
should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces. Impervious
surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an
impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two basic ways to reduce
hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use
of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater
runoff, and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the
development.
Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns
in most site designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to
storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping driveways and
parking lots to the street. By routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run
off to the lawn, the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip.
Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing use of storm sewers for
draining streets, parking lots, and back yards, the potential for accelerating runoff
from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice requires greater use of
swales and may not be practical for some development sites, especially if there are
concerns for areas that do not drain in a "reasonable" time. The practice requires
educating local citizens and public works officials, who expect runoff to disappear
shortly after a rainfall event.
Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating
on-street parking or by reducing roadway widths. Municipal planners and traffic
designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could
lower maintenance.
Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the
street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be replaced
with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where appropriate,
backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials.
Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such materials
should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces, especially
for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking lots, and emergency
access roads.
Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and
entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic streets where traffic
noise is not a problem.
Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also reduce the
amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings is in
street length, which also will reduce costs of the development. Cluster development
clusters the construction activity onto less-sensitive areas without substantially
affecting the gross density of development.
In summary, a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation
of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of
costly stormwater control measures. Other benefits include reduced potential of
downstream flooding, water quality degradation of receiving streams/water bodies and
enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs. Beneficial results
26-27
include more stable baseflows in receiving streams, improved groundwater recharge,
reduced flood flows, reduced pollutant loads, and reduced costs for conveyance and
storage.

of this Chapter shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this
Chapter; and to the extent that said unlawful structure or use is in conflict with the

3. In interpreting the language of this Chapter to determine the extent of the
restriction upon the use of the property, the language shall be interpreted, where doubt
exists as to its intended meaning, in favor of the property owner and against any

which they are located, unless otherwise specified in this Chapter.
§27-408 Zoning §27-408
27-49
C. Location. Required off street parking spaces shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the structure or use that they serve unless a joint use or off-site
parking plan is approved (see paragraphs .H or .I below).

H. Joint Use of Parking Spaces.
(1) Two or more uses may share a common parking area provided the
total spaces equal or exceed the sum of the spaces required for each use
individually. However, the Planning Commission may approve a joint parking
plan which permits a reduction in this total subject to the following:
(a) A written report shall be prepared by the applicant which clearly
demonstrates that one or more uses require parking at times when other
uses in the building or complex are not normally in operation and,
§27-408 Borough of Swissvale §27-408
27-50
therefore, the uses could share parking, thus reducing the total spaces
that otherwise would be required for all uses.
(b) Not more than 50% of the required parking spaces for any one use
shall be supplied jointly with other uses, except that up to 100% of the
spaces for a place of worship or school may be supplied jointly with
another use.

the continued availability of the joint parking spaces to all proposed uses.
(2) This joint parking provision shall not apply to shopping centers.
(3) Any change or expansion of the uses sharing the joint parking area
shall require a new review by the Planning Commission and may result in
additional spaces being required and a revised agreement with the Borough.
(4) Continued compliance with approved joint parking plan is a condition
of occupancy; any violation thereof may result in the suspension or revocation
of the occupancy permit.
I. Off-site Parking Facilities. The Planning Commission may approve a plan
for providing all or some of the required off-street parking spaces on a lot other
than where the principal use is located, provided that:
(1) Both lots are held in the same ownership, or a lease has been executed
for the spaces which guarantees their availability for as long as the use exists.
Evidence of ownership or a copy of the lease shall be filed with the Borough.
(2) The off-site parking spaces are located within 350 feet distance from
the principal use and connected by a safe pedestrian walkway.
(3) The continued availability of the approved off-site parking shall be a
condition of occupancy for the principal use which they serve; any violation
thereof may result in the suspension or revocation of the principal use's
occupancy permit.
J. Parking for Recreational Vehicles. A recreational vehicle shall be parked
or stored in an off-street parking space complying with the applicable
requirements of this Chapter.

A. When calculating the required number of spaces, a fractional space of one
half or over shall be considered an entire space while a fraction below one half may
be disregarded.
B. In the case of a single- or two-family residence or townhouse unit, a
driveway for the dwelling may count as one off street parking space, provided such
parking does not block access to parking for another dwelling.
C. Wherever employee parking is required by this Section, it shall be
calculated based on the number of employees on a peak shift.
D. The following shall be the minimum number of parking spaces required;

authorization for or approval of the continuance of the use of structure or premises in
violation of zoning regulations in effect at the time of the effective date of this Chapter.
3. Alterations, Repair, Enlargement, Reconstruction, Moving of Nonconforming
Structures (Excluding Signs).
A. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by a proper

within the existing building.
E. A nonconforming structure or building shall not be moved to any other
location on the lot or any other lot unless every portion of such structure, the use

permit has been obtained in accordance with this Chapter and the Borough Building
Code [Chapter 5, Part 1].
3. Liability.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas
outside the floodplain areas or that land uses permitted with such areas will be
free from flooding flood damages.
B. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough or any
office or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. [Ord. 05-02]
4. Delineation of Floodplain Areas.
A. Overlay Concept. The floodplain areas described in this Section shall be
overlays to the underlying zoning districts shown on the Official Zoning Map. The
provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying
§27-502 Borough of Swissvale §27-502
27-60
district provisions. Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions
or requirements of any of the floodplain districts and those of any underlying
districts, the more restrictive provisions.
B. Description of Floodplain Areas. The various floodplain overlay districts
shall include areas subject to inundation by waters of the 100-year flood. These
areas are shown on the most current Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) prepared for the Borough by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
C. Changes in Floodplain Area Delineations. The identified floodplain area
may be revised or modified by Council where studies or information by a qualified
agency or person documents the need or possibility for such revision. Prior to any
such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
D. Interpretation of Area Boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries
of the floodplain areas shall be made by the Zoning Officer. Should a dispute arise
concerning any boundary, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the
determination. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
5. Floodplain Provisions.
A. No construction or development shall take place within any identified
floodplain area of the Borough.
B. Repairs, improvements or modifications to an existing structure which
amount to less than 50% of the market value are permitted provided such work
does not result in the expansion or enlargement of the structure.
6. Variances.
A. If compliance with any of the requirements of this Chapter would result
in an exceptional hardship for a prospective builder, developer, or landowner, the
Zoning Hearing Board may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application
of the requirements. Requests for variances shall be considered in accordance with
the provisions of Part 6 of this Chapter.
B. Not withstanding the provisions of this Section, no variance shall be
granted for any of the following:
(1) The construction, enlargement or expansion of any structure used, or
intended to be used for a hospital, nursing home, jail or prison.
(2) A new mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, or substantial
improvement to an existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision.
(3) A new salvage yard or any expansion to an existing one.

the production or storage of any of the following dangerous materials or
substances; or will be used for any activity requiring the maintenance of a
supply of more than 550 gallons, or other comparable volume, of any of the
following dangerous materials or substances on the premises; or will involve
the production, storage, or use of any amount of radioactive substances. The
following list of materials and substances are considered dangerous to human
life:

5A mere showing of economic hardship alone does not justify the granting of a variance. [See Hansen Properties
v. Zoning Board of Horsham Township, 566 A.2d 926 (Pa. Cmwlth., 1989)]. A landowner must show that the physical
characteristics of his/her property are such that it cannot be used for any permitted purpose, or for a permitted purpose
only at prohibitive expense, rendering the property valueless if the variance is not granted.

irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and
that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not to be
circumstances generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter; and the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship had not been created by the appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor
be detrimental to the public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
which will afford relief and represent the least modification possible of the
regulation in issue.
3. Planning Commission Comments. The Board shall request the review and
comments of the Planning Commission on any variance application, which shall be
made part of the public record.
4. Conditions. The Board may attach to any variance such reasonable conditions

developed in compliance with this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
B. Permit the use of land or structure contrary to the use provisions of the
applicable zoning district.
C. Permit an increase in the otherwise allowable area of the sign by more
10%.
[Ord. 93-4]

1. Authority. The Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions
in accordance with such standards and criteria as specified in Part 3 of this Chapter.
2. Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter,
as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this Chapter.
3. Planning Commission Comment. The Board shall request the review and
comments of the Planning Commission on any application for a special exception,
which shall be made part of the public record.

FOREWORD
History1
This comprises the original codification of the ordinances of the Borough of
Swissvale as prepared for the Borough and published by Keystate Publishers, Inc., and
was adopted by Ordinance 05-02 on Jun 1, 2005 by the Borough Council of the Borough
of Swissvale. Swissvale was known as a “hamlet” from 1850 to 1866. Following this
period, the title was changed to “The Village” and this name clung to the community
from 1866 to 1898. On July, 30, 1898, the village was incorporated into a Borough to
be known as the “Borough of Swissvale.”
About the time the first gun was fired on Fort Sumter, announcing to the world the
beginning of the Civil War, the beauties of the sylvan hamlet of Swissvale, situated in
Wilkins Township, were being brought to the attention of many of the people of
Pittsburgh.
At the time, surrounded by fertile and well kept farms, the wooded hills, bountiful
orchards and waving field of grain, provided a picturesque and delightful setting for the
dozen or so homes which formed the hamlet of Swissvale.
Jane Grey Swisshelm lived in a log house adjoining the Haven property, in what was
known as the Nine Mile Run Hollow. She so loved this beautiful hamlet, that she
bestowed upon it the name of Swissvale and that is how our Borough received its
present name. Mrs. Swisshelm’s activities as a writer and one of the propmoters of the
Underground Railroad for the succor of slaves fleeing from the South to the North and
into Canada for freedom, earned for her fame and prestige which will remain and
endure as a part of the history of western Pennslyvania.
John McKelvy owned and operated one of the finest farms in the Township, at that
time. The broad acres comprising his farm covered the greater part of what is now
known as the Hill District of Swissvale.
The Robert Milligan Farm occupied that section of what is now the Borough lying
East of Dickson Street and Westmoreland Avenue to the section of Braddock and
Woodstock Avenues, and from Milligan Avenue into what is now Rankin Borough.
The Samuel Deniston farm occupied all that territory from what is now Carrie
Street, west to McClure Avenue and from Monongahela Avenue to the Monogahela
River.
The Thomas Dickson farms lay between what is now McClure Avenue and the Nine
Mile Run, and extended from Monongahela Avenue to Nevada Street in the North
Homestead district.
The Alexander Gordon and J.S. Newmyer homestead covered what is known as the
Hill District from Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way, west of Westmoreland Avenue
and extended into what is now Edgewood Borough.
The farms of James Swisshelm, husband of Jane Grey Swisshelm, lay between the
Haven property and the Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way on the north, and the
-viii-
Deniston and Dickson farms on the South, and from what is now Carrie Street to the
Nine Mile Run.
The farm of Colonel William G. Hawkins, adjoining the Milligan farm on the west,
extended east to Tassey Hollow and south into, and covering, a large portion of what
is now known as Rankin Borough.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the
Borough of Swissvale contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which lists
by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time" nature, (3) the Key to the
disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Borough of Swissvale, and (4) the
Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can
be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each Chapter. The Index
may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on
a particular subject, or if it is not known in which Chapter the subject might be found.
The Appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronological listing
of short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its
date of enactment, if known.
The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough of
Swissvale Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance
has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is
located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in the Appendix. Annual tax
rate and budget ordinances are located only in the Key. The Key is a cross reference
to the original ordinance books of the Borough of Swissvale, and to the location within
the Code of each ordinance by number.

Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed
as part of the Flood Insurance Study
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments are hereby
adopted by Borough of Swissvale and declared to be a part of this ordinance.
Section 4.02 Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway
and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one (1) foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway
areas which have been identified in other available studies or sources of information for
those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and
FIRM.
1. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development shall be pennitted unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis perfonned in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed,
9
unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
1. The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other
acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is
not available, the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction
site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
Section 4.03 Changes in Identification of Area
The Identified Floodplain Area may be revised or modified by the Borough Council where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such
revision. However, prior to any such change to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months
after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the Special Flood Hazard Area by submitting technical or scientific data. See 5.01 (B)
for situations where FEMA notification is required.
Section 4.04 Boundary Disputes
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination
shall be made by the Borough of Swissvale and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
10
Section 4.05 Jurisdictional Boundary Changes
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes
are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands
subject to boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR
44 60.3.

A. Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse
1. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such
action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required permits or
approvals have first been obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
2. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
3. In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of
any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
• any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway;
or
• any development occurring in Zones Al-30 and Zone AE without a designated
flood way, which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or
• alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and
bridges)
the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
1. apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur.
2. Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior
to approving the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to
FEMA of the adoption of floodplain management ordinances incorporating the
11
increased base flood elevations and I or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
3. Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide asbuilt
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such
certifications in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.

by the Borough in any case where any person disputes the Borough's claim for the tax. If a

collector, then the collector shall refund the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid
under protest.

PNC Bank, National Association (the "Purchaser") hereby offers to purchase, and the
above-named Municipality (the "Local Government Unit"), hereby agrees, by adoption of a proper

dated, in the principal amount, bearing interest at the rate, payable at maturity on December 31, 2009 and
subject to early redemption or prepayment, as set forth in the Terms attached to the Transmittal and
Certificate attached to the Note Resolution. The Note will have the further terms and provisions as
contained in the Note Resolution and in this Proposal.
In consideration of the Purchaser's obligation to purcl1ase the Note, the Local
Government Unit shall pay the Purchaser an Origination Fee at the rate stated in the Terms on the
principal amount of the Note. All notice, filing and legal fees incurred in connection with the issuance
and sale of the Note, as provided in !he Note Resolution or as contemplated by this Proposal, except for
the fee of Note Counsel, if any, shall be paid by the Local Government Unit.
Upon at least five (5) business days prior written notice to the Purchaser, the Local
Government Unit has the right to prepay all or part of the outstanding principal and interest on the Note.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, upon any prepayment by or on behalf of the
Local Government Unit (whether voluntary, on default or otherwise), the Purchaser may require, if it so
elects, the Local Government Unit to pay the Purchaser as compensation for the cost of being prepaid an
amount equal to the Cost of Prepayment. "Cost of Prepayment" means an amount eq1ial to the present
value, if positive, of the product of (a) the difference between (i) the yield, on tlie beginning date of the
applicable interest period, of a U.S. Treasury obligation with a maturity similar to the applicable interest
period minus (ii) the yield on the prepayment date, of a U.S. Treasury obligation with a maturity similar
to the remaining maturity of the applicable interest period, and (b) the principal amount to be prepaid, and
(c) the number of years, including fractional years, from the prepayment date to the end of the applicable
interest period. The yield on any U.S. Treasury obligation shall be determined by reference to Federal
Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) "Selected Interest Rates." For purposes of making present value
calculations, the yield to maturily of a similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligation on the prepayment date
shall be deemed tlie discount rate. The Cost of Prepayment shall also apply to any payments made after
acceleration of the maturity of the Note.
The Note is being purchased on tlie assumption that interest paid on the Note is excludablc
from the gross income of the registered owner for Federal income ta.x purposes. If interest on tl1e Note shall
be declared by the Internal Revenue Service or an agent thereof to be, or shall otlierwise be determined or
required to be includable in tlie income of the Purchaser for purposes of Federal income ta.xation, including
pursuant to any amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the indebtedness evidenced
thereby shall therear1er bear interest at an annual rate (the "Ta.>:able Rate") which shall be tl1e Prime Rate of
PNC Bank, National Association, such Ta.xable Rate to change as of the dates of changes in the Prime Rate
without notice to the Local Government Unit; the Local Government Unit will pay to the Purchaser on

at the Ta.xable Rate ifthe indebtedness evidenced by the Note had borne interest at the Ta.xable Rate during
the entire period that interest on the Note is so declared, determined or required to be ta.<:able, together with
such penalties and interest, if any, due and payable because of non-payment of Federal income ta.xation le55
interest paid at the rate stated in the Terms of Proposal notwithstanding that the indebtedness evidenced by
the Note may have been paid in full prior to such declaration or determination. In the event of any such
declaration or determination, the Purchaser shall promptly give written notice of the same to the Local
Government Lfnit \Yho shall have the .privilege of contesting such declaration or dt::(errninalion in tht: name
of tlie Purchaser by any available administrative or judicial proceedings, provided tliat it does so at its own
expense and pays all costs, interest .and/or penalties resulting therefrom. In the event that any such
declaration or determination is reversed pursuant to tl1c entry of a final determination, order, ruling or
decree, all amounts theretofore paid td the Purchaser in excess of the rate stated in the Terms of Proposal
shall be promptly refunded to the Local Government Unit and the rate of interest shall revert lo the rate
stated in the Terms of Proposal.
To enhance the creditwo11hiness and negotiability of the Note, the Purchaser may
simultaneously upon any delivery of any Note to a third party investor, issue an irrevocable Letter of
Credit (or execute and deliver some other similar put, collateral or guaranty agreement), in an amount
equal to the principal amount of, plus interest on, the Note for the account of the Local Government Unit
and to and for the benefit of the third party investor. Such an event shall create a duty in the Local
Govermnent Unit to execute and deliver certain credit applications(s) or agrecment(s) as provided in the
Nole Resolution.
As conditions precedent to the obligation of the Purchaser to purchase the Note, the Local
Government Unit shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, the following

RE: Enterprise Zone Re-designation/Status
Enclosed is a proposed resolution and Amendment #1 to the Cooperation Agreement between the Boroughs of
Braddock, North Braddock, Rankin and Swissvale and the Enterprise Zone Corp. of Braddock for continued
Enterprise Zone designation and funding.
As you may recall, this Enterp1ise Zone has been re-designated through July 1, 2015. Each contract year we must
submit a request for continued designation and fonding.
This year the EZCB initiated the Green Development Initiative. We convened a Business Roundtable among local
businesses interested in Green Development and have contacted or been contacted by prospective "green" businesses
interested in what we're advocating and the area. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved $800 million in
fonding for Green Development activities under the Alternative Energy Investment Act of2008. We see some
opportunities for the use of frmds in this area.
In Green Development, the EZCB has approved an Enterprise Zone loan of $50,000 to Fossil Free Fuel, LLC, located
at 223 Braddock Avenue, Braddock. These fonds are part of a $100,000 investment in the business to purchase
equipment, inventory, working capital and other business assets. Tlu·ee (3) to five (5) new jobs are to be created.
The EZCB is initiating the Business Energy Efficiency Program (BEEP) to assist local businesses through energy
midi ts. We have been asked if energy audit f1mding could be available for public buildings. We are looking into
possible sources of fonding.
The Southwestern Pennsylvania Corporation has contracted with the EZCB to conduct business surveys of local
businesses as part of the state-wide Pennsylvania Business Retention and Expansion Program.
As Swissvale is new to the Enterp1ise Zone, we've recently held meetings with development groups in Swissvale to
advise on Enterprise Zone incentives.
Finally, the EZCB awarded Image and Beautification grants to the following:
• Grow Pittsburgh's Urban Garden on Braddock Avenue, Braddock
• $500 to Swissvale Crimewatch for new Cluistmas lights in the business district.
If you have any questions please contact the EZCB office.

WHEREAS, PAMS is the earned income tax collector appointed by Swissvale Borough
Council and enggges in ongoing collection of the current and delinquent eameci income taxes

WHEREAS, Swissvale Borough Council has determined that providing an amnesty
period for the month of September, 2009 during which delinquent tax payers could make

encourage payment of delinqueni taxes and provide needed additional revenue to the Borough

iaxes by receiving a commission of 1.9% on all amounts collected, including principal, interest
and penalty, as well as receipt of fees for each collection year that are imposed on the

the principal is due would substantially reduce PAMS's ability to retain and receive

the earned income taxes collected during ihe amnesty period in September, 2009 as follows:
1. This alternative compensation program for PAMS shall apply only to delinquent

community-based effort to save Braddock Hospital.

RE: RA TE RESOLUTIO.N- 2010 BUDGET
Dear Mr. Facareta:
November I 0, 2009
VIA CERTIFIED MAIL
The need to fund mandated sewer infrastructure projects along with increased daily operating costs
have necessitated a 7 percent ALCOSAN rate increase effective January I, 2010. The new
resolution is enclosed for your reference.
The new rates increase the basic service charge by $0.27, from $3 .77 to $4.04 for each thousand
gallons of water used and the service charge by $0.56, from $7.92 to $8.48 per bill issued. The
average customer, who uses 18,000 gallons of water per quarter, will pay $5.42 more for a threemonth
service period, increasing their quarterly charge from $75 .78 to $81.20 The rates for those
businesses.that are subject to effluent surcharges, use a commercial disposal, or accounts that have
auxiliary meters will remain the same.
Having chosen the alternate method of billing, as provided in the Allegheny County Sanitary
Authority sewage agreement, your municipality. has agreed to pay ALCOSAN sewage charges for
the properties located within your municipality.
The agreement requires the municipality to provide in its annual budget funds equal to at least
120% of the amount ALCOSAN estimates will become due within such year. For the 20 IO calendar
year, the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority estimates the requirement to be $928,080.00, which
at 120% is $1,113,696.00.
The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority hereby requests that your municipality take timely and
appropriate action to collect or obtain during 20 I 0, by any lawful means, the sum of at least
$1, 113,696.00. This money shall be deposited in a restricted "Sewage Agency Fund" which is to
be used for the purpose of meeting the municipality's wastewater collection system requirements.
lfyou have any questions or concerns regarding the estimated budget for 2010, please contact
Kathy Morvay at 412-734-8366 or kathleen.morvay@alcosan.org.

Allegheny County Sanitary Authority

A RESOLUTION OF THE BOROUGH OF SWISSVALE,
COUNTY OF ALLEGHENY, COMMONWEALTH OF
PENNSYLVANIA, IN OPPOSITION TO FORCED
MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
WHEREAS, local municipalities are excellent fiscal stewards that have been doing more
with less ever since the days of William Penn and are run by elected ofiicials that live and work
in the communities they represent, and are more committed to pinching pennies and working
together to stretch tax dollars than anyone else in government today; and
WHEREAS, various special interests suggest that there are too many local governments
in Pennsylvania and that reducing this figure through forced boundary change will somehow lead
to greater economic conditions and the better delivery of services in the Commonwealth; and
WHEREAS, no one has ever proven that bigger, centralized government is better or
even more cost-effective than borough government; and
WHEREAS, governments that rely on consolidated county-based governments generally
have higher tax burdens than smaller governments; and
WHEREAS, recent reports of financially distressed municipalities in Pennsylvania are
largely limited to the Commonwealth's large cities and urban areas; and
WHEREAS, HB 2431 (Session of 20 I 0) would, if adopted, change the Pennsylvania
Constitution and establish the county as the basic level oflocal goverrunent in Pennsylvania,
with municipalities existing only under the jurisdiction of the county and having only those
duties and responsibilities as determined by the county; and
WHEREAS, SB 1357 (Session of 20 I 0) would, if adopted, establish an unelected,
statewide boundary commission to review and make conclusions to the General Assembly for
the merger, consolidation, or annexation of municipalities; and
WHEREAS, the Borough of Swissvale supports the voluntary merger or consolidation of
local governments ifthe process is initiated at the local level and it has the support of the
majority of the residents of all affected municipalities.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council of the Borough of
Swissvale, County of Allegheny, opposes any measure, initiative, or plan that mandates the
forced merger or consolidation of local governments; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the General Assembly be urged to oppose HB
I
2431, SB 1357 and any similar legislation that has been or may in the future be introduced that
would weaken the responsiveness and/or effectiveness oflocal governments.

Appendix A
Illustration of Modified Scoring System
When Two (2) or More Applicants Take the \Vritten Examination for the position of
Sergeant, Lieutenant and Assistant Fire Chief
Assume that the Commission's written examination for the position of Sergeant, Lieutenant and
Assistant Fire Chief contains 120 questions.
Candidate A answers 80 questions correctly. Candidate B answers 70 questions correctly.
Candidate C answers 60 questions correctly. Candidate D answers 40 questions correctly.
Under the Modified Scoring System, each candidate will have 40 extra points added to their
respective scores to comply with Section 5.3. [This additional 40 points credited to the highest
scoring applicant equals the total number of points required as if the highest scoring applicant
answered every question on the written examination correctly. This same number of additional
points also is added to the total number of questions that the other applicants answered
correctly].
Thus, Candidate A would be credited with 120 points (80 questions answered correctly plus 40
additional points). Candidate B would be credited with 110 points (70 questions answered
correctly plus 40 additional points). Candidate C would be credited with 100 points (60
questions answered correctly plus 40 additional points). Candidate D would be credited with 80
points (40 questions answered correctly plus 40 additional points).
As required by Section 5.3, these scores then must be expressed as a percentage by dividing the
credited number of points by the total number of questions on the written examination.
If 120 questions were on the written examination, the scores of the three candidates expressed as
a percentage would be as follows:
Candidate A 120 credited points+ 120 questions= 100%
Candidate B 110 credited points+ 120 questions = 92%
Candidate C 100 credited points+ 120 questions= 83%
Candidate D 80 credited points+ 120 questions= 67%
Because their respective modified scores are 70% or above, Candidates A, B and C would be
considered to have passed the written examination and are able to take the oral examination.
Because his modified score is less than 70%, Candidate D would be rejected

RE: RATE RESOLUTION- 2012 BUDGET VIA CERTIFIED MAIL
David W. Fkwneman, P.E. Dear Ms. Ford:
Director
Arthur Trriffia, Esq.
Ettglutering &Construction
Ellyrronmemyinvagmr DI rector has necessitated a 7 percent ALCOSAN rate increase effective January 1, 2012. The new resolution is
The need to fund mandated sewer infrastructure projects along with increased daily operating costs
enclosed for your reference.
The new rates increase the basic service charge by $0.28, from $4,04 to $4.32 for each thousand
gallons of water used and the service charge by $0.59, from $8,48 to $9.07 per bill issued. The
average customer, who uses 15,000 gallons of water per quarter, will pay $4.79 more for a threemonth
service period, increasing their quarterly charge from $69.08 to $73.87, The rates for effluent
surcharges, commercial disposals and auxiliary meters will remain the same.
Having chosen the alternate method of billing, as provided in the Allegheny County Sanitary
Authority sewage agreement, your municipality has agreed to pay ALCOSAN sewage charges for the
properties located within your municipality.
The agreement requires the municipality to provide in its annual budget funds equal to at least 120%
of the amount ALCOSAN estimates will become due within such year. For the 2012 calendar year,
the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority estimates the requirement for your municipality to be
$949,118,19, which at 120% is $1,138,941.83,
The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority hereby requests that your municipality take timely and
appropriate action to collect: or obtain during 2012, by any lawful means, the sum of at least
$1,138,941,83. This money shall be deposited in a restricted "Sewage Agency Fund" which is to be
used for the purpose of meeting the municipality's wastewater collection system requirements.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the estimated budget for 2012, please contact Dan
Thornton at 412-734-8168 or dartiel.thornton@alcosan.org.

Dear Ms. Ford :
It has come to my attention through an email from Alcosan that Alcosan is raising
sewage rates 7% to its surrounding communities. Please be advised that our contract
with the Borough of Swissvale (section 6 part (A) (2) Change in Rate or Procedure)
requires 60 days notice from your community before we will pass on or enact any rate
changes to sewage customer in your community. Also, there is a provision that
prohibits any community from requiring Wilkinsburg-Perm Joint Water to
retroactively bill any charges. I do not know the exact details of the increase but
assume that Alcosan has notified you in detail of the increase. I will need
confirmation from you indicating that you want this increase passed on to your sewage
customers and the actual components and amounts that make up the increase. A copy
of any information Alcosan has sent you regarding the rate increase should suffice. If
I do not hear from you by December 14, 2011 I will assume that you are not passing
the increase on to your residents. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am
trying to protect your community by being proactive in this matter. I hope you will
provide me with information on your wishes regarding this increase. We will not be
able to retroactively bill sewage charges for your community if you decide at a later
date to implement the new Alcosan charges.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation,
Cc: Anthony Russo

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authority is
hereby authorized to bill increased rates charged by Allegheny County Sanitary Authority to
Swissvale Borough residents in accordance with their contract.

provides for a uniform statewide system for establishing property values among all counties in
the Commonwealth so that all residents, businesses, governments and school districts are
afforded stability, certainty and fairness.
WHEREAS, in Clifton, et.al, v. Allegheny County, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled
that base-year reassessment systems inherently become increasingly inaccurate over time, and
further, that Allegheny County's base-year system, as applied, was unconstitutionally nonuniform;
and
WHEREAS, although the decision indicated that allowing thehase-yeat assessment
system to stand indefinitely was a problem that needed to be addressed on a statewide basis, the
Supreme Court also acknowledged that there had been no actionby the General Assembly and
ordered the Court to oversee a reassessment of property in Allegheny County; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court decision, and the lack of actionh-y the General
Assembly, has resulted in Allegheny County being unfairly singled-out and s*oete6 to a cok,y,t_
ordered reassessment that is bringing uncertainty and fear to residents, businesses, go-vatments
and school districts throughout the county; and
WHEREAS, the specific targeting of Allegheny County's residential and-business
property taxpayers for disparate treatment will have a negative economic impact on the county,
resulting in reduced economic development and spending within the county, -which will testi in
reduced state income through sales and use taxes, fuel taxes, and income and other tzakes., and
WHEREAS, there is no difference between the base-year assessment system, that

expeditiously impose a statewide moratorium on singled-out, court-ordered county reassessments
to ensure that no residents, businesses, governments or school districts are unfairly treated.

COUNTY EXECUTIVE
January 12, 2012
Dear Elected Officials:
I write today to urge you to join me in opposing the ongoing court-ordered reassessment by
passing a resolution asking the Court to stop this reassessment, while simultaneously calling on
the. Governor and General Assembly to impose a moratorium on singled-out, court-ordered
county reassessments until there is a statewide law that provides for uniformity among all
counties in the Commonwealth.
As you know, Allegheny County is in the midst of a court-ordered reassessment in which only
information for the City of Pittsburgh and Mt. Oliver Borough has been released to date. There
have been numerous stories about the large numbers, substantial increases and shocking
values from just those properties. This is the first update of values in a decade, and the
increases are simply terrifying to some property owners. While Allegheny County residents are
dealing with the uncertainty and fear of fighting to ensure that a fair value is placed on their
properties, our neighboring counties have been able to keep their old numbers for decades.
There is no difference between the base-year system that Allegheny County has used and the
base-year system used by surrounding counties, but the Supreme Court believes otherwise.
Our county can no longer be discriminated against and targeted for these reassessments. Our
county and its municipalities will, again, see residents and businesses migrate to our
neighboring counties. The hard work we have done to stabilize property assessments and
promote economic growth during the last decade has shown results. Prior to 2002, Allegheny
County lagged the nation in property value appreciation, but we have seen those values
stabilized during the last five years, while national property values have fallen by 3,8 percent.
Also, over the last four years, we have been among the lowest in the nation in home
foreclosures and sheriff's sales. We cannot allow the Allegheny County-only court-ordered
reassessment to reverse our progress.

Resolution approving the intermunicipal transfer of the liquor license prior to an applicant's
submission of an application to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board; and
WHEREAS, the Liquor Code stipulates that, prior to adoption of a Resolution by the

for FY 2014; and
WHEREAS, since FY 2001 , funding for the CDBG formula has declined by nearly 36%, causing
Allegheny County to lose over $7.2 Million in CDBG funding over that period; and
WHEREAS, the FY 2015 proposed 7.59% reduction in CDBG funding would represent an
additional $1 .0 Million loss in CDBG funding to Allegheny County and would dramatically affect projects
and programs that help sustain Allegheny County's municipalities, non-profits and its low and moderate
income residents; and
WHEREAS, Allegheny County's CDBG program has a long-term objective of developing viable
urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic
opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income; and
WHEREAS, in Allegheny County, an average of 73% of CDBG funds go to or benefit low to
moderate income residents of the County; and
WHEREAS, communities in Allegheny County rely heavily upon the CDBG program to alleviate
blight in the communities, provide affordable housing, make public buildings accessible to all residents of
the community, provide funds for infrastructure needs that our municipality would otherwise be unable to
do, and allow elected officials to conduct planning that will transition their neighborhoods to a more
diverse, broad-based, 21 51 century economy; and
WHEREAS, the Allegheny County Community Development Block Grant Program funds a myriad
of social service, economic development, and housing programs in this community which have resulted
in the development of a strong network of relationships between this local government, the County's
residents, and the many non-profit agencies that provide services and help make possible our
commitment to those neighborhoods.

BOROUGH OF SWISSVALE
--. Martin F. Busch
President of Council
FUND BALANCE POLICY
A. PURPOSE
To establish a fund balance/retained earnings policy tailored to the needs
of the Borough of Swissvale to insure against unanticipated events that
would adversely affect the financial condition of the Borough of Swissvale
and jeopardize the continuation of necessary public services. This policy
will ensure the Borough of Swissvale maintains adequate fund
balance/retained earnings and reserves in the Borough of Swissvale's
various operating funds for the Borough of Swissvale to: (1) provide
sufficient cash flow for daily financial needs, (2) secure and maintain the
ability to incur indebtedness when necessary, (3) offset significant
economic downturns or revenue shortfalls, (4) provide funds for
unforeseen expenditures related to emergencies, and (5) provide funds for
making capital improvements/purchases.
B. DEFINITIONS
a. Fund Balance - the cumulative difference of all revenues and
expenditures.
b. Reserved Fund Balance - portion of the Fund Balance that is
legally restricted to a specific use or otherwise not available for
appropriation or expenditure.
c. Unreserved Fund Balance - a measure of how much Fund
Balance is left over at the end of the current fiscal year which can
be used for the subsequent fiscal year's budget.
d. Appropriated Designated Fund Balance - portion of the
Unreserved Fund Balance which reflects tentative management
plans for future use of monies.
e. Appropriated Undesignated Fund Balance - portion of the

f. Unreserved Unappropriated Fund Balance - portion of the
Unreserved Fund Balance which is not obligated or specifically
designated and can be used to meet contingencies and working
capital requirements.
C. POLICY
The Borough of Swissvale will establish and maintain a reserve of fund
balance in each of the various governmental and proprietary funds. For
purposes of initially establishing the balance and maintaining hereafter,
the Borough of Swissvale shall retain the minimum requirement for each
fund. Additional funds will be retained in the Unreserved Fund Balance to
the extent available to reach target levels.
D. FUND BALANCE GOALS
a. General Fund - In the General Fund, there shall be maintained an
Unreserved Unappropriated Fund Balance equivalent to a minimum
of five percent (5%) of the current fiscal year expenditures less
capital outlay and transfers out budgeted for the fund. For
purposes of this calculation, the expenditures shall be the budget
as originally adopted for the subsequent fiscal year. This reserve
shall be in addition to all other required reserves or designation of
fund balance.
b. Special Revenue Funds - Special revenue funds are created to
account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are
legally restricted to expenditure for specified purposes. No specific
reservation of Fund Balance is created by virtue of enactment of
this policy. The amount of any reservation of Fund Balance shall
be governed by the legal authority underlying the creation of the
individual funds.
c. Debt Service Fund - Debt service funds are typically subjected to
the creation of very specific reserve amounts as part of the
ordinance or resolution which authorizes the borrowing. This policy
does not create any specific reservation of Fund Balance within any
Debt Service Fund. Reserve requirements for any outstanding debt
will be consistent with the ordinance or resolution authorizing the
borrowing.
d. Capital Projects Fund - The Capital Projects Fund is created to
account for resources designated to construct or acquire general
fixed assets and major improvements. These projects may extend
beyond a single fiscal year. No specific reserve requirement is
established for the Capital Projects Fund. However, at a minimum,
the fiscal year end Reserved Fund Balance, and estimated
revenues for the ensuing fiscal year must be sufficient to meet all
outstanding fund encumbrances.
E. MINIMUM RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
In the event funds are not available to initially establish minimum required
balances, the Unreserved Unappropriated Fund Balance target shall be
achieved by adding a designated amount to the budget to cover the
deficiency over a period not to exceed five (5) fiscal years.
F. UTILIZATION OF MINIMUM RESERVES
Appropriation from the minimum Unreserved Unappropriated Fund
Balance shall require the approval of the Borough of Swissvale Council
and shall be only for one-time expenditures, such as capital purchases,
and not for ongoing expenditures unless a viable revenue plan designated
to sustain the expenditures is simultaneously adopted.
G. REPLENISHMENT OF MINIMUM RESERVE DEFICITS
If it is anticipated at the completion of any fiscal year that the projected or
estimated amount of Unreserved Unappropriated Fund Balance will be
less than the minimum requirement, the Borough Manager shall prepare
and submit in conjunction with the proposed budget a plan for the
expenditure or expense reductions and/or revenue increases necessary to
restore the minimum requirements in the subsequent budget year or other
appropriate period as required in the Minimum Reserve Requirements
section to Council.
H. UTILIZATION OF SURPLUS RESERVES
In the event that the Unreserved Unappropriated Fund Balance exceeds
the minimum requirements, the excess may be utilized for any lawful
purpose approved by the Borough of Swissvale Council. It is
recommended that the first priority be given to utilizing the excess within
the fund in which it was generated. In order to minimize the long term
effect of such use, the excess, shall be appropriated to fund one time
expenditures or expenses which do not result in recurring operating costs,
or other one-time costs including the establishment of or increase of the
legitimate reserve or designation of fund balance or reservation of retained
earnings in other funds.
I. ANNUAL REVIEW
Compliance with the provisions of this policy shall be reviewed as part of
the annual budget adoption process.
