ARTICLE I
Enforcement; General Penalty
[Adopted 8-7-2014 by Ord. No. 564]
§ 1-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Civil/Criminal Enforcement Ordinance
of the Borough of Kenhorst" and shall govern the imposition of fines and
penalties and the enforcement of ordinances within the Borough.
§ 1-2. Civil and criminal evidentiary requirements.
§ 1-3. Civil and criminal fines.
In all cases, all ordinances are amended to permit the highest fine amount
permitted by law in accordance with the Borough Code,1 as amended June
17, 2014, which provides:
A. Several ordinances in the Borough regulate behavior, property
maintenance, public safety, parking, solicitation, curfew, water, air,
noise pollution, zoning and other ordinances which entail enforcement,
while the Borough may not actually be in a position for an observable
offense. To ensure proper ordinance enforcement, the Borough shall be
permitted to file violations and prosecute the same based upon
observable conditions at a property or based upon information provided
by residents regarding violations. Said violation notice shall be valid
based upon observable conditions such as failure to remove snow, the
appearance of snow after plowing, the appearance of grass clippings in
the street, improper disposal of materials, accrual of improper
substances on a property, noise complaints, obtaining evidence of
solicitation and similar evidence.
B. The Borough shall be permitted to prosecute all manner of civil and/or
criminal violations based upon observed facts, learned facts or facts
which logic would dictate that a violation has occurred. The mere
existence of certain facts shall constitute appropriate probable cause to
bring a notice of violation that does not constitute a prison sentence.
C. In the context of the party who shall receive a violation, the violation
may be provided upon a person who is actually observed committing
the violation, companies or corporations who participated in the
violation or authorized the violation, property owners on which
property a violation occurred or any other person permitted by
individual ordinances who may be responsible for such violations.
D. In the event an ordinance provides for specific evidentiary
determinations that are not found in this article, those factors may also
be considered in conjunction with the information and circumstances
set forth in this article.

§ 1-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1-3

§ 1-4. Code enforcement officials.
The Police Department serving the Borough shall be empowered to enforce
any and all Borough ordinances as it deems proper. Moreover, from time
to time by resolution, the Borough Council may appoint code officers and
assistant code officers to enforce Borough ordinances as appropriate to
achieve compliance with the ordinances of the Borough.
§ 1-5. Enforcement notice.
After a Borough enforcement officer has made an initial determination of an
ordinance violation, he shall promptly serve notice of such violation to the
person(s) and/or entity responsible for the violation and further establish
the fine for such violation. A warning prior to an official enforcement notice
shall not constitute a waiver of any violation, nor shall it require warnings to
other similarly situated offenders. Where a penalty for such violation is not
paid within 30 days of such violation, the Borough enforcement official shall
initiate the appropriate enforcement proceedings. Similarly, if abatement
of the violation does not occur within the time set forth in the notice
of violation, the Code Official may initiate the appropriate enforcement
proceedings regardless of the passage of 30 days.
§ 1-6. Costs of violation.
In addition to any penalties/fines, the enforcement proceedings shall
include a demand for all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred
by the Borough.
§ 1-7. Failure to appeal.
All notices of violations shall state the manner of appeal. In the event that
a violator fails to appeal as set forth in the enforcement notice, it shall
be determined that the person did waive all defenses and the Magisterial
District Judge shall be limited to a determination of the amount of fines,
penalties and costs.
§ 1-8. Continuing fines.
For any person(s) and/or entity who is not in compliance with any Borough
ordinance, each continuing day of violation or noncompliance shall be a
separate offense for which the enforcement official may seek separate fines
and costs in the same or separate proceeding.
A. A civil penalty may not exceed $600 per violation; and
B. A criminal penalty may not exceed $1,000, and a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 30 days may be prescribed. [Amended 12-1-2016 by

imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood

ARTICLE III
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 241-16. Identification.
§ 241-17. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Borough of Kenhorst, classified as Special Flood
Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated July 3,
2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by Borough of Kenhorst and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by
more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
(a) Within any floodway area, encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall not be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
(2) The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have been provided in
the FIS but no floodway has been delineated.
§ 241-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 241-17
1:79
§ 241-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify
FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data.
§ 241-19. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Kenhorst Planning
Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.
§ 241-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other
federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is
nearest the construction site.
B. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.

future if the violation reoccurs.
(b) The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the report, and, if
the Code Enforcement Officer determines that adequate steps

plan is adequate to address future violations, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall, within 10 business days after

reject the remedial plan and issue written notice thereof to the
owner or agent. The owner or agent shall, on his or her
initiative, enforce the remedial plan. Failure to enforce the
remedial plan diligently shall be a violation of this article. If the

any way, the responsibility of the occupants, responsible parties
and/or their guests for their conduct or activity, nor shall it be
construed as an assignment, transfer or projection over or onto any
owner or agent of any responsibility of the occupants, any
responsible parties or their guests for their conduct or activity, nor
shall it be construed as an assignment, transfer or projection over
or onto any owner or agent of any responsibility or liability which
occupants or their guests may have as a result of their conduct or
activity under any private cause of action, civil or criminal
enforcement proceeding or criminal law; nor shall this section be
construed so as to require an owner or agent to indemnify or
defend the occupants, any responsible party or their guests when
any such action or proceeding is brought against the occupant
based upon the occupant's conduct or activity, nor to, in and of
itself, impose any liability for negligence based upon any act or
omission of the owner or agent. Nothing herein is intended to
impose any additional civil/criminal liability upon owner or agent
other than that which is imposed by other laws or judicial decisions

each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. In the
event that any regulated unit is occupied by more than the maximum
number of persons allowed by and listed on the rental permit issued in
accordance with § 362-3 of this article, then each day of occupancy by
each such person in excess of such maximum number of occupants shall
constitute a separate offense under this article. It shall be a violation of
this article to let a unit subject to regulation under this article after

with respect to a regulated unit for any of the reasons set forth in
Subsection D of this section:
(1) Nonrenewal. The denial of the privilege to apply for rental permit
renewal for a regulated unit after expiration of the permit term.
The owner shall be permitted to maintain occupants in the
regulated unit in question until the end of the current permit term,
but the Code Enforcement Officer shall not accept applications for
renewal of the rental permit until the expiration of the time set by
the Housing Appeals Board.

(2) Suspension. The immediate loss of the privilege to let the regulated
unit for a period of time set by the Code Enforcement Officer or the
Housing Appeals Board. The Code Enforcement Officer may
suspend only until the matter can be scheduled for the next
possible Housing Appeals Board meeting, at which meeting the
Housing Appeals Board shall consider the propriety of the
suspension and set the period of time for its duration, if it is to be
continued. The owner or agent, after the expiration of the
suspension period, may apply for rental permit renewal for the
regulated unit without the need to show cause why the owner or
agent's privilege to apply for a rental permit should be reinstated.
Upon suspension, the owner or agent shall take immediate steps to
evict the occupants of the regulated unit in question.
(3) Revocation. The immediate loss of the privilege to let the regulated
unit for a period of time set by the Code Enforcement Officer or the
Housing Appeals Board and the loss of the privilege to apply for
renewal of the rental permit at the expiration of said time period.
The Code Enforcement Officer may revoke only until the matter can
be scheduled for the next possible Housing Appeals Board meeting,
at which meeting the Housing Appeals Board shall consider the
propriety of the revocation and set the period of time for its
duration, if it is to be continued. Upon the loss of the privilege to
let, the owner or agent shall take immediate steps to evict the
occupants of the regulated unit in question.
D. Grounds for imposing discipline.
(1) Actions subject to discipline.
(a) Any of the following may subject an owner to discipline as
provided for in Subsection C:

or this article applicable to the premises within the time
directed by the Code Enforcement Officer.
[2] Refusal to permit the inspection of the premises by the
Code Enforcement Officer as required by this article.
[3] Failure to take such actions as may be required or
necessary to cause any open DCR to be deemed a closed
DCR by the Code Enforcement Officer by the end of the
permit year in which the DCR was issued, including, but
not limited to, failure to respond to notice of a DCR or
failure to perform an approved remedial plan in any

(b) For purposes of this subsection, there need be no criminal
conviction before a violation can be found to exist.
(2) No discipline involving nonrenewal, suspension and/or revocation
shall be permitted unless the discipline has been preceded by the

article and other ordinances of the Borough of Kenhorst or has

this regard, no closed DCR (and any enforcement actions
related thereto) shall be considered.
(d) Whether the owner has been subject to prior discipline under
this article. In this regard, no closed DCR (and any
enforcement actions related thereto) shall be considered. The
prior issuance of a formal warning in connection with the open
DCR shall be considered.
(e) The effect of disciplinary action on the occupants.
(f) The action taken by the owner or agent to remedy the violation
and to prevent future violations, including any approved
remedial plan submitted by the owner or agent in response to a
DCR with respect to any open DCR.
(g) The suitability of the policies and rental agreement or lease
terms employed by the owner or agent to manage the
regulated unit to enable the owner or agent to comply with the
provisions of this article.
(2) In addition to applying discipline as set forth in this section relating
to a DCR, the Code Enforcement Officer may recommend and the
Housing Appeals Board may impose upon the existing permit [or
subsequent permit(s) with respect to the performance codes]
reasonable conditions related to the regulated unit in question for
the purpose of fulfilling the goals of this article.

date upon which such suspension or revocation will
commence, and in the case of a suspension, the notice shall
also state the duration of the suspension.
(d) A statement that, due to the nonrenewal, suspension or
revocation (as the case may be) of the rental permit, the owner
or agent or any person acting on the owner's behalf is
prohibited from letting or permitting occupancy of the affected
regulated unit(s) from and during the period said disciplinary
action is in effect for, at minimum, one year.
(e) A statement informing the owner or agent of the owner's right
to appeal the decision to issue a formal warning or to subject
the rental permit in question to suspension, revocation or
nonrenewal to the rental permit Appeals Board, as provided in
this article.
(2) The procedures applicable to this section shall be the same as those
of § 362-9A of this article, excepting § 362-9A(1) and (2).
G. In addition to any other remedy, discipline or enforcement action
provided for in this article, the Borough may enforce this article by
pursuing a civil action, including an action in equity or other equitable
injunctive relief, including therewith:
(1) The decision by the Borough to pursue any such action shall not be
deemed an election of remedy so as to preclude other enforcement,
disciplinary or other remedies available to the Borough for
enforcement of this article; and
(2) In the Borough's pursuit of any such action, a prima facie showing
of a violation of any final, unappealable enforcement or disciplinary
action or final, unappealable Housing Appeals Board order shall be

§ 373-7. Measuring volume of industrial wastes; admission of
industrial wastes into sewer system.
A. Methods of measuring volume of industrial wastes.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a municipal
source shall discharge only industrial wastes into the sewer
system, the volume of water purchased shall be used as a measure
of the quantity of industrial wastes so discharged.
(2) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a municipal
source shall discharge combined domestic sewage and industrial
wastes into the sewer system, the volume of water purchased
chargeable as industrial wastes shall be the total volume of water
purchased, less the volume of water determined to be domestic
sewage. The volume of water determined to be domestic sewage
shall be determined, at the option of the Borough, in either of the
following ways:
(a) Actual measured flow; or
(b) By multiplying the average number of employees in the
establishment during the calendar quarter annum preceding
the time of billing by 2,250 gallons.
(3) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a municipal
source and discharging industrial wastes into the sewer system
also shall discharge unpolluted cooling water either to a separate
storm sewer or to some other outlet, an allowance in the nature of a
credit for the volume of water so otherwise discharged shall be
made in computing the sewer rentals or charges. The person so
discharging cooling water shall install a meter or meters, as
necessary, at his own expense, to measure accurately the volume of
water claimed as such credit in order to permit the Borough to
determine such allowance.
(4) Whenever a person using a private water supply shall discharge
industrial wastes into the sewer system, such person shall install,
at his own expense, either a water meter or meters on the source or
sources of supply, as may be required to measure the total volume
of water used, which total volume of water used shall be subject to
adjustment as provided in Subsections A(2) and (3) of this section,
or a sewer meter or meters to measure the entire volume of
domestic sewage and/or industrial wastes discharged into the
sewer system, which volume shall be subject to adjustment as
provided in Subsection A(2) of this section.
B. Measurement of concentration of industrial wastes.
(1) Either the Borough or the owner of any room, group of rooms or
enclosure constituting an industrial establishment from which
industrial wastes are discharged may request the collection and

§ 373-8. Prohibited wastes.
analysis of samples of industrial wastes for use as a basis of
determining additional sewer rentals or charges as provided in
Subsection B of § 373-3 of this article. Such collection and analysis
shall be made by a competent registered engineer acceptable to
and approved by the Borough. Costs of such collection and analysis
shall be paid by the party requesting the same.
(2) The analysis of samples obtained shall be made in accordance with
the latest edition of the "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Sewage," as published by the American Public Health
Association.

group of rooms or enclosure constituting an industrial establishment
from which industrial wastes are discharged into the sewer system shall
install a suitable control manhole in the sewer service line serving such
industrial establishment in order to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of such industrial wastes. Such manhole, when required,
shall be accessible, shall be so located and shall be constructed in
accordance with plans approved by the Borough. The manhole shall be
installed by such owner, at his own expense, and shall be maintained by
such owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
D. Changes in type of industrial wastes. If the owner of any room, group of
rooms or enclosure constituting an industrial establishment from which
industrial wastes are discharged into the sewer system shall propose to
change methods of operation so as to alter the type of industrial wastes
then being discharged into the sewer system, such owner shall notify
the Borough, in writing, at least 10 days prior to such change, so that
the Borough may sample the industrial wastes immediately after such
change takes place in order to make the determinations provided for or
required by this article.
E. Exclusion from the sewer system of certain water. Exclusion from the
sewer system of non-contaminated wastewaters and waters used solely
for cooling purposes may be required by the Borough or such exclusion
may be optional on the part of any person if not required by the
Borough.
F. Reservation of rights by Borough. No provision of this article shall be
construed as preventing any special arrangement or agreement
between the Borough and any person whereby industrial wastes of
unusual strength or character may be accepted into the sewer system,
subject to equitable payment in connection therewith by the person
concerned.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into any sewer any

General Provisions
§ 398-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Schuylkill River
Watershed Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 398-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment and
activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public
health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the
municipality and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources,
and the environment.
D. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface
and groundwater quality.
E. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
F. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream base flow and aquatic
ecosystems. The most cost-effective and environmentally advantageous
way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project
design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoiding sensitive
§ 398-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-2
1:225
§ 398-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Schuylkill River Watershed by maintaining the natural
hydrologic regime by minimizing the impacts described in § 398-2 through
provisions designed to:
areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and designing to
topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
G. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
H. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
I. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
A. Promote alternative project designs and layout that minimizes impacts
to surface and groundwater.
B. Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
C. Minimize increases in stormwater volume.
D. Minimize impervious surfaces.
E. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
F. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
G. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
I. Focus on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
J. Maintain existing base flows and quality of streams and watercourses,
where possible.
K. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code § 93.4a to protect and maintain "existing
uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all

Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained under state
regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
of whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect
the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway, to
prevent these impacts.

§ 398-10 KENHORST CODE § 398-11
1:248
§ 398-12. Nonstructural project design (sequencing to minimize
stormwater impacts).
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from

1:249
§ 398-13. Groundwater recharge (infiltration/recharge/
bioretention).
Maximizing the groundwater recharge capacity of the area being developed
is required. Design of the infiltration stormwater management facilities
shall give consideration to providing groundwater recharge to compensate
for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface
is disturbed or impervious surface is created. It is recommended that roof
runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs which can be over-designed to
compensate for the infiltration losses due to parking areas. It is
recommended that roof runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs which may
be designed to compensate for the runoff from parking areas. These
measures are required to be consistent with § 398-3, and take advantage
of utilizing any existing recharge areas. Infiltration may not be feasible on
every site due to site-specific limitations such as soil type. If it cannot be
physically accomplished due to seasonal high water table, soil permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances from special geologic features, then
the design professional shall be responsible to show that this cannot be
physically accomplished. If it can be physically accomplished, then the
(a) Minimize earth disturbance.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(c) Break up large impervious surfaces.
(6) Satisfy infiltration objective (§ 398-13) and provide for stormwater
pretreatment prior to infiltration. Pretreatment may not be
necessary for rooftop runoff which enters the infiltration facility
directly from a roof leader.
(7) Satisfy water quality (§ 398-14) and stream bank erosion protection
objective (§ 398-15).
(8) Determine what management district the site falls into (Appendix
D)134 and conduct an existing conditions runoff analysis.
(9) Prepare final project design to maintain existing conditions
drainage areas and discharge points, to minimize earth disturbance
and impervious surfaces, and to the maximum extent possible, to
ensure the remaining site development has no surface or point
discharge.
(10) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final
design and to meet the release rate and in turn the overbank flow
and extreme event requirements (§ 398-16).
(11) Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to
discharge, as part of detention, bioretention, direct discharge or
other structural control.

(b) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the
additional stormwater load and drain completely as
determined by field tests conducted by the applicant's design
professional.
(c) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely
infiltrating the required retention (infiltration) volume within
four days (96 hours).
(d) Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(3) The size of the infiltration facility shall be based upon the following
volume criteria:
(a) NRCS Curve Number equation.
[1] The NRCS runoff equation shall be utilized to calculate
infiltration requirements (I) in inches.
Equation 398-13.1
I (Infiltration requirement, in inches) = (200/CN) - 2
Where:
CN = SCS (NRCS) curve number of existing
conditions contributing to the infiltration
facility
[2] This equation is displayed graphically in, and the
infiltration requirement can be determined from Figure
398-13.1.
§ 398-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-13
1:251
Figure 398-13.1. Infiltration requirement based
upon NRCS Curve Number
[3] The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) required to meet
the infiltration requirement would therefore be computed
as:
Equation 305.2
Rev = I * impervious area (square feet)/(12 in/ft) = cubic
feet
Where:
I = infiltration requirements (in inches)
(b) Annual recharge water budget approach.
[1] It has been determined that infiltrating 0.46 inches of
runoff from the impervious areas will aid in maintaining
the hydrologic regime of the watershed. If the goals of
§ 398-13A(3)(a) cannot be achieved, then 0.46 inches of
rainfall shall be infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to
an existing site conditions curve number of 81. Above a
curve number of 81, Equation 398-13.1 or the curve in
§ 398-13 KENHORST CODE § 398-13
1:252
Figure 398-13.1 should be used to determine the
infiltration requirement.
[2] The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) required again
would therefore be computed as:
Rev = (0.46 or I, whichever is less) * impervious area
(sq.ft.)/(12in/ft) = cubic feet
B. Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required
where practicable to determine the suitability of infiltration facilities.
The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified design professional,
and at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock and
subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration
BMP shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration is not permitted to be ruled out
without conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface)
to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev)
volume based on field determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface.
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the municipality
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
C. Carbonate areas. The applicant is required to investigate the ability of
all areas on the site which are not underlain by carbonate rock to meet
the infiltration requirements of § 398-13A. If this investigation proves
infeasible, infiltration can occur on areas underlain by carbonate rock
by following the recommended procedure below in conjunction with
Figure B-4 in Appendix B.135 However, the applicant is not required to
use infiltration in carbonate areas even if the site falls into the
"Recommended" range on Figure B-4 in Appendix B. If infiltration is not
proposed, the calculated infiltration volume (§ 398-13A) shall be treated
by an acceptable BMP.
(1) Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in Figure B-4 in
Appendix B shall be calculated as follows:
135. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 398-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-13
1:253
(2) The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
Area Description Weighting
All disturbed area to be made
impervious
100%
All disturbed areas to be made pervious 50%
All undisturbed impervious areas 100%
All undisturbed pervious areas 0%
(3) Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration BMP. The effective soil thickness in Figure B-4 in
Appendix B136 is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability, as follows:
Permeability Range Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
(4) No infiltration structure in non-carbonate areas shall be within 50
feet of a boundary with carbonate rock, except when a preliminary
site investigation has been done showing the absence of special
geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
D. Stormwater hotspots. Following is a list of examples of designated
hotspots. If a municipality designates a site or use as a hotspot, it has
important implications for how stormwater is managed. First and
foremost, untreated stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be
allowed to recharge into groundwater where it may contaminate water
supplies. Therefore, the Rev requirement shall not applied to
development sites that fit into the hotspot category (the entire WQv
must still be treated). Second, a greater level of stormwater treatment
shall be considered at hotspot sites to prevent pollutant washoff after
construction. EPA's NPDES stormwater program requires some
industrial sites to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution
prevention plan.
(1) Examples of hotspots:
136. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 398-13 KENHORST CODE § 398-13
1:254
(a) Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities.
(b) Vehicle fueling stations.
(c) Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
(d) Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
(e) Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
(f) Industrial sites (based on Standard Industrial Codes).
(g) Marinas (service and maintenance).
(h) Outdoor liquid container storage.
(i) Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
(j) Public works storage areas.
(k) Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(l) Commercial container nursery.
(m) Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate
review authority.
(2) The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
(a) Residential streets and rural highways.
(b) Residential development.
(c) Institutional development.
(d) Office developments.
(e) Nonindustrial rooftops.
(f) Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries [which may
need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
(3) While large highways [average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater
than 30,000] are not designated as a stormwater hotspot; however,
it is important to ensure that highway stormwater management
plans adequately protect groundwater.
E. Where infiltration is proposed in source water protection areas as
defined by the local municipality or water authority, the applicant shall
work with the appropriate entity to ensure protection of the water
supply.
F. Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative
or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities, and nonstructural
stormwater management alternatives.
§ 398-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-13
1:255
§ 398-14. Water quality requirements.
The applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements
of this article. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the
municipality shall commence until approval by the municipality of a plan
which demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
postconstruction is complete.
G. Where salt or chloride (salt storage) would be a pollutant, since soils do
little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater, a
qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of
groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and
perform a hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
H. The infiltration requirement in high quality or exceptional value waters
shall be subject to the Department's Chapter 93 Antidegradation
Regulations.
I. An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A hydrogeologic study
may be required by the municipality.
J. The municipality may, upon its sole discretion, require the applicant to
provide safeguards against groundwater contamination for land uses
that may cause groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or
spill.
K. Unless otherwise specified in Chapter 475, Zoning, the following
setbacks for infiltration facilities shall apply:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Ten feet downslope or 100 feet upslope from building foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock, unless a
preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock to
show the absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the
proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation is
provided to show all setbacks from wells, foundations and
drainfields on the neighboring property will be met.
A. The BMPs shall be designed, implemented and maintained to meet state
water quality requirements, and any other more stringent requirements
as determined by the municipality.
B. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
§ 398-13 KENHORST CODE § 398-14
1:256
§ 398-15. Stream bank erosion requirements.
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration. Replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment. Use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff; and
(3) Stream bank and streambed protection. Management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
C. For areas within defined special protection subwatersheds which
include exceptional value (EV) and high quality (HQ) waters, the
temperature and quality of water and streams shall be maintained
through the use of temperature-sensitive BMPs and stormwater
conveyance systems.
D. To accomplish the above, the applicant shall submit original and
innovative designs to the Municipal Engineer for review and approval.
Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives through a
combination of BMPs (best management practices).
E. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a stream buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet
to either side of the top of bank of the channel. The buffer area shall be
maintained with and encouraged to use appropriate native vegetation
(reference to Appendix H of Pennsylvania Handbook of Best
Management Practices for Developing Area for plant lists). If the
applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50 feet, the buffer
width may be reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If
an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement,
etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the existing buffer
shall be maintained. [The municipality may select a smaller or larger
buffer width if desired, but the selected buffer may not be less than 10
feet.] This does not include lakes or wetlands.
F. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the municipality. The issuance of an NPDES Construction Permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide General Permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of Subsection A of this section.
A. In addition to control of the water quality volume, in order to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion,
§ 398-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-15
1:257
§ 398-16. Stormwater management districts.
the primary requirement is to design a BMP to detain the proposed
conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm to the existing
conditions one-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution.
Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at
the bottom of the outlet structure) so that the proposed conditions oneyear
storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from
a point where the maximum volume of water from the one-year storm is
captured. (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).
B. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be a
three-inch diameter orifice and a trash rack shall be installed to prevent
clogging. On sites with small contributing drainage areas to this BMP
that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four-hour
attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the calculations shall be
submitted showing this condition. Orifice sizes less than three inches
can be utilized provided that the design will prevent clogging of the
intake.
C. In "no detention" areas (District C) only (see § 398-16), the objective is
not to attenuate the storms greater than the two-year recurrence
interval. This can be accomplished by configuring the outlet structure
not to control the larger storms, or by a bypass channel that diverts only
the two-year stormwater runoff into the basin, or conversely, diverts
flows in excess of the two-year storm away from the basin.
A. The Schuylkill River Watershed has been divided into stormwater
management districts as shown on the Management District Map in
Appendix D.137
(1) In addition to the quantity requirements specified on the Map, the
groundwater recharge (§ 398-13), water quality (§ 398-14), and
stream bank erosion control (§ 398-15), requirements shall be
implemented.
(2) Development sites located in each of the districts must control
proposed conditions runoff rates to existing conditions runoff rates
for the design storms in accordance with the table located on the
Map.
(3) For any site which proposes direct discharge, the site may only
utilize any available capacity in the downstream conveyance
system which is equivalent to the ratio of the proposed
development site acreage to the total watershed acreage to the
downstream conveyance system. Therefore, if the proposed
development site is 10% of the total watershed area, the increase in
137. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 398-15 KENHORST CODE § 398-16
1:258
runoff may only use up 10% of the documented available
downstream, capacity at peak flow.
B. General. Proposed condition rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management District
Watershed Map (Appendix D138) and in this section.
C. District boundaries. The boundaries of the Stormwater Management
Districts are shown on an Official Map that is available for inspection at
the municipal office. A copy of the Official Map at a reduced scale is
included in the Appendix D.139 The exact location of the Stormwater
Management District boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part
of the drainage plan.
D. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the
Management District Criteria for which the discharge is located, as
indicated in this section. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the discharge site. In this
case, peak discharge in any direction shall follow Management District
A criteria provided that the overall site discharge meets the
Management District Criteria for which the discharge is located.
E. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed
to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
F. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the Management District Criteria. In other words,
unimpacted areas bypassing the stormwater management facilities
would not be subject to the Management District Criteria.
G. "No harm" option. For any proposed development site not located in a
provisional direct discharge district, the applicant has the option of
using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the
applicant can prove that "no harm" would be caused by discharging at a
higher runoff rate than that specified by the stormwater management
plan. The "no harm" option is used when an applicant can prove that the
proposed condition hydrographs can match existing conditions
138. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included as an attachment to this chapter.
139. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 398-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-16
1:259
hydrographs, or if it can be proved that the proposed conditions will
not cause increases in peaks at all points downstream. Proof of "no
harm" must be shown based upon the following downstream impact
evaluation, which shall include a downstream hydraulic capacity
analysis consistent with § 398-16H to determine if adequate hydraulic
capacity exists. The applicant shall submit to the municipality this
evaluation of the impacts due to increased downstream stormwater
flows in the watershed.
(1) The hydrologic regime of the site must be maintained.
(2) The downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of
hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development
upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted stream
flow or any stream channel section, established with the
concurrence of the municipality.
(3) The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow
diminishes due to additional flow from tributaries and/or stream
attenuation.
(4) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-,
and one-hundred-year) shall be the values from the calibrated
model for the Schuylkill River Watershed. These flow values can be
obtained from the original Act 167 watershed stormwater
management plans.
(5) Applicant-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove "no
harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with § 398-16H.
(6) A financial distress shall not constitute grounds for the municipality
to approve the use of the "no-harm" option.
(7) Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to
implement the "no-harm" option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
(8) Any "no-harm" justifications shall be submitted by the applicant as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV.
H. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
§ 398-16 KENHORST CODE § 398-16
1:260
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating
any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
I. Hardship option.
(1) The municipality may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged
that the provisions of this (Act 167) ordinance inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing
and accompanied by the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule
adopted by the municipality. A copy of the waiver request shall be
provided to each of the following: municipality, municipal engineer,
municipal solicitor and Berks County Planning Commission. The
request shall fully document the nature of the alleged hardship.
(2) The municipality may grant a waiver, provided that all of the
following findings are made in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due
to such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
Stormwater Management District in which the property is
located;
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter, including
the "no harm" provisions, and that the authorization of a
waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property;140
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;

II).
§ 398-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-16
1:261
§ 398-17. Calculation methodology.
(d) That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum
waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue; and
(e) That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a
hardship waiver.
(3) In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of Act 167 and this chapter. If a hardship waiver is
granted, the applicant must still manage the quantity, velocity,
direction and quality of resulting storm runoff as is necessary to
prevent injury to health, safety or other property.
(a) For regulated activities in § 398-5D(1) and (2), the municipal
governing body shall hear requests for and decide on hardship
waiver requests on behalf of the municipality.
(b) For regulated activities in § 398-5D(4), (5), (6), (7) and (8), the
Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for and decide on
hardship waiver requests on behalf of the municipality.
(c) The municipality shall not waive the water quality provisions of
this chapter.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex
Method. Table 398-17.1 summarizes acceptable computation methods
and the method selected by the design professional shall be based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. The municipality may allow the use of the Rational Method to
estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than
200 acres. The Soil Complex Method shall be used for drainage areas
greater than 200 acres.

various return period storms according to the region in which they are
located as presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B of this chapter.141 If a
hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used
for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be

Department of Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figures
B-2 to B-4). Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated
using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to

coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in Appendix B of this
chapter.
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph (i.e., TR-20, TR-55, HEC-1,
PSRM). The municipality may approve the use of any generally
accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total
runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that
produces a full hydrograph.
A. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
B. Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.

§ 398-19. NPDES requirements.
Federal regulations approved October 1999 require operators of small
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) to obtain NPDES Phase II
permits from DEP by March 2003. (NPDES II is an acronym for the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Phase II Stormwater Permitting
Regulations.) This program affects all municipalities in "urbanized areas"
of the state. This definition applies to all Schuylkill River watershed
municipalities identified in Table III-1 of the Schuylkill River Stormwater
Management Plan Volume II as NPDES Phase II municipalities. Therefore,
these identified municipalities will be subject to the NPDES Phase II
requirements mandated by the Federal Clean Water Act144 as administered
by DEP. For more information on NPDES II requirements, contact the DEP
Regional Office.
C. All wet basin designs shall incorporate biologic controls consistent with
the West Nile Guidance found in Appendix F.143
D. Any other drainage conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter
105 regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage
structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
with a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point
along the top of the roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as
defined in PaDEP Chapter 105 regulations may require a permit under
dam safety regulations. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-ofway
must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit
submission requirements.
E. The design of any proposed roadway drainage facilities shall be
consistent with the PennDOT Design Manual Part 2, Publication 13M.
F. Storm sewers must be able to convey proposed conditions runoff from a

part. The findings and reasons upon which the Council's action is
based shall be given in writing to the individuals and groups listed
in § 410-11F(1) and stated in the minutes of the meeting at which
the Council reviews the plan. When the plan as submitted is not
approved, the report shall specify the requirements of this chapter

(4) The approval of a preliminary plan does not authorize the recording
of the subdivision plan nor the sale or transfer of lots.

changed. The subdivider should note that a final plan not
submitted within one year of the date of approval of a
preliminary plan, or within an extended period of time if such
an extension is granted by the Borough Council, may be
considered a new preliminary plan.
A. Submission. Within 12 months after approval of the preliminary plan, a
final plan with all necessary supplementary data shall be submitted to
the Borough Secretary. An extension of time may be granted by the
Borough Council upon written request, provided that the extension of

Borough Council in their approval of the preliminary plan. Failure to
comply with past reviews shall constitute grounds for the Planning

may accept a final plan modified to reflect any substantial changes on
the site of the proposed subdivision or in its surroundings which
occurred after the preliminary plan review. If substantial changes on

F. Review of final plan. When a final plan has been officially accepted for
review by the Borough, it may be reviewed by the Planning Commission
at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided that if the County
Planning Commission has been asked to review the final plan, the
written report of the County Planning Commission regarding the plan in
question has been received prior to that regularly scheduled meeting
and that the Borough Planning Commission determines that it will be
able to adequately study the final plan before the regularly scheduled
meeting.
(1) If the Borough Planning Commission has requested and not
received such a written report from the County Planning
Commission, the Borough Planning Commission may decline to
review the plan at its regularly scheduled meeting and review the
plan at a special meeting or at another regularly scheduled
meeting.
(2) At the meeting at which the final plan is reviewed, the Borough
Planning Commission shall review the plan to determine its
conformance with the requirements of this chapter. At this
meeting, written reports regarding the subdivision in question from
the Borough Zoning Officer and the Borough Engineer shall be
reviewed. If any reports regarding the subdivision in question from
the County Planning Commission or other county or state agencies
have been received prior to the meeting, these reports shall also be
reviewed at the meeting.
(3) If the County Planning Commission has been asked to review a final
plan, no official action should be taken by the Borough Planning
Commission with respect to a final plan until the Commission has
received a written report regarding the plan in question from the
County Planning Commission and, where applicable, the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, provided such reports
are received within 30 days after the County Planning Commission
received a request to review the final plan.

may review the final plan and any written reports regarding the
plan from the Borough Planning Commission, the County Planning

and where applicable, the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation or any other reports which may be required.
(2) If the County Planning Commission has been asked to review a final
plan, no official action shall be taken by the Borough Council with
respect to a final plan until the Borough has received the written
report of the County Planning Commission and, where applicable,
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, provided that such
reports are received within 30 days after the County Planning
Commission received a request to review the final plan. Failure of
the County Planning Commission to act within 30 days shall
constitute approval of the plan as submitted and the Borough
Council may officially act on the basis of such approval.
(3) Before acting on a final plan, the Council may arrange for a public
hearing on the plan, giving public notice as defined in Act 247 of
1968, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended.172

findings and reasons upon which the Council's action is based shall
be given in writing to the persons listed under § 410-12G(4) and
also stated in the minutes of the Borough Council. Any
modifications in the plan required as prerequisites to approval of
the final plan shall be stated.

§ 410-13. Performance guarantees; recording of final plan.
(6) The Borough Council shall, within 90 days after the date the
Borough accepts a final plan for review, notify the subdivider or his
agent of the action taken by the Council.
(7) A plan which has been preliminarily approved shall not be recorded
until the requirements of § 410-13, Performance guarantees;
recording of final plan, have been met.
A. Within 30 days after a final plan has received preliminary approval and
before a plan may be recorded and before the issuance of any building
permits, the subdivider shall deliver to the Borough Council a
performance guarantee in the form of a corporate bond or other
acceptable security in an amount of 110% of the cost of all
improvements required by this chapter and Chapter 475, Zoning, and
the approved improvement plans and as estimated by the Borough
Engineer. The performance guarantee shall guarantee the construction
and installation, within one year from the deliverance of the guarantee,
of those improvements to be located within that portion of the final plan
which has been approved by the Borough Council. Upon written
application, the Council may, at its discretion, extend the one-year
period by not more than two additional years by formal resolution.173
B. After a final plan has received preliminary approval, improvements
required by this chapter and indicated as being provided by the
subdivider may be installed. Upon written application, the Council may
by formal resolution reduce the amount of the performance guarantee
when the improvements have been completed in part and the
completed improvements have been approved by the Borough. If the
performance guarantee is reduced, it shall be reduced by the amount
which was expended for the completed improvements.
(1) Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event of
default under a performance guarantee, the Borough may enforce
any security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The
proceeds of the performance guarantee received by the Borough
may be used to construct and install the improvements. If the cost
of the improvements exceeds the amount of the performance
guarantee, the subdivider shall be liable for the amount in excess of
the amount which the Borough has expended for such
improvements. In the case that the amount of the performance
guarantee exceeds the actual cost of improvements made, the

developer shall notify the Borough, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements
and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Borough Engineer shall inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall thereupon
file a report, in writing, with the Borough Council, and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. Said report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not
be approved or shall be rejected by the Borough Engineer, said
report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection. The Borough Council shall notify the developer in writing
within the time allotted by the Municipalities Planning Code by
certified or registered mail of its action. If any portion of the
said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by
the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as
outlined herein, shall be followed.
C. Within 30 days after preliminary approval of the final plan by the
Council and before the issuance of any building permit, the subdivider
shall deliver to the Borough Council Secretary a maintenance
guarantee in an amount not less than 10% of the Borough Engineer's
estimate of the cost of all improvements required by this chapter. The
guarantee shall guarantee that the subdivider shall maintain all such
improvements in good condition for a period of 18 months after
completion of construction and installation of all such improvements. If
the maintenance guarantee is not so delivered, the preliminary
approval of the final plan shall expire 30 days after the date of that
approval.
D. After preliminary favorable action by the Borough Council and the
Borough Planning Commission and after the completion of the
procedures required by these regulations the Council and the Planning
Commission shall place their endorsements on the record plan and on
as many other copies of the final plan as may be desired. The record
plan of the subdivision which has secured final approval shall be signed
by the President of the Borough Council and the Borough Seal shall be
affixed to the plan. No subdivision plan may be legally recorded unless
it bears Borough approval indicated by the signature of the President of
the Borough Council and the Borough Seal.
E. The Record Plan shall be a clear and legible plan prepared in
accordance with the Recorder of Deeds standards.
F. No subdivision plan may legally be recorded unless it has been
endorsed by the County Planning Commission and bears the County
Planning Commission stamp "Reviewed." Such endorsement shall be
indicated on the record plan. As a prerequisite for endorsement, the
County Planning Commission will require a minimum of two paper

1:338
§ 410-14. Plans exempted from standard procedures.
prints bearing the Borough Seal and the endorsement by the Borough
Planning Commission and the Borough Council. The County Planning
Commission will accept additional prints if they are submitted for our
"Reviewed" stamp. In addition, the County Planning Commission
requires a letter from PennDOT indicating approval of the intersection
as proposed prior to plan endorsement and the developer will also
be required to obtain a letter from the appropriate utility company
indicating that it has received final plans for the design of an
underground electric system. After the plan has been given final
approval by the Borough, the plan shall be submitted to the County
Planning Commission for endorsement.
G. The subdivider shall file the record plan with the County Recorder of
Deeds within 90 days of the date of the meeting at which Borough
Council gave approval to the final plan. If the subdivider fails to record
the final plan within such period, the action of the Borough shall be null
and void. The subdivider shall provide the Borough with satisfactory
evidence that he has filed the record plan with the County Recorder of
Deeds prior to issuance of any zoning or building permits.
H. The Borough shall receive one reproducible plan on Mylar of the final
plan as approved.
I. All streets, parks, or other improvements shown on the subdivision plan
shall be deemed to be private until such time as the same have been
offered for dedication to the Borough and accepted by resolution of the
Borough Council. If any improvement is to be dedicated to the Borough,
such offer of dedication shall be submitted to the Borough for
acceptance prior to the recording of the final plan. The acceptance of
any improvement shall be by a separate action of the Borough Council.
A. Auction sale. In the case of the proposed subdivision of land by process
of auction sale, the following procedure may be used by the subdivider:
(1) The subdivider shall prepare and submit a preliminary plan in
accordance with these regulations.
(2) The preliminary plan shall comply with the requirements of
§ 410-16 of this chapter and in addition contain the following
notation:
"This property is intended to be sold by auction on or about
__________, 20_____, in whole or in part, according to this plan.
Sale of lots at such auction shall be in the form of agreement
to purchase, and no actual transfer of ownership or interest in
such lots shall proceed until a final plan showing such division
of property shall have been approved by the Borough Council, in
accordance with its regulations, and recorded in the office of the
County Recorder of Deeds."
§ 410-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-14
1:339
(3) The auction sale may then proceed in accordance with the above
notation, after which the subdivider shall prepare and submit a
final plan in accordance with these regulations.
B. Minor subdivisions. Where the intent of the subdivider so expressed in
writing is to create no more than two parcels, lots, or tracts of land from
the original tract and the land fronts on an existing improved Borough
or state road, the Borough Planning Commission may require the
subdivider to prepare a sketch plan for record. This plan shall show the
simple subdivision accompanied by the required data outlined in
§ 410-15 of this chapter. Further subdivisions from a tract recorded
under this section will require a review of plans in accordance with the
standard procedures of this chapter.
C. Resubdivision. Any replating or resubdivision of land, including
changes to recorded plans, shall be considered a subdivision, and shall
comply with these regulations, except that:
(1) Lot lines may be changed from those shown on a recorded plan,
provided that in making such changes:
(a) No lot or tract of land shall be created or sold that is smaller
than the minimum dimensions required by Chapter 475,
Zoning;
(b) Easements or rights-of-way reserved for drainage shall not be
changed;
(c) Street locations and block sizes shall not be changed;
(d) No lot shall be created which does not abut a street; and
(e) The character of the area shall be maintained, keeping lot sizes
and land uses, dimensions and proportions relatively close to
those of contiguous developments.
(2) In every case wherein lot lines are changed as permitted above, at
the completion of each section, the subdivider shall:
(a) Submit to the Borough and County Planning Commissions
copies of the final plan revised to show such changes. After this
submission, the Borough Planning Commission will, in writing,
advise the subdivider and the Borough Secretary if the revised
plan complies with § 410-14C(1).
(b) When the plan does comply with § 410-14C(1), the subdivider
shall submit the record plan to the Borough for the
endorsements of the Borough Planning Commission and the
Borough Council. The subdivider shall also submit the record
plan to the County Planning Commission for its endorsement
(which shall specifically identify the previous record plan thus
superseded) and then record the plan if endorsement is
secured.
§ 410-14 KENHORST CODE § 410-14
1:340
(c) The record plan shall be a clear and legible black-on-white
print on paper.

regulations shall prevail; otherwise, the standards and requirements of
these regulations shall apply.
C. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified
by the Borough Planning Commission if, in the judgment of the Borough
Planning Commission, the proposed plan achieves substantially the
objectives of these regulations and is further protected by such
covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and
achievement of the subdivision plan.
D. Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property, such as may arise
from fire, floods, disease, or other causes, shall not be subdivided for
building purposes unless such hazards have been eliminated or unless
the subdivision plan shall show adequate safeguards against them,
which shall be approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
E. Subdivision plans shall give due recognition to the official plan of the
Borough or to parts of the official plans which have been adopted
pursuant to statute.
F. Land proposed for subdivision shall not be developed or changed by
grading, excavating, or by the removal or destruction of the natural
topsoil, trees, or other vegetative cover unless adequate provisions for
minimizing erosion and sediment are provided under Title 25, Chapter
102, Rules and Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection,179 and § 410-25E of these regulations.

traffic, but the subdivider shall give adequate consideration to
provision for the extension and continuation of major and collector
streets into and from adjoining properties.
(5) Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of improper width or
alignment, the Borough Planning Commission may require the
dedication of land sufficient to widen the street or correct the
alignment.

of filing a preliminary plan in the case of a major subdivision and prior
to the recording of a minor subdivision plan.
B. The schedule of fees shall be obtainable in the office of the Borough
Secretary, and shall be posted therein and in such other places as the
Borough Council may designate.
C. No final plan shall be approved unless and until all fees and charges
have been paid in full.
A. The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for
the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. The Borough
Council may modify or extend said provisions conditionally in individual
cases as may be deemed necessary in the public interest; provided,
however, that such variation shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter. If the literal compliance with any
mandatory provisions of these regulations is shown by a subdivider, to a
majority of the Borough Council present at a prescheduled public
meeting, to be unreasonable and to cause undue hardship as they apply
to his property to be subdivided, the Borough Council may grant a
variance to the subdivider from such mandatory provisions if the
variance will promote the public interest.
B. No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made in any
plan of a subdivision after approval has been made by the Council and
endorsed on the plan, unless said plan is first resubmitted to and
approved by the Borough Council.
C. Challenges. Any person desiring to challenge the validity of any
provision of this chapter or any amendment thereof shall make such
challenge in accordance with the provisions of Act 247 of 1968, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.184
A. No lot in a subdivision shall be sold, no permit to erect any building
upon land in a subdivision shall be issued, and no buildings shall be

been approved and properly recorded and until improvements have
been either constructed or guaranteed.

a record of their findings, decisions, and recommendations relative to all
subdivision plans filed for review. Such records shall be made available to
the public for review.
B. Any person, copartnership or corporation who shall subdivide any lot,
tract, or parcel of land; layout, construct, open or dedicate any street,
sanitary sewer, storm sewer or water main for public use or travel or for
the common use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon; sell any lot;
or erect any building in a subdivision without first having complied with
all of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a violation of this
chapter.185
C. Upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Borough, such persons or the members of such
copartnership or the officers of such corporation responsible for such
violation shall pay a judgment of not more than $500, plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant
to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial
District Judge, determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge, and
thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.186

E. Nothing herein shall prevent the Borough from taking such other action
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

1:408
§ 419-18. Levy and collection of taxes.
Tax collection sources shall be limited to earned income and net profits.
§ 419-19. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to him by the Borough Manager or the Receiver
of Taxes. It is further provided that if the employer fails to file said return
and pay the tax, whether or not he makes collection thereof from the salary,
wages, or commission paid by him to the persons engaged by him in an
occupation within the Borough, the employer shall be responsible for the
payment of the tax in full and as though the tax had originally be levied
against him.
§ 419-20. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
Beginning on January 1, 2012, and continuing each year thereafter, each
employer shall deduct the pro rata share on a payroll basis for each payroll
period in which the employee is engaged in an occupation, except as set
forth below. Tax deducted shall be paid over to the Borough quarterly,
within 30 days after the end of the quarter.
§ 419-21. Income exemption.
Individuals who earn less than $12,000 per year shall be exempt from the
payment of said LST. In order to obtain said exemption at the beginning of
the tax year, individuals who claim that they shall make less than $12,000
shall complete a low income exemption certificate.
§ 419-22. Military exemption.
All individuals who are on active military duty or have been called to active
military duty at any time within the taxing year shall be exempt from the
payment of the LST. This shall include any former and/or current member
of the military who is a paraplegic, double and/or quadruple amputee or

Proof of the same shall be submitted to the taxing authority to achieve said

Community and Economic Development, they shall be exempted from
the collection from the employee. In the event that the employee who

that time shall collect said LST.
B. The employee claiming the exemption must attach a copy of the prior
year's final pay stub or copy of a prior year's W-2 to the exemption when
it is submitted to the employer. The employee must file his income
exemption certificate with both the taxing body and the employer.
§ 419-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 419-23
1:409
§ 419-23. Restoration of withholding.
§ 419-24. Employer pay periods.
A. Employers must "restart" withholding the LST from an employee who
files an exemption certificate in the following circumstances:
(1) If instructed to do so by the municipality levying the tax;
(2) If notified by the employee that they are no longer eligible for the
exemption;
(3) If the employer pays the employee more than $12,000 for the
calendar year.
B. Employers must "restart" withholding of the LST by withholding: a
"catch-up" lump sum tax equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the employee as a result of the exemption; and the same
amount per payroll period that is withheld from other employees.
Except for monitoring when an employee who has filed an income
exemption certificate earns more than $12,000, the intent of this
amendment is that employers are not responsible for investigating
exemptions, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting an
employee from the tax.
A. Assessment and collection. Since the tax set forth herein totals $52, the
tax will be assessed and collected on a pro rata basis determined by the
number of payroll periods established by an employer for the calendar
year. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on each taxpayer for a
payroll period is calculated by dividing the combined rate of the LST by
the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the
calendar year. When calculating the pro rata share, employers are
required to round down to the nearest $100. For instance, a $52 tax
would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly, or at $4.33
per month for taxpayers paid monthly.
B. Remittance. Employers must remit withheld taxes to the designated Tax
Collector 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The municipal
and school taxes must be withheld together and remitted to the
municipality or the Tax Collector, who are required to distribute the
school's share of the tax to the school district.
C. Self-employed individuals. The tax shall be prorated and paid by selfemployed
individuals on a quarterly basis, as if the payroll period is a
calendar quarter. Self-employed taxpayers shall pay the tax to the
municipality or the Tax Collector 30 days after the end of each calendar
quarter.
D. Penalties. Failure to follow the above payment provisions shall result in
the imposition of a five-percent penalty collected and assessed by the
appropriate entity.
§ 419-23 KENHORST CODE § 419-25
1:410
§ 419-25. Persons employed in multiple jurisdictions.
The LST payment shall be limited to one jurisdiction per person per payroll
period. In the event that the employee (taxpayer) works in more than one
taxing area, tax will be due in the area of residence, if employed there, or in
the absence of that criteria to the taxing authority closest to their place of
residence.
§ 419-26. Persons engaged in more than one occupation.
Each person who is engaged in more than one occupation shall be subject
to the payment of the tax on his principal occupation, and his principal
employer shall deduct the tax and deliver to him evidence of the deduction
on a form to be furnished to the employer by the Borough Manager or the
Receiver of Taxes, which form shall be evidence of the deduction having
been made and, when presented to any other employer, shall be authority
for such employer to not deduct the tax from the person's wages, but to
include such person on his return by setting forth his name, address and the
name and account number of the employer who deducted the tax.
§ 419-27. Nonresident employers.
All employers having their place of business outside the Borough, but
whose employees engage in an occupation within the Borough, are by
virtue thereof bound by and are subject to the provisions, penalties, and
regulations promulgated under this part. Furthermore, any employee of a
nonresident employer or any person engaged in an occupation within the
Borough may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person and, in the event the tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the
option of proceeding against either the employer, or the employee for the
collection of the tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 419-28. Administration of tax.
A. It shall be the duty of the Receiver of Taxes to accept and receive
payment of the tax and to keep record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Receiver of Taxes is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered to
adopt rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of this article, including provisions for
the examination of the payroll records of any employer subject to this
article, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this article, any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have
occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Receiver of
Taxes shall have the right to appeal to the Berks County Court of
Common Pleas as in other cases involved.

§ 419-29. Refund rules and regulations.
The rules and regulations for the refund process shall be as follows:
§ 419-30. Receipt of payment.
In the event a taxpayer requests receipt of payment, said receipt shall be
issued by the Tax Collector of the Borough.
§ 419-31. Suits for collection.
§ 419-32. Violations and penalties.195

in his custody and control, setting for the number of persons or employees
subject to this tax who are in his employment or whoever fails or refuses

payroll records of any employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain
the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Borough Administrator the means, facilities and opportunity for such
examination.
A. In the event that an individual should be subjected to more than one
deduction or payment, such individual so aggrieved may file a "claim for
refund" on a form prescribed by the Receiver of Taxes.
B. Whenever it occurs that an individual is not engaged in a business or
occupation within the corporate limits of the Borough of Kenhorst and
this tax was withheld or paid, such individual so aggrieved may file a
"claim for refund" on a form prescribed by the Director.
C. Claim for refund must be submitted to the Borough within three years
of the due date for the filing of the tax return or report as extended or
within one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later.
A. In the event that the tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the dates set forth above, the Receiver of Taxes may sue for
the recovery of the tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of the tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax, and a penalty of 10% shall be added to the flat rate of the tax
for nonpayment thereof. When suit is brought for the recovery of the
tax, the person liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and
liable for the costs of collection including reasonable attorney's fees.

resources necessary to pursue such delinquent tax. The Taxing Authority

delinquent taxpayer by any third-party collection agency engaged by the
Collector, provided such fee does not exceed 25% of the amount of tax
collected from any such Taxpayer. The Collector acknowledges that in the
case of any unfair collection practices by its agents or any third-party
agency, it shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Taxing Authority

defend, which is a material condition of this article.

shall be applicable:
D. In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed,
lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes
and additions, Council may, by resolution, adopt a new Official Zoning
Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors
or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction

destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining
shall be preserved, together with all applicable records pertaining to its
adoption or amendment.

railroad tracks, rivers or creeks, such district boundaries shall be
construed as being parallel to the center or right-of-way lines at such

the generalized application of the district regulation in association with this
chapter:
F. Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single
ownership at the effective date of this chapter, at the election of the
property owner, the regulations of either zoning district may be
extended a distance of not more than 50 feet beyond the district
boundary line onto the remaining portion of the lot.
A. No building, structure or land shall be used and no building, structure
or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, assembled, moved,
enlarged, reconstructed, removed or structurally altered without the
issuance of a zoning and/or building permit by the designated person or
firm authorized by Council. No building, structure or land shall be
occupied without the issuance of a certificate of use and occupancy by
the designated person or firm authorized by Council.
B. No part of a yard, common open space, other open space or off-street
parking or loading space required in connection with one structure,
building or use of the land shall be included as part of a yard, common
open space, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly
required for any other structure, building or use of the land, except as
permitted or required by this chapter or other Borough ordinance or
regulation.
C. No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter, which
meets the requirements of this chapter, shall be reduced in dimension
or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter. A
yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall not be
further reduced below the minimum requirements of this chapter.
D. Where district regulations specify a minimum lot width at the street
line, the minimum lot width shall be provided contiguous along the
street line of one street. It is prohibited, when calculating the width of a
lot, to add widths along the street lines of two or more streets. In the
case of a corner lot, the minimum lot width must be provided along the
street line of one street, but does not have to be provided along the
street line of each street on which the lot fronts.
E. Where district regulations specify a minimum lot width at the building
setback line, the minimum lot width shall be provided contiguous along
the building setback line established from one street. It is prohibited,
when calculating the width of a lot, to add widths along the building
setback lines established from two or more streets. In the case of a
corner lot, the minimum lot width must be provided along the building
setback line established from one street, but does not have to be
provided along the building setback line established from each street
on which the lot fronts.
§ 475-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-13
1:509
F. In the case of a lot of irregular shape in which a portion of the lot abuts
a street and a portion not abutting a street abuts the rear yards of lots
which have frontage on the same street as does the irregularly shaped
lot, on the irregularly shaped lot a building setback line shall be
established from the abutting rear yards. As a minimum, the building
setback requirement of the applicable zoning district shall be used in
establishing such building setback line.
G. No person shall alter the use of any land, or erect, alter, convert, move
or add to any building, structure or sign, without complying with the
requirements of all Borough ordinances and the Zoning Officer or the
person or firm designated by Borough Council issues a zoning permit to
the person/applicant for said change or construction. No zoning permit
is required for normal maintenance and repairs.

§ 475-64. Mobile home foundation requirements.
§ 475-65. Environmental and historical assessment statement.
A. Each mobile home shall be provided with a permanent concrete or
masonry foundation that will not heave, shift, settle or move due to
front action, inadequate drainage, vibration or other forces acting on
the foundation. The foundation shall be of adequate size, material and
construction so as to be durable and adequate for the support of the
maximum anticipated loads during all seasons of the year. An open
space between a mobile home floor and a mobile home foundation shall
be permanently enclosed to prevent unauthorized entry and to conceal
supports and utility connections. Every mobile home shall be anchored
to the wind forces and uplift. The anchorage shall be adequate to
withstand wind forces and uplift as specified for buildings and
structures in the current building code of the Borough.271
B. The application for placement of the mobile home shall be accompanied
by specifications for the foundation and anchoring and calculations
indicating that the foundation and anchoring are adequate to meet the
standards of this section.
A. Applicability.
(1) An environmental and historical assessment statement shall be
required for any subdivision plan creating three or more lots.
(2) The assessment statement shall be prepared by a qualified
professional. Qualifications of the professional shall be submitted
by the Borough.
(3) For the environmental assessment, the study and statement shall
be completed by a professional engineer, wetlands scientist,
biologist, or related disciplines hired by the applicant.
(4) For the historical assessment, the study and statement shall be
completed by an expert in historic preservation, historical
architecture, or related disciplines hired by the applicant.
B. Content of assessment statements. The purpose of the assessment is to
determine the impact of the project on the existing site and the
resultant changes the proposal will have on the immediate site and
surrounding area. In the preparation of this document, only factual
information, not subjective qualitative statements, shall be presented.
(1) Overall description. Describe the proposed or recommended
actions, its purposes, where it is to be located, when it is proposed
to take place and its interrelationship with other projects or
proposals, including information and technical data sufficient to
permit assessment of environmental impact by reviewing agencies.

§ 475-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-65
1:573
(2) Environmental description. Include a comprehensive description of
the existing environmental characteristics without the proposal
and the probable future environment with the proposals. This
description should focus both on the environmental details most
likely to be affected by the proposal and on broader regional
aspects of the environment, including ecological interrelationships,
existing land use, and wildlife habitat. Particular attention should
be given to the potential effects of past or present use of this site as
a dumping ground, repository of toxic or hazardous wastes, or
other potential sources of contamination.
(3) Historical description. Include a comprehensive description of the
historic resources in and around the site that will or may be
impacted. The description should focus on both registered and
unregistered buildings, sites, and areas. Particular attention should
be given to potential noise, light and aesthetic impacts from the
proposal.
(4) The environmental and historical impact of the proposed action.
These impacts are defined as direct or indirect changes in the
existing environment, historical structures and character of the
area, either beneficial or detrimental. These impacts should be
quantified. This discussion should include the impact not only upon
the natural environment but upon land as well. Provide separate
discussions for such potential impacts as man-caused accidents
and natural catastrophes and their probabilities and risks. Specific
mention should also be made of unknown or partially understood
impacts.
(5) Mitigating measures included in the proposed action. Include a
discussion of measures which are proposed to be taken or which
are required to be taken to enhance, protect or mitigate impacts
upon the environment, including any associated research or
monitoring. The beneficial and adverse effects of the alternatives
should be discussed, along with the reasons for rejection. Where
appropriate, consideration should be given to alternate
construction methods which may avoid degradation.

Department of Transportation.
HEIGHT  For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones
set forth in this section and shown on the Zoning Map, the datum shall
be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
HORIZONTAL SURFACE (ZONE)  An imaginary plan 150 feet above
the established airport elevation that is constructed by swinging arcs of
various radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then
connecting the adjacent arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is
based on the planned approach.
LARGER-THAN-UTILITY RUNWAY  A runway that is constructed for

this section, there is hereby created and established a certain zone
which includes all of the land lying beneath the approach surface as it
applies to the Reading Regional Airport, and is shown on the Zoning
District Map.
D. Airport surface zone height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in
this section, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and
no tree or other natural growth shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this section to a height in excess of the applicable height
limit herein established for such zone. The datum for all height limits
shall be mean sea level elevation. Such applicable height limitations are
hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
(1) Utility runway visual approach surface zone. Slopes 20 feet
outward for each one foot upward beginning at the end of the
runway and at the same elevation as the primary surface, 343 feet
§ 475-70 KENHORST CODE § 475-70
1:580
above mean sea level, and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway center line.
(2) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure, or growth of any tree or other natural growth to a height
up to 35 feet above the surface of the land.
E. Airport zoning requirements.
(1) Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone
established by this section in such a manner as to create electronic
interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare or
smoke in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in
any other way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(2) Nonconforming uses.
(a) Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
section shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree
or other natural growth not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with
the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained
herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration,
or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration
of which has begun prior to the effective date of this chapter,
and is diligently executed.
(b) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding
provision of this section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree or other natural growth is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon nearby of such markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Administrator to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport
the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and
light shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the
expense of the owner, municipality, or Reading Regional
Airport.
F. Permits and variances. The following specific requirements pertaining
to permits and variances within the Airport Hazard District shall be
applicable in addition to the ordinance requirements:
(1) Future uses. Except as specifically provided hereunder, no material
change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be
§ 475-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-70
1:581
erected or otherwise established, and no tree or other natural
growth shall be planted in any zone hereby created within this
section unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose
for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure,
or tree or other natural growth would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the
permit shall be granted.
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any structure or
tree or other natural growth less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land
contour or topographic features, such structure or tree or
other natural growth would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall
be required for any structure or tree or other natural growth
less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when such structure or tree or other natural growth, because
of terrain, land contour, or topographic feature, would extend
above the height limit prescribed for such transitions zones.
(d) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any
tree or other natural growth in excess of any of the height
limits established by this section, except that no permit is
required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height
of an existing structure.
(2) Existing uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be
replaced, substantially altered or rebuilt or any nonconforming tree
or other natural growth is allowed to grow higher or replanted, a
permit must be secured from the Zoning Officer. No permit shall be
granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an
obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree or
other natural growth to become a greater hazard to air navigation
§ 475-70 KENHORST CODE § 475-70
1:582
than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments
thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
(3) Variance. As regulated by Act 164280 and defined by 14 CFR
77.13(a) (as amended or replaced), any person who plans to erect a
new structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect and
maintain any object (natural or man-made), in the vicinity of the
airport, shall first notify the Department's Bureau of Aviation (BOA)
by submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction
review of the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement
thereof. Any application for a variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the
effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this section may be
considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the Airport Manager (or person
of equal description) for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the Airport Manger (or person of equivalent
description) does not respond to the application within 15 days
after receipt, the Zoning Hearing Board may act without such input
to grant or deny said application. Any request for a variance shall
include documentation in compliance with 14 CFR Part 77, Subpart
B (FAA Form 7460-1, as amended or replaced). Determinations of
whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations
made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable air space. In particular, the request for a
variance shall consider which of the following categories the FAA
has placed the proposed construction in:
(a) No objection. The subject construction is determined not to
exceed obstruction standards, and marking/lighting is not
required to mitigate potential hazard. Under this
determination, a variance shall be granted.
(b) Conditional determination. The proposed construction/
alteration is determined to create some level of encroachment
into an airport hazard area which can be effectively mitigated.
Under this determination, a variance shall be granted
contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures.
(c) Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A
variance shall be denied, and the reasons for this
determination shall be outlined to the applicant.
(d) Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly
found that a literal application or enforcement of the
280. Editor's Note: See 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.
§ 475-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-70
1:583
§ 475-71. Unconventional gas operations and facilities.
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not
create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice and
will be in accordance with the intent of this section.
(4) Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permit or variance
under this section, the Zoning Hearing Board shall, if it deems the
action advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and
reasonable under the circumstances, so condition the permit or
variance to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and
light as may be required by guidelines or regulations adopted by
the Federal Aviation Administration.
(5) Notice to department. The Zoning Hearing Board, upon the
decision to grant a permit or variance under this section, shall
notify the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Aviation, of its decision. This notice shall be in writing and shall be
sent to the Department of Transportation at the same time as to the
applicant. The decision shall not be effective for 10 days after it is
rendered to allow the Department of Transportation time within
which to appeal the decision.
G. Acquisition of air rights. In any case in which it is desired to remove,
lower or otherwise terminate a nonconforming structure or use, or the
approach protection necessary cannot, because of constitutional
limitations, be provided by airport zoning regulations, or it appears
advisable that the necessary approach protection be provided by
acquisition of property rights, rather than by airport zoning regulations,
the Borough, or the authority owning the airport or served by it, may
acquire by purchase, grant or condemnation, in the manner provided by
the law under which the Borough is authorized to acquire real property
for public purposes, such air right, aviation easement or other estate or
interest in the property or nonconforming structure or use in question
as may be necessary to effectuate the purpose of this section. In the
case of the purchase of any property or any easement or estate, or
interest therein, or the acquisition thereof by the power of eminent
domain, the Borough or authority shall, in addition to the damages for
the taking, injury or destruction of property, also pay the cost of the
removal and the relocation of any structure or any public utility which is
required to be moved to a new location. The Borough must be notified
by the Airport Authority in such case.
A. All unconventional gas operations and facilities shall be governed by
Title 58 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes.
B. Well and pipeline location assessment operations, including seismic
operations and related activities conducted in accordance with all
applicable federal and state laws and regulations shall be permitted in
all zoning districts.
§ 475-70 KENHORST CODE § 475-71
1:584
C. Kenhorst Borough shall have a review period of 120 days for conditional
use review of all activities related to the development of unconventional
gas operations and facilities.
D. All wells shall be located in accordance with Section 3215 of PA Title 58,
"Oil and Gas."281

§ 475-72. Application and intent.
§ 475-73. Nonconforming lots of record.
A. Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or subsequent
amendments thereto, there exists or will exist certain nonconformities
which, if lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, may be
continued, subject to certain limitations, although such
nonconformities would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendments thereto.
B. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and on which
actual building construction has been diligently carried on.
A. Any lot shown on a recorded subdivision plan on the effective date of
this chapter or after the enactment of subsequent amendments thereto
which does not meet the minimum size or width requirements of the

upon the applicant. In granting any variance, the Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. The Board may, by rule,
prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary
application to the Zoning Officer or the person or firm designated by

Borough Council and Planning Commission to review and comment on
the application prior to rendering a decision. The Board may grant a
variance; provided that all the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such condition and not circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, as granted by the Board, is the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(6) The approval of a variance, if authorized by the Board, which
anticipates construction or modification of a structure, creation of
new or revised lot lines or dimensional standards for a property or
284. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

or revised lot lines or dimensional standards or change of use or
occupancy be initiated within said one-year term or said term is
expressly extended as part of the initial approval. In the event
that the activity anticipated by the variance should not be initiated
within one year of the approval or such additional term as may
be expressed in the approval or should the activity which is the
subject of the variance be discontinued, the premises or structure
or structure situated thereon shall not thereafter be used, except in

action shall be taken on any application or appeal.

only such special exceptions which the Board, by the provisions of this
chapter, is specifically authorized to issue. The granting of a special
exception, when specifically authorized by the terms of this chapter,
shall be subject to the following standards and criteria. The applicant
for a special exception shall demonstrate, as a condition to approval of
his application, compliance with these criteria and those criteria
specified elsewhere in this chapter for the use in question. In all cases,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall request Borough Council and Planning
Commission to review and comment on the application prior to
rendering a decision.

exception use in the zoning district wherein the applicant seeks a
special exception.
(2) Such special exceptions shall only be granted, subject to any
applicable conditions and safeguards as required by this chapter.

neighborhood, the conservation of property values and/or the
health and safety of residents or workers on adjacent properties
and in the general neighborhood.

to its access streets that vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and
from such use will not create undue congestion or hazards

the proposed use by the applicant.
(6) The granting of the special exception shall be consistent with the
Borough Comprehensive Plan.

thereafter expire and be void, unless said construction,
modification, new or revised lot lines or dimensional standards or
change of use or occupancy be initiated within said one-year term
