Install adequate excavation supports as specified in Article VII.
Casing pipe installation methods.
Boring.
Install casing pipe with the determined vertical and horizontal alignment prior to
installation of the carrier pipe.
Push the pipe into the ground with a boring auger rotating within the pipe to remove the
spoil. Do not advance the cutting head ahead of the casing pipe except for that distance
necessary to permit the cutting teeth to cut clearance for the pipe. The machine bore and
cutting head arrangement shall be removable from within the pipe. Arrange the face of

one inch, grout to fill voids.
Jacking.
Construct adequate thrust wall normal to the proposed line of thrust.
Impart thrust load to the pipe through a suitable thrust ring that is sufficiently rigid to
ensure distribution of the thrust load on the pipe.
Drilling and jacking:
Use an oil-field-type rock roller bit or plate bit made up of individual roller cutter units
solidly welded to the pipe which is turned and pushed for its entire length by the drilling
machine to give the bit the necessary cutting action.
Inject a high-density slurry (oil field drilling mud) to the head as a cutter lubricant. Inject
slurry at the rear of the cutter units to prevent jetting action ahead of the pipe.
Mining and jacking. Utilize manual hand-mining excavation from within the casing pipe as it is
advanced with jacks, allowing minimum ground standup time ahead of the casing pipe.
Carrier pipe installation within casing pipe.

determined in accordance with AASHTO Designation T89. The plasticity index, as determined
by AASHTO Designation T90 for soils having liquid limits of 41 to 65 inclusive, shall be not
less than that determined by the formula:
Plasticity index = Liquid limit - 30.
Granular material. Granular material shall include all natural or synthetic mineral aggregates
having a maximum size that can be readily placed and compacted in loose eight-inch layers
and of which 35% or less shall pass the No. 200 sieve.
Shale. Shale shall include all rock-like materials formed by the natural consolidation of mud,
clay, silt and fine sand and usually thinly laminated, comparatively soft and easily split, having
a maximum size that can be readily placed and compacted in loose eight-inch layers.
Rock. Rock shall include all igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock having a maximum
size that can be readily placed and compacted in loose eight-inch layers and which generally
has sufficient fines to normally fill all the voids in each layer.
Random materials. Random material shall include any combination of the above
classifications and may include old concrete, brick, etc., from demolition having a maximum
size that can be readily placed and compacted in loose eight-inch layers, and which have
been approved by the municipality.

Comply with state and local codes, permits and regulations.
Salvage topsoil. Within the areas indicated for grading, strip topsoil to the depth of suitable topsoil
material and stockpile for subsequent topsoiling operations. See Article IV.
Placement of fill material.
After removal of topsoil, areas to receive fill shall be thoroughly rolled, and any soft spots
disclosed by rolling shall be excavated and the unsuitable material removed and disposed of
in a waste area. The excavated area shall be filled with suitable fill material approved by the
municipality and recompacted. Suitable fill material shall be spread in layers of not more than
eight inches (loose) over the full area of the fill, and compacted to the required density by the
use of compaction equipment. All fill material shall be compacted to not less than 95% of its
maximum dry weight density at its optimum moisture content, plus or minus 2%, as
determined by ASTM D698, under roadways, shoulders, driveways, curbs, sidewalks, gravel
and sand parking areas and not less than 90% in yards, fields and sand areas. When the
material is too coarse to satisfactorily use these methods, compaction will be determined by
the municipality based on nonmovement of the material under the compaction equipment.
Fill material placed in areas inaccessible to the compaction equipment shall be placed in
uniform loose layers not exceeding four inches in depth and compacted by means of
approved mechanical tampers to the density requirements herein specified.
When a previously constructed fill requires additional material to bring it to required elevation,
the top of the fill shall be thoroughly scarified before the required additional material is placed.
Material containing moisture in excess of that percentage which will ensure satisfactory
compaction shall not be placed in the fill, and fill material shall not be placed on material that
has become unstable due to excessive moisture.
Frozen fill material shall not be placed in fills, and fill material shall not be placed on frozen
material. If during construction the top of the fill freezes, all frozen material shall be removed
before additional material is placed.
In no case shall waste material be disposed of in the flood channel or floodway area of any
stream.
Shale and random material containing an excessive quantity of large fragments shall be so
placed that the coarser material is in areas where no building foundations or utility trenches
are to be located. The large pieces shall then be broken down by the use of approved
equipment until all voids are filled. Mixtures of shale and rock shall be placed in accordance
with the requirements for placing shale.
Where fill is to be constructed on a slope, the slope shall be benched to the width and depth
shown on the drawings or as approved by the municipality.
Excavation. Perform excavation of borrow material in a manner satisfactory to the municipality.
Strip borrow pits of brush, trees, roots, grass and other vegetation prior to removal of material for
use in fill. During the excavation operation, grade the borrow area to ensure free drainage of water
from the area. Place and maintain erosion control devices after completion of the excavation,
grade the excavated area, including side slopes, to drain and present a uniformly trim appearance
merging into the surrounding terrain. After borrowing operations are complete, regrade area, if
necessary, to prevent erosion.

On prepared subgrade (or subbase if required), spread limestone screenings (AASHTO
No. 10) to a depth of one inch and compact.
Construct stone base of AASHTO No. 1 aggregate to the compacted depth specified in
the standard details.
Spreading coarse material. The coarse material shall be spread uniformly on the initial
layer of fine material by approved mechanical stone spreaders to the full width of the
base unless otherwise specified for part-width construction. Spreaders shall be adjusted
to spread the loose material to obtain a layer of the required depth after compaction. In
areas inaccessible to spreading equipment, the material may be spread directly from
trucks provided the distribution is equivalent to that achieved by the spreader. All
segregated material shall be removed and replaced with well-graded material. The
coarse material shall not be spread for a distance of more than an average day's work
ahead of choking and compacting.
Compacting coarse material. Immediately after surface corrections have been made to
the spread coarse material, it shall be thoroughly compacted. The rolling shall begin at
the sides and progress to the center, except on superelevated curves where the rolling
shall begin on the low side and progress to the high side. The rolling shall be parallel with
the center line of the roadway, uniformly lapping each preceding track, covering the entire
surface with the rear wheels ahead of the roller wheels. After each layer of material has
been spread and compacted, it shall be checked with approved templates and
straightedges, and all irregularities shall be satisfactorily corrected. Red flags shall be
placed at the limits of satisfactorily compacted coarse material. The flags shall be moved
ahead as additional material is compacted, and no filler shall be applied to the coarse
material in advance of the flag-marked sections.
Application of fine material. After the coarse material has been set and keyed by
compaction, dry limestone screenings (AASHTO No. 10), in an amount equal to
approximately 50% of that required to fill the voids in the coarse material, shall be spread
uniformly over the surface. The vibratory compaction equipment shall then be operated
over the surface to cause the screenings to settle into the voids. The remaining
screenings shall be spread and vibrated in one or more applications to satisfactorily fill
the voids; however, the quantity of screenings used and the operation of filling shall not
cause floatation of the coarse aggregate. Areas not completely filled, in the foregoing
operations, shall be filled by manual methods and need not be further vibrated.
Compacting and bonding. After completing the vibration of the fine material, the surface
of single-layer construction, or the surface of each layer of multilayer construction, shall
be sprinkled with water and rolled. All excess screenings forming in piles or cakes upon
the surface shall be loosened and scattered by sweeping, exercising care that the fine
material is not removed below the top of the coarse aggregate. On the surface of singlelayer
construction or the top layer of multilayer construction, the sprinkling and rolling
shall be continued and additional screenings applied where necessary until all voids are
filled and until a slight wave of grout forms in front of the roller wheels. Brooms attached
to the roller, and hand brooms, shall be used to distribute the grout uniformly into the
unfilled voids. After the wave of grout has been produced over the entire section of the
base course, this portion shall be left to dry. The surface shall be sprinkled and rerolled
as required to bond it thoroughly and to secure a satisfactory surface. The quantity of
screenings and water used shall be sufficient to produce a smooth, hard monolithic
surface.

the placement of the surface course. No traffic shall be allowed on the base course other
than necessary local traffic and that developing from the operation of essential
construction equipment. Any defects which may develop in the construction of the base
course or any damage caused by the operation of local or job traffic is the responsibility
of the contractor and shall be immediately repaired or replaced at no expense to the
municipality.
Crushed aggregate base course, alternate.
Compaction shall be achieved by means of approved static or vibratory equipment. If
static roller is used, base course of more than eight inches shall be constructed in two
lifts. If approved vibratory roller is used, base course up to 10 inches compacted
thickness may be constructed in one course.
On prepared subgrade (or subbase if required), construct stone base of PennDOT 2A
coarse aggregate to the compacted depth specified on the standard details.
Spreading coarse material. The aggregate material shall be spread uniformly by
approved mechanical stone spreaders to the full width of the base unless otherwise
specified for part-width construction. Spreaders shall be adjusted to spread the loose
material to obtain a layer of the required depth after compaction. In areas inaccessible to
spreading equipment, the material may be spread directly from trucks, provided the
distribution is equivalent to that achieved by the spreader. All segregated material shall
be removed and replaced with well-graded material. The aggregate material shall not be

of the roadway, uniformly lapping each preceding track, covering the entire surface with
the rear wheels and continuing until the material does not creep or wave ahead of the
roller wheels. After each layer of material has been spread and compacted, it shall be
checked with approved templates and straightedges, and all irregularities shall be
satisfactorily corrected. Red flags shall be placed at the limits of satisfactorily compacted
material. The flags shall be moved ahead as additional material is compacted.

Surface tolerance. After the base course has been completed as specified, the surface
smoothness shall be checked with approved templates, string lines, or straightedges.
Templates. The contractor shall furnish and use approved templates of required length
and cut to the required crown of the finished surface of the base course, for checking the
crown and contour thereof. The templates shall be equipped with metal or other
approved vertical extensions attached to each end, so that the bottom of the template will
be at the elevation of the top of the aggregate. At least three such templates shall be
furnished and used at intervals of not more than 25 feet.
String lines. String lines, for controlling the finished elevation of the proposed base
course, shall be furnished with ample supports and offset along each side of the base
course, and shall be maintained until all irregularities have been satisfactorily corrected.
Straightedges. Approved straightedges 10 feet in length shall also be furnished and used
for testing longitudinal irregularities in the surface of the base course.
Surface irregularities. Any surface irregularities that exceed 1/2 inch shall be remedied by
loosening the surface and removing or adding material as required, after which the entire
area, including the surrounding surface, shall be rolled until satisfactorily compacted.
Tests for depth of finished base course. During the progress of the work, the depth of the
base course will be measured by the municipality and unsatisfactory work shall be repaired,
corrected, or replaced. The municipality will not be liable for payment for any excess depth of
base course. The initial layer of fine material placed as a bed and filler will be measured and
considered as part of the base course in determining the compacted depth of the finished
base course.
The depth will be determined by cutting or digging holes to the full depth of the completed
base course. One depth measurement shall be made for each 1,500 square yards, or
less, of completed base course. Any section in which the depth is 1/2 inch or more
deficient in specified depth shall be satisfactorily corrected at no expense to the
municipality.
All test holes shall be backfilled with similar material and satisfactorily compacted by and
at the expense of the contractor. This operation shall be performed under the observation
of the municipality who will check the depth for record purposes.
Field moisture-density tests. Conduct such tests as specified under Site Excavation and
Placement of Fill Material, Article VI.

plants in a protected area, with containers or balls six inches apart. Fill all voids with moist
mulch to the top of the container or ball.
Bare root plant material which arrives at the planting site shall be immediately removed from
the transport vehicle. Roots shall be covered with wet burlap or mulch to prevent drying.
Protect the plant material from sun and wind and keep fresh by the fine mist spraying, or by
other acceptable methods.
Protect plants at all times. All material left out of the ground, unprotected overnight, with roots
exposed to sun and wind, or unprotected during transit, unloading, storage, healing in or
during actual planting operations will be rejected.
Layout of plantings.
Delineate the plant pit locations, bed and planting area outlines. Identify the plants to be
placed at the delineated locations. Do not start excavation or cultivation until the locations and
outlines have been accepted by the municipality.
Should obstructions prevent planting at the indicated locations, alternate locations or
deletions will be determined by the municipality.
Shrub bed preparation. For areas indicated for bedding, prepare the area in the following manner
to attain the designed finished grade:
Remove sod and all undesirable growth and add additional topsoil if required to reestablish
grade.
Uniformly spread three inches of peat, then thoroughly incorporate it into the soil to a
minimum depth of six inches. As directed during this blending operation, remove and dispose
of undesirable material larger than two inches in any dimension.
Preparation of plant pits.
For bare root shrubs, vines, and seedling transplants, dig pits with vertical sides and flat
bottoms large enough to accommodate roots without crowding. For balled and burlapped
plants, the pit shall be twice the width of the ball diameter. For common periwinkle,
pachysandra, and ivy, provide only four inches of backfill mix beneath and around all sides of
the root system.
All plant pits designated for bare root or balled and burlapped plant stock shall be dug prior to
removing plants from temporary storage. Immediately before planting, scarify, loosen, or
roughen the sides of the plant pit.
If the soil conditions are deemed favorable to healthy plant growth, the municipality may direct
the contractor to dig the pit up to three times the root spread or balled diameter.
Pruning.
Typical top pruning, as directed, shall be performed appropriate for each species, variety,
size, or planting location. Typical pruning samples will serve as a guide for subsequent
pruning throughout the project.
Broken or badly bruised branches shall be removed with a clean cut. Pruning cuts over 3/4
inches in diameter shall be painted over with approved tree paint.
Prune the tops of deciduous shrubs prior to or immediately following planting. Prune
according to best horticultural practices regarding natural or desired form and growth
characteristics of the individual species. Unless otherwise directed, remove 1/4 to 1/3 of the

potential leaf-bearing surface from deciduous plants. Only trim or thin evergreens when and
as directed.
Root pruning shall only be performed to remove damaged or broken main roots. Cut
immediately above the damage with a clean oblique cut.
Planting.
Planting shall be performed when soil and climatic conditions are favorable and according to
the following schedule. Where local conditions warrant and at the direction of the municipality,
these dates may be extended:
Deciduous trees and shrubs: October 15 to May 15.
Evergreen trees: March 1 to May 15, August 1 to September 15.
Seedlings and seedling transplants: March 1 to May 15.
Plants shall be set plumb and at the specified depth. Plant material shall be handled by the
packaging material and not by the stem or branches. Remove plant containers or preformed
root protection devices which restrict root development immediately prior to planting. Balled
and burlapped material shall be placed in the plant pits intact.
Bare root material shall be planted immediately. To prevent root drying, use wet burlap, straw,
hay or other protective measures.
Fertilize in accordance with the fertilizer schedule. Cultivate and completely tamp backfill mix
around the ball or roots, in a manner that fills voids and eliminates air pockets. Use extreme
care to avoid damaging roots during backfilling and tamping operations. When backfilling is
2/3 complete, on balled and burlapped material cut the lacing around the main stem or trunk
then lay the burlap back. Thoroughly water the plant. After absorption of all water, complete
the backfill operation and water again.
Where indicated, install the weed barrier mat to match the diameter of the plant pit or other
designated area and staple. Mulch area as required.
Wrap deciduous shade and flowering tree trunks from the ground line to the lowest main
branches, overlapping the wrap one inch to 1 1/2 inches. Tie the wrapping at the top, middle
and bottom and at a minimum of two other places.
If staking and guying is required, perform that operation immediately after completion of
backfilling.
Install tree protectors around the base of deciduous and flowering trees with the bottom of the
protector extending through the mulch and being in contact with the backfill material.
Maintenance of planting.
All plants shall be maintained in living, healthy conditions until the entire project has been
accepted. Plants are required to be growing in place at least 30 days prior to project
acceptance. During this period of establishment, perform necessary maintenance functions
such as weeding, spraying, remulching and watering as required or directed.
Watering shall be performed during the period of establishment promptly and with sufficient
personnel and equipment to complete any directed operation within five calendar days of
such direction. Furnish measurements and capacities of water tanks to be used in the
watering operation along with a watering schedule for approval.
Tighten guys and stakes that may become loosened.

Preparation before placing.
Hardened concrete and foreign materials shall be removed from the inner surfaces of the
conveying equipment.
Formwork shall be completed; snow, ice and water shall be removed; reinforcement shall
be secured in place; expansion joint material, anchors, and other embedded items shall
be positioned; and the entire preparation shall be accepted.
Concrete shall not be placed on frozen ground.
Conveying.
Concrete shall be handled from the mixer to the place of final deposit as rapidly as
practicable by methods which will prevent segregation or loss of ingredients and in a
manner which will assure that the required quality of the concrete is maintained.
Conveying equipment shall be of a size and design such that detectable setting of
concrete shall not occur before adjacent concrete is placed. Conveying equipment shall
be cleaned at the end of each operation or work day.
Truck mixers, agitators and nonagitating units and their manner of operation shall
conform to the applicable requirements of ASTM C94.
Belt conveyors shall be horizontal or at a slope which will not cause excessive
segregation or loss of ingredients. Concrete shall be protected against undue drying
or rise in temperature. An acceptable arrangement shall be used at the discharge
end to prevent segregation. Mortar shall not be allowed to adhere to the return
length of the belt. Long runs shall be discharged into a hopper or through a baffle.
Chutes shall be metal or metal-lined and shall have a slope not exceeding one
vertical to two horizontal and not less than one vertical to three horizontal. Chutes
more than 20 feet long and chutes not meeting the slope requirements may be used
provided they discharge into a hopper before distribution.
Pumping or pneumatic conveying equipment shall be capable of pumping the
specified mix with adequate pumping capacity. Pneumatic placement shall be
controlled so that segregation is not apparent in the discharged concrete. The loss of
slump in pumping or pneumatic conveying equipment shall not exceed two inches.
Concrete shall not be conveyed through pipe made of aluminum or aluminum alloy.
Depositing.
General. Concrete shall be deposited continuously, or in layers of such thickness that no
concrete will be deposited on concrete which has hardened sufficiently to cause the
formation of seams or planes of weakness within the section. If a section cannot be
placed continuously, construction joints shall be located as indicated on the drawings.
Placing shall be carried on at such a rate that the concrete which is being integrated with
fresh concrete is still plastic. Concrete which has partially hardened or has been
contaminated by foreign materials shall not be deposited.
Segregation. Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its final position to
avoid segregation due to rehandling or flowing. Concrete shall not be subjected to any
procedure which will cause segregation.
Consolidation. All concrete shall be consolidated by vibration, spading, rodding or forking
so that the concrete is thoroughly worked around the reinforcement, around embedded
items, and into corners of forms, eliminating all air or stone pockets which may cause
honeycombing, pitting, or planes of weakness. Internal vibrators used shall be the largest

size and the most powerful that can be properly used in the work. They shall be operated
by competent workmen. Use of vibrators to transport concrete within forms shall not be
allowed. Vibrators shall be inserted and withdrawn at points approximately 18 inches
apart. At each insertion, the duration shall be sufficient to consolidate the concrete but
not sufficient to cause segregation, generally from five to 15 seconds. A spare vibrator
shall be kept on the job site during all concrete placing operations. Where the concrete is
to have an as-cast finish, a full surface of mortar shall be brought against the form by the
vibration process, supplemented if necessary by spading to work the coarse aggregate
back from the formed surface.
Protection.
Unless adequate protection is provided, concrete shall not be placed during rain, sleet or
snow.
Rainwater shall not be allowed to increase the mixing water nor to damage the surface
finish.
The temperature of the concrete as placed shall not be so high as to cause difficulty from
loss of slump, flash set, or cold joints and should not exceed 90° F. When the
temperature of the steel is greater that 120° F., steel forms and reinforcement shall be
sprayed with water just prior to placing the concrete.
Finishing of formed surfaces. If the finish is not designated on the drawings, the following finishes
shall be used as applicable:
Rough form finish for all concrete surfaces not permanently exposed. Tie holes and defects
shall be patched and fins over 1/4 inches in heights rubbed off.
Smooth rubbed finish for all concrete surfaces permanently exposed. Apply on newly
hardened concrete within one day following form removal. Surfaces shall be wetted and
rubbed until uniform color and texture are produced.
Slabs.
General. Concrete for slabs shall be as specified in Subsection A.
Preparation of subgrade for slabs on ground.
The subgrade shall be well drained and of adequate and uniform load-bearing capacity.
The minimum in-place density of the subgrade soils shall be not less than 95% of its
maximum dry-weight density at its optimum moisture content, plus or minus 2%, as
determined by ASTM D698.
The subgrade shall be free of frost before concrete placing begins. If the temperature
inside a building where concrete is to be placed is below freezing it shall be raised and
maintained above 50° F. long enough to remove all frost from the subgrade.
The subgrade shall be moist at the time of concreting. If necessary, it shall be dampened
with water in advance of concreting, but there shall not be standing water on the
subgrade nor any muddy or soft spots when the concrete is placed.
Finishes.
Floated finish. After the concrete has been placed, consolidated, struck off, and leveled,
the concrete shall not be worked further until ready for floating. Floating with a hand float
or with a bladed power trowel equipped with float shoes, or with a powered disc float,
shall begin when the water sheen has disappeared and when the surface has stiffened
sufficiently to permit the operation. During or after the first floating, planeness of surface

shall be checked with a ten-foot straightedge applied at not less than two different
angles. All high spots shall be cut down and all low spots filled and the slab shall then be
refloated immediately to a uniform sandy texture.
Broom or belt finish. Immediately after the concrete has received a float finish, it shall be
given a coarse transverse scored texture by drawing a broom or burlap belt across the
surface.
Unspecified finish. When type of finish is not specified on the drawings, use broom finish.
Curing and protection.
General. Beginning immediately after placement, concrete shall be protected from premature
drying, excessively hot or cold temperatures, and mechanical injury, and shall be maintained
with minimal moisture loss at a relatively constant temperature for the period necessary for
hydration of the cement and hardening of the concrete.
Preservation of moisture.
For concrete surfaces not in contact with forms, one of the following procedures shall be
applied immediately after completion of placement and finishing:
Application of acceptable moisture-retaining covering as approved by the
municipality.
Application of a curing compound conforming to ASTM C309. The compound shall
be applied in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer
immediately after any water sheen which may develop after finishing has
disappeared from the concrete surface. It shall not be used on any surface against
which additional concrete or other material is to be bonded unless it is proven that
the curing compound will not prevent bond, or unless positive measures are taken to
remove it completely from areas to receive bonded applications.
Moisture loss from surfaces placed against wooden forms or metal forms exposed to
heating by the sun shall be minimized by keeping the forms wet until they can be safely
removed. After form removal the concrete shall be cured.
Curing shall be continued for at least seven days. Alternatively, if tests are made of
cylinders kept adjacent to the structure and cured by the same methods, moistureretention
measures may be terminated when the average compressive strength has
reached 70% of the strength, f'c. Moisture-retention measures may also be terminated
when the temperature of the concrete is maintained at least at 50° F. for the same length
of time that laboratory-cured cylinders, representative of the concrete in-place, require to
achieve 85% of f'c.
Temperature, wind, and humidity.
Cold weather. When the mean daily outdoor temperature is less than 40° F., the
temperature of the concrete shall be maintained between 50° and 70° F. for the required
curing period. When necessary, arrangements for heating, covering, insulating, or
housing the concrete work shall be made in advance of placement and shall be adequate
to maintain the required temperature without injury due to concentration of heat.
Combustion heaters shall not be used during the first 24 hours unless precautions are
taken to prevent exposure of the concrete to exhaust gases which contain carbon
dioxide.
Hot weather. When necessary, provision for windbreaks, shading, fog spraying,
sprinkling, ponding, or wet covering with a light colored material shall be made in

advance of placement, and such protective measures shall be taken as quickly as
concrete hardening and finishing operations will allow.
Rate of temperature change. Changes in temperature of the air immediately adjacent to
the concrete during and immediately following the curing period shall be kept as uniform
as possible and shall not exceed 5° F. in any one-hour or 50° F. in any twenty-four-hour
period.
Protection from mechanical injury. During the curing period, the concrete shall be protected
from damage due to mechanical disturbances, such as load stresses, heavy shock, and
excessive vibration. All finished concrete surfaces shall be protected from damage by
construction equipment, materials or methods, by application of curing procedures, and by
rain or running water.
Testing.
General. Concrete materials and operations will be tested and inspected as the work
progresses. Failure to detect any defective work or material shall not in any way prevent later
rejection when such defect is discovered nor shall it obligate the municipality for final
acceptance.
Testing services. The following testing services shall be performed by the designated testing
agency.
Conduct strength tests of the concrete during construction in accordance with the
following procedures:
Secure composite samples in accordance with ASTM C172. Each sample shall be
obtained from a different batch of concrete on a random basis, avoiding any
selection of the test batch other than by a number selected at random before
commencement of concrete placement.
Mold and cure four specimens from each sample in accordance with ASTM C31.
Any deviations from the requirements of this standard shall be recorded in the test
report.
Test the specimens in accordance with ASTM C39. Two specimens shall be tested
at 28 days for acceptance and two shall be tested at seven days for information. The
acceptance test results shall be the average of the strengths of the two specimens
tested at 28 days. If one specimen in a test manifests evidence of improper
sampling, molding or testing, it shall be discarded and the strength of the remaining
cylinder shall be considered the test result. Should both specimens in a test show
any of the above defects, the entire test shall be discarded.
Make at least one strength test for each 50 cubic yard, or fraction thereof, of each
mixture design of concrete placed in any one day.
Determine slump of the concrete sample for each strength test and whenever
consistency of concrete appears to vary, using ASTM C 143.
Determine air content of the concrete sample for each strength test in accordance with
either ASTM C231, ASTM C173, or ASTM C138.
Determine temperature of the concrete sample for each strength test.
Additional services when required. The following services shall be performed by the testing
agency when required by the municipality at the contractor's expense:

Such notice shall set forth that in the event the person should fail to obey the nuisance, the
Borough may at once cause the same to be abated and charge the cost and expense incurred in
abating the nuisance to the person and where such nuisance involves real estate to cause the
same to become a lien against said property as permitted by the Borough Code.[1]

being entered as a municipal lien against the property where such nuisances involved real estate,
provided that the owner was given notice of the nuisance, together with a ten-percent penalty and

reasonably prudent manner.
The Borough may proceed with an action at law or in equity to require the abatement of the

such order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall comply
therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Building Appeals Board shall be afforded a hearing as
soon as possible. After such hearing, depending upon the findings as to whether the provisions of this
chapter have been complied with, the Codes Enforcement Officer and the Borough Manager shall
continue such order in effect or modify or revoke it. The costs of such emergency repair, vacation or
demolition of such dangerous building shall be collected in the same manner as provided herein for

Open drainageways. When open drainageways are used for the disposal of stormwater, the
Borough Engineer shall review the design of such open drainageways in relation to the following:
Safety. Steep banks and deep pools shall be avoided.

properties.
In no case may any slope exceed the normal angle of slippage of the material involved. All
slopes must be protected against erosion.

where relevant in a given case:
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness or
shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or zone in which the property is located.
Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property
can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or zone
in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will provide relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulation in existence.
Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.
§ 224-43. Special exceptions.
Filing of special exceptions.

Zoning Hearing Board. In addition to the information on the building permit application, the
special exception application must show:
Ground floor plans and elevations of proposed structures.
Names and addresses of adjoining owners.
Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Zoning Hearing Board, a special exception
authorized by the Board expires if the application fails to obtain, where required to do so, a
building permit or use certificate within six months of the date of the authorization of the
special exception.
Temporary special exceptions.
A temporary special exception must be obtained from the Zoning Hearing Board for any
nonconformity which is or will be seasonal or is or will be in the public interest. The Zoning
Hearing Board may grant a temporary special exception for a nonconforming use or structure,
existing or new, which:
Is beneficial to the public health or general welfare;
Is necessary to promote the proper development of the community; or
Is seasonal in nature.
The temporary special exception may be issued for a period not exceeding one year and may
be renewed for an aggregate period not exceeding three years. The nonconforming structure

Referral to Planning Commission. All applications for a special exception shall be referred to the

Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board, in passing upon special exception applications, may
attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public welfare and the Comprehensive Plan,
including conditions which are more restrictive than those established for other uses in the same
zone.
Application of extent-of-use regulations. The extent-of-use regulations as set forth in this chapter
must be followed by the Zoning Hearing Board. Where no extent-of-use regulations are set forth
for the particular use, the Board must impose extent-of-use requirements as necessary to protect
the public welfare and the Comprehensive Plan.
General standards.
A special exception may be granted when the Zoning Hearing Board finds from a
preponderance of the evidence produced at the hearing that:
The proposed use, including its nature, intensity and location, is in harmony with the
orderly and appropriate development of the zone;
Adequate water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage and fire and police protection
are or can be provided for the use;
The use of adjacent land and buildings will not be discouraged and the value of adjacent
land and buildings will not be impaired by the location, nature and height of buildings,
walls and fences;
The use will have proper location with respect to existing or future streets giving access
to it and will not create traffic congestion or cause industrial or commercial traffic to use
residential streets; and
The specific standards set forth for each particular use for which a special exception may
be granted have been met.
The applicant for a special exception shall have the burden of proof, which shall include the
burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion on all questions of
fact which are to be determined by the Zoning Hearing Board.
Special standards. In addition to the general standards for all special exceptions as contained in
Subsection F, the specific standards for particular uses as listed in Article VI must be met prior to
