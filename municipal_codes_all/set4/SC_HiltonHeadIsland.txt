PREFACE 
The Town of Hilton Head Island was incorporated in 1983. Upon the passage of a series of basic ordinances, the Town put together a code, in a title arrangement like that of the South Carolina Code of 1976, with three-part section numbers, the first representing the title, the second the chapter, and the third the position of the section within the chapter. This typewritten Code was printed by Municipal Code Corporation, as updated by the Town through June 1, 1984. 
In the spring and summer of 1985, the Town undertook the next phase in the development of its Code—an editorial analysis of the Town's basic Code and ordinances in conjunction with the republishing of the Code in professionally typeset, large-page, double-column format by Municipal Code. A backlog of ordinances was also incorporated and the entire Code was indexed. 
Related portions of the Code were tied together through the use of cross references, state law references to relevant portions of the South Carolina Code of 1976 were appended and a table of ordinances created. By using the Code Comparative Table, the reader of this volume can locate the precise section added or amended by any ordinance. 
Throughout all early phases of the project, the publisher relied upon the unfailing support and enthusiasm of the members of the Town's professional staff—in particular Shirley Freeman, Clerk/Treasurer; Greg Walker, Staff Attorney; and Carey F. Smith, Town Manager. 
Subsequently, demand for the Town Code proved high enough that, in conjunction with the publication of the first supplement to the Code, undertaken in the spring of 1989, 50 additional copies were printed, with Supplement No. 1 pages already inserted. 
This volume is presented in the hope that the Town will find it a useful tool in the day-to-day administration of its affairs.

The town manager or his duly authorized agent, upon receiving notice of the existence of any condition declared by this chapter to be a nuisance, shall serve written notice upon the property owner or person responsible for such condition to clean up the premises and abate such nuisance within fifteen (15) days. It shall be sufficient notification to deliver the written notice or a copy thereof to the person to whom it is addressed or to deposit a copy of such notice in the United States mail properly stamped and directed to such person at his last known address and post a copy thereof on the premises upon which the nuisance exists. Upon failure of the person(s) to whom the notice is directed to remove and abate the nuisance, as provided for herein, within fifteen (15) days after notice or upon the town's receipt of written notification that abatement of the nuisance is beyond the means of the property owner or responsible person, the employees or agents of the town may enter upon the premises of the offending person and cause the nuisance to be removed therefrom, and such person shall be liable for the costs incurred by the town for abatement in addition to being subject to prosecution for violating this chapter. 
The town manager may waive the costs for abatement of the nuisance when the owner of a single-family residential property lacks the ability or means to abate the nuisance. This exemption shall be determined by the town manager or his duly authorized agent. To qualify for this exemption, the median household income of the property owner must be less than eighty (80) percent of the most recent median household income for the country as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Single-family residential property owners requesting the exemption must submit proof of the household median income to the town within thirty (30) days of receiving the initial written notice. 
If the nuisance is determined to pose an immediate threat to public health and safety by the town manager or his duly authorized agent, then the town may take immediate protective measures to abate the nuisance and protect public health and safety.

It shall be unlawful for any person to in any manner hinder or obstruct any authorized officer or representative of the town, in the inspecting of any premises within the town limits, in the abatement or removal of any nuisance, or in the discharge of any of the duties prescribed in this chapter or any other ordinance for the prevention or correction of any unsanitary, unsightly, or unsafe condition in the town.

In the event of such refusal or neglect, the town manager may have removed or abated such nuisance, and all expense incurred in so abating or removing such nuisance shall be recoverable from the owner of the premises from which the nuisance shall be removed or abated, or from any person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, in the same manner as debts of like amounts are recoverable by law. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1, 4-21-09)  
Sec. 9-1-118. - Public nuisance abatement. 
(a)  Declaration of legislative findings. 
(1)  Repetitive violations of certain provisions of this Code by owners, property managers, occupants or tenants of individual parcels of property tend to cause a deterioration of the general health, safety, welfare and good order of the community at large. Such acts or omissions place an inordinate burden on public resources, including law enforcement and code enforcement. Repetitive violations are not efficiently resolved by normal law enforcement techniques. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, repetitive violations tending to cause a deterioration of the general health, safety, welfare and good order of the community at large shall include, but not be limited to, assaults, assault and battery, aggravated assaults of any type under the state code or common law, or other violations of a similar serious nature which tend to cause injury to a person, and disturbing the peace due to loud and excessive noise. 
(3)  It is the intent of this section to secure the cooperation and assistance of property owners and tenants in effecting a solution to the problems associated with repetitive violations of the Town Code and state criminal statutes, as described in paragraph (a)(2). The result of this effort will be to enhance the general welfare, health, safety, and good order of the community. 
(b)  Public nuisances declared. 
(1)  Any real property upon which its owners, property managers, tenants or occupants cause, permit, or maintain any activity that constitutes a violation, as described in paragraph (a)(2), which results in frequent calls for service by law enforcement officials during a relatively short period of time, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) herein, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
(2)  For the purposes of this section, three (3) or more calls for service to address separate violations, as described in paragraph (a)(2), within any six-month period, or four or more such violations within any twelve-month period, shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(3)  Whenever a public nuisance exists as described in this section, the town manager may send a written notice to the owner of the property, property manager, tenant, or occupant advising the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant that the property has been declared a public nuisance. Notice shall be presumed when the written notice is either personally served upon the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant or mailed to the last known address of the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant. The notice shall require the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant to take reasonable measures to promptly abate the nuisance. If within thirty (30) days after the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant have been given notice that the property is a nuisance the town manager is made aware that the nuisance has not been abated, the town manager may issue an order of abatement to the owner, property manager, tenant, or occupant and may suspend the business license of any business deemed by the town manager to be causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance. 
(4)  If within twelve (12) months after the owner or property manager of a property has been given notice that the property is a nuisance as provided in subsection (b)(3) above, another violation, as described in paragraph (a)(2), occurs on the property that necessitates a call for service by law enforcement officials, the town manager may issue an order of abatement to the owner or property manager and may suspend the business license of any business deemed by the town manager to be causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance. 
(5)  The order of abatement shall be in writing, shall state that the property constitutes a public nuisance, and shall require the owner or property manager to take reasonable measures designed to immediately abate the nuisance and to prevent a recurrence. Those measures may include, but are not limited to, making improvements to the property, removal of debris, installation of lighting to enhance security, hiring of security personnel, or the initiation and execution of eviction proceedings against the tenants or occupants who cause, permit, or maintain the violations. 
(6)  The order of abatement shall be served in the same manner as civil process upon the owner or property manager of the property. The order of abatement shall provide the owner or property manager a reasonable opportunity to meet with the town manager to discuss the allegations in the order of abatement and the need for abatement measures. The failure to implement the abatement measures specified in the order of abatement or subsequently agreed to within the 15 days following the date of the order of abatement, or within any other agreed period, shall constitute a violation of this Code, punishable as authorized by Section 1-5-10 of this Code. 
(7)  Property owners or business owners whose property or business is declared a public nuisance and issued an order of abatement issued pursuant to this chapter by the town manager may appeal to the town council by filing a written notice of appeal in the office of the town manager, such notice of appeal to be filed not later than ten (10) days following the service of the order of abatement. Appeals shall be scheduled for a hearing at town council within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice of appeal at a regular or special meeting of which the appellant has been given written notice. At the hearing all parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to present testimony and evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The proceedings shall be recorded and transcribed at the expense of the party so requesting. The rules of evidence and procedure for the hearing shall be prescribed by town council and shall govern the hearing. Town council shall by majority vote of members present render a decision, which shall be served upon all parties or their representatives. The decision shall be final unless appealed to the circuit court within ten (10) days after service. 
(8)  The procedures, penalties and remedies provided herein are in addition to and supplemental to the powers and procedures conferred by any other law or ordinance.

(3)  Gross income: Means the total gross receipts of a business, received or accrued, for one (1) calendar year collected or to be collected by a business. The term "gross receipts" means the value proceeding or accruing from the sale of tangible personal property, including merchandise and commodities of any kind and character and all receipts, by the reason of any business engaged in, including interest, dividends, discounts, rentals of real estate or royalties, without any deduction on account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or service cost, interest paid, or any other expenses whatsoever and without any deductions on account of losses, excepting therefrom gross income taxed in another county or municipality and fully reported to the county. The gross income, for business license purposes, shall conform to the gross income reported to the state tax commission or the state insurance commission.

ARTICLE 1. - FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE GENERAL STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 15-9-110. - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina does ordain as follows: 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-111. - Findings of fact. 
The special flood hazard areas of the Town of Hilton Head Island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruptions of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. 
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions of floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by structures vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-112. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that buildings vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such buildings, be protected against flood damages at the time of initial construction. 
(c)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(d)  Control filling, grading, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage or erosion. 
(e)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-113. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Hilton Head Island, SC. 
The flood hazard areas of the town have been identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the County of Beaufort," dated September 30, 1977, Federal Register Vol. 41, No. 207, pages 46,962—46,992, dated Tuesday, October 26, 1976, and subsequent supplement titled "Wave Height Analysis," dated June 4, 1984; with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary maps, dated September 30, 1977, and subsequent maps adding wave heights dated December 4, 1984, as reevaluated and effective September 29, 1986, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-114. - Establishment of land development application and building permit. 
The approval of a land development application shall be required in conformance with title 16 and the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. A building permit shall be required in conformance with title 15, title 16, and the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any construction activities. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-115. - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-116. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
If any part of this article is declared invalid, the remainder of the article shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-117. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town or on the part of any officer or employee of the town for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or that are attributable to any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-118. - Penalties for violation.

Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood elevation (BFE) means the computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. The BFE is the regulatory requirement for the elevation or floodproofing of structures. The relationship between the BFE and a structure's elevation determines the flood insurance premium. 
Building means any structure having two (2) or more exterior rigid walls and a roof supported by columns or walls and intended for the shelter, housing or enclosure of any person, commercial or business activity, process, equipment or goods. Each portion of a building separated from other portions by a firewall shall be considered as a separate building. 
Construction means the erection of any building or structure or any preparations (including land disturbing activities) for the same. 
Development means the use of a structure or land; or the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a structure; or an increase in land use intensity; or filling or excavating a parcel; or a change in effects or conditions of a site; or the alteration of a shore, bank or floodplain; or the construction or extension of a utility; or the subdivision of land. 
Enclosure means partially or fully walled areas below the lowest floor of an elevated building. 
Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 30, 1977. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters or from rain.

Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories MAY NOT be "Historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
Land development application means application for development and use of property as required by title 16 "Land Management Ordinance of the Town of Hilton Head Island," including, but not limited to, subdivision review (major and minor), development plan review (major or minor), small residential development review and utility project permit.

ARTICLE 4. - VARIANCES 
 
Sec. 15-9-411. - Requirements for variances. 
Upon the submission of a written application to the town construction board of adjustments and appeals, a variance may be granted permitting the new construction or substantial improvement of structures with a lowest floor elevation, lower than regulatory flood elevation if one (1) of the following are met: 
(a)  A historical structure upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(b)  Development necessary to conduct a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(c)  Wet floodproofing of an agricultural structure provided it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of section 15-9-312(f), this section, and the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.  Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment; 
b.  General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that are open on at least one (1) side; 
c.  For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of section 15-9-312(f) of this chapter. 
(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five (5) feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of section 15-9-312(f) of this chapter. 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation, plus any required freeboard, or be contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 15-3-311(d) of this chapter. 
(6)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain.

Sec. 15-9-412. - Required findings. 
If the proposed new construction or substantial improvement meets one (1) or more of the requirements in section 15-9-411, a variance may be granted if the town construction board of adjustment and appeals determines and expresses in writing all of the following findings: 
(a)  Good and sufficient cause exists for the granting of the variance. 
(b)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
(c)  The issuance of the variance would not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense. 
(d)  The variance would not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-413. - Hearing. 
(a)  All applications for variances shall be heard by the construction board of adjustments and appeals. 
(b)  Prior to the granting of a variance the construction board of adjustments and appeals must find that justifications exist in accordance with the terms of this chapter. These findings together with the granting of a variance, shall be reduced to writing, and may be a part of the public record. All variances shall pertain to the particular parcel of land and apply only to the proposed structure set forth in the variance and application. 
(c)  Such variance shall be freely transferable with the land and shall not be personal to the applicant. 
(d)  Unless otherwise provided therein, a variance shall be valid for a period of one (1) year after the date of its issuance. If construction has not commenced pursuant thereto within such time, said variance shall become void. Lapse of a variance by the passage of time shall not preclude subsequent application for variance. 
(e)  No variance except herein specifically permitted may be granted from the provisions of this chapter. The variance procedures herein provided shall be the exclusive method for obtaining variances under the provisions herein. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-414. - Fee. 
Each written application for a variance shall be accompanied by a fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00). Such application shall reflect the type of structures for which a variance is sought, the size of such structures, the approximate location upon the parcel and intended use thereof and the reasons for which the variance is being sought. 
( Ord. No. 2019-03 , § 1(Att. 1), 2-19-19)  
Sec. 15-9-415. - Notice of possible increased insurance cost. 
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given notice that the proposed structure will be located in the floodprone area. The structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest flood elevation below the regulatory flood elevation, and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced first floor elevation.

Sec. 17-4-113. - Definitions. 
The following definitions apply to the provisions of this chapter: 
A-weighted sound level. The sound pressure level in decibels (dB) as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting network. 
Alarm. Any device designed and intended to produce a sound signal as a method of providing a warning. 
Ambient noise. The total of all sound normally associated with a particular location or environmental surrounding. 
Chipping. The reduction of vegetative materials in size or volume into materials such as but not limited to mulch or chips. 
Daytime. That portion of each day beginning at 7:00 a.m. and ending at 10:00 p.m. 
Decibel, also dB. A unit for measuring the relative intensity of a sound, equal to twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measures to the reverence pressure, which is twenty (20) micropascals (twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter). In terms of human perception of continuous sound, a three (3) dB change is clearly perceptible, and a ten (10) dB change is perceived as a doubling or halving of loudness. 
Emergency vehicle. Any ambulance, rescue vehicle, fire truck or police vehicle operated by the police department, highway patrol, any authorized emergency rescue service or the fire department, when operated in the performance of their official duty. 
Emitter. Any person, group of persons, amplifier, horn, machine, animal, musical instrument, vehicle, radio, television, phonograph or any other thing which produces sound and the person having dominion, custody or control over any such thing. 
Excessively loud sound. Any sound which, in light of the surrounding circumstances, including the normal level of ambient noise, is unreasonably loud, or which would annoy or disturb a person of reasonable sensibilities. 
Frequency. One of the identifying characteristics of sound. The number of cycles per second imparted into the air by a vibrating body. 
Grinding. The reduction of vegetative materials in size or volume into materials such as but not limited to mulch or chips. 
Impulsive sound. Sound of short duration, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay, characterized by sound meter reading changes at a rate greater than ten (10) dBA within a five (5) second interval. 
Nighttime. That portion of each day beginning at 10:01 p.m. and ending at 6:59 a.m. 
Noise. Any excessively loud sound; any sound level in excess of the standards contained in this chapter; any sound which endangers, injures or interferes with the physical well-being or the safety of human beings or animals; or any sound which threatens to cause actual, physical harm to personal or real property, or which causes actual, physical harm to personal or real property. 
Sound. An oscillation in pressure, particle displacement, particle velocity or other physical parameter, in a medium with internal forces. "Sound" as defined herein may include any characteristic of sound, including, but not limited to, duration, pitch, frequency, intensity and loudness. 
Sound level. The weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a Type 1 or Type 2 sound level meter and frequency weighting network such as A, B or C as specified in the current American National Standards Institute specifications for sound level meters (currently: ANSI S1.4-1983). If the frequency weighting to be employed is not indicated in any provision hereof, the A-weighting shall apply. 
Sound level meter. An instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS detector, integrator or time averages, output meter and weighting network used to measure sound pressure levels. 
Sound pressure. The instantaneous difference between the actual pressure and the average or barometric pressure at a given point in space, as produced by sound energy. 
Sound pressure level. Twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the RMS sound pressure to the reference pressure of twenty (20) micropascals (20 × 10 -6 N/m 2 ). The sound pressure level is expressed in decibels.

Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2014 Land Management Ordinance. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is unchanged from the 2014 Land Management Ordinance. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in the Code of the Town of Hilton Head. Each section number consists of three parts separated by dashes. The first figure refers to the title number, the second figure refers to the chapter number and the third figure refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Katrina Hansen, Editor, and Dennis Sinnett, Supplement Department Vice President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Eileen Wilson, Senior Administrative Assistant, and the other members of the town staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Land Management Ordinance which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

a.   Required Findings
i.  A Variance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals if it concludes that the strict enforcement of any appropriate dimensional, development , design, or performance standard set forth in this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. A Variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board of Zoning Appeals determines and expresses in writing all of the following findings: 
01.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; 
02.  These conditions do not generally apply to other properties in the vicinity; 
03.  Because of these conditions, the application of this Ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and 
04.  The authorization of the Variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the zoning district where the property is located will not be harmed by the granting of the Variance. 
ii.  In its consideration of an application for a Variance, the decision-making body shall be guided by this Ordinance , the relevant provisions of the South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994, and the decisions of the appellate courts of South Carolina interpreting such provisions. 
b.   Limitations
The decision-making body may not grant a Variance, the effect of which would do any of the following: 
i.  Permit a use of land or a structure that is not allowed in the applicable zoning district; 
ii.  Allow the physical extension of a nonconforming use ; 
iii.  Increase the density of a use above that permitted by the applicable zoning district; or 
iv.  Vary the sign regulations. 
c.   Factor Not to be Considered
The fact that the property may be utilized more profitably, should a Variance be granted, may not be considered as grounds for a Variance. 
d.   Hardship Due to Eminent Domain
Where the alleged hardship results from the taking of part of the property of the applicant by eminent domain, thus reducing the land area available for parking, buffers and other purposes, the applicant shall have the burden of proving that, after good faith efforts by the applicant or the applicant's predecessor, the condemning authority failed or refused to provide the applicant compensation adequate to cover the value of both the land actually taken and the economic impacts of the reduction in the size of the remaining property. Only if the applicant meets such burden of proof will a hardship under these conditions be considered adequate to justify the granting of a Variance. 
5.   Effect of Approval
Approval of a Variance authorizes only the particular relief approved. It does not exempt the applicant from the responsibility to obtain all other approvals required by this Ordinance and any other applicable laws, and does not indicate that the development for which the Variance is granted should receive other permits or development approvals under this Ordinance unless the relevant and applicable portions of this Ordinance or any other applicable laws are met. Unless it expires in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.S.6, Expiration, a Variance, including any conditions of approval, shall run with the land , shall be binding on the landowners and their successors and assigns, and shall not be affected by a change in ownership. 
6.   Expiration
Granting of a Variance establishes a vested right in accordance with Sec. 16-2-102.J.1, Vested Rights for Approvals of Site Specific Development Plans.

If land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay district are not consistent with the standards in another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply unless the standards applicable in either of the overlay districts expressly provide that the district's standards shall prevail over those in other overlay districts. 
E.   Airport Overlay (A-O) District
1.   Purpose
The Airport Overlay (A-O) District is hereby established to ensure against safety hazards, noise, and obstruction problems associated with aircraft utilizing the Hilton Head Island Airport. All development proposed within the A-O District shall be subject to the standards specified in this section in addition to the standards and regulations contained in the particular base district in which the development occurs. 
2.   Applicability
Development in the A-O District is subject to regulation primarily to mitigate safety and noise problems. However, uses within the district also shall be regulated to ensure they are compatible with airport operations. The regulations governing use and height within the A-O District shall conform to the standards recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Advisory Circular, 150/5190-4A, "Model Zoning Ordinance to Limit Height of Objects Around Airports" (12-14-87). 
3.   Delineation of the District
a.   Mapping
The A-O District boundaries correspond with the Ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the FAA. The following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the A-O District. The A-O District and subdistricts are mapped as part of the Official Zoning Map . 
i.  Discretionary Noise Level 
This level of regulation corresponds to the Ldn 60 noise curve. It is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport. The areas to be regulated are subsections of the Discretionary Noise Level. 
ii.  Significant Noise Level 
The Ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the Ldn 60 noise curve. Due to its proximity to the airport's primary surface, greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required. 
iii.  Approach Path Subdistrict 
This Approach Path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions. It is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airport's primary surface, and extends to the Ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airport's primary surface. The airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5,000 feet long and 500 feet wide. The area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid, in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the FAA. The height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway. 
iv.  Inner Hazard Zone 
This Inner Hazard Zone is defined to include the runway protection zone, object free area, and obstacle free zone as determined by the FAA. All of the land within the Inner Hazard Zone lies on the Hilton Head Island Airport property. 
v.  Outer Hazard Zone 
Land within the Outer Hazard Zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
b.   Plat Notice
i.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District and is subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
ii.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the Outer Hazard Zone of the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Outer Hazard Zone of the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District." 
4.   Airport Overlay District Regulations
Geographically, the subdistricts of the A-O District overlap; however, development shall comply with all applicable regulations. Occupant loads referenced shall be based upon Table 1003.2.2.2, Maximum Floor Area Allowances Per Occupant, of the latest adopted edition of the IBC. For uses with fixed seating, minimum occupant load shall be calculated by dividing the net square footage by the number of seats. 
a.   Discretionary Noise Level District—Ldn 60
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance , no use may be made of land or water within the Ldn 60 noise level district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights (i.e., colors and patterns), result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Noise mitigation measures are encouraged for all proposed residential development . 
b.   Significant Noise Level—Ldn 65
Residential development is prohibited inside the Ldn 65 noise curve due to the severe nature of public health, safety, and welfare concerns. 
c.   Approach Path
Within the Approach Path subdistrict, no building , structure , utility pole or protrusion of any kind shall be permitted to extend to a height measured from the mean elevation of the airport runway that exceeds the limits established by the methodology described in this section. 
i.  The maximum height limits permitted under this Ordinance of 75 feet shall be lowered as necessary to correspond with the limits established as follows: 
01.  Along both sides and ends of the airport primary surface area, at the extremity of the primary surface, the height restriction shall be zero feet. Moving outward from both sides of the runway, 250 feet from the runway center line, the height limit shall increase at the rate of 1 foot upward per 7 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:7. 
02.  Moving outward from both ends of the runway primary surface area, the height limit shall increase at the rate of one foot upward per 34 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:34. From both ends of the primary surface area, the area subject to these special height limitations shall fan outward beyond the area that would be covered if the height limitation from the sides of the primary surface area extended beyond the ends of the runway. 
ii.  The following process has been established for tree pruning, topping, and removal on and off airport property to address the height limits in provision i above. For purposes of this section, "on airport property" shall be defined as any property in the approach path owned by Beaufort County and used for the operations of the Hilton Head Island Airport; "off airport property" shall be defined as that property affected by the height limits in the approach path. The requirements listed below are the only requirements in this Ordinance that the Hilton Head Island Airport must follow for tree pruning, topping and removal in the approach path. 
01.  On Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning, topping, and removal by parcel . The site plan shall identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan and to calculate any required fee for the tree replacement fund. 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal, the applicant shall flag all buffers and wetlands. 
(C)  In meeting the height requirements of provision i above, all adjacent use buffers and adjacent street buffers shall be a minimum of 75 feet in width. Additional buffers will also be required in the following areas: 
(1)  Between the 75-foot buffer and the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and between this wetland buffer and the 75-foot buffer near Beach City Road; and 
(2)  Between the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and the 1:34 approach slope line. 
(D)  All trees within the 1:34 slope, unless located within wetlands, wetland buffers or any buffers listed in provision (C) above may be removed. 
(E)  The Arborist will determine which trees within the 1:7 slope, wetlands or any buffers have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. For the purposes of this section, conifers are defined as cone-bearing trees with needle-like leaves, to include the cypresses as well as cone-bearing evergreens. Those trees that the Arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Those specimen trees and trees in any wetland buffer that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Variance. Those trees in any wetland that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect the understory vegetation. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
02.  Off Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , copies of all signed avigation easements or a copy of paperwork indicating that condemnation notices have been filed, and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning and removal by parcel . The site plan must identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an Arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan for each parcel . 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal the applicant shall flag all wetlands and wetland buffers . 
(C)  The Arborist shall determine which trees have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or within ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. Those trees that the arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect understory vegetation. 
(D)  Specimen trees and trees within wetland buffers , if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Variance. Trees within wetlands, if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
03.  Other Requirements 
(A)  Due to its significance to the Town, the 64-inch DBH Live Oak tree located adjacent to St. James Baptist Church in the Beach City Road right-of-way shall not be pruned or removed; instead, a light will be installed in the canopy of the tree to indicate the presence of this tree to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Should the FAA reject lighting this tree , the provisions of Sec. 16-3-106.E.4.c.ii shall apply. 
(B)  Due to their significance to the Town, the specimen Live Oak trees in the 1:34 and 1:7 slopes for the Hilton Head Island Airport shall only be pruned one foot out of the slope. 
(C)  The County and Town shall work together to jointly develop a plan to protect water quality consistent with storm water utility objectives. This plan shall include the planting of low growing native plants on the non-wetland, non-buffer portions of on airport property in the 1:34 slope. These plants help to maintain this area's ability to filter stormwater and biodegrade pollutants by maintaining the forest soils and their beneficial decomposers, keeping pore space in the soil to allow oxygen flow and providing suitable root systems as additional habitat for decomposers and to uptake pollutants. Examples of plants that can be used for these purposes are seaside juniper, native grasses, dwarf wax myrtle, saw palms, needle palms and some species of native blueberries. This plan shall be implemented by the County. 
(D)  All previous Hilton Head Island Airport projects related to non- development tree removal and mitigation on and off airport property must be completed prior to a permit being issued for additional tree removal. 
(E)  For both on airport and off airport property, the County and Town will work together to develop a landscape plan to meet mitigation requirements based on tree removal documented by the Arborist. The mitigation plan shall indicate dense plantings in all buffer areas; however, mitigation will be required throughout the affected parcels off airport property. The County shall present this landscape plan to the Town's Design Review Board for approval. Once the landscape plan is approved, the County shall implement the plan and pay into the tree replacement fund for tree mitigation not accomplished by replanting. 
d.   Inner Hazard Zone
All uses other than those that are airport runway related are prohibited from this area. 
e.   Outer Hazard Zone
i.  Special Construction Standards 
01.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of 100 square feet or more per occupant or structures designated as historical by the Town Council , no special construction standards shall apply. 
02.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of more than 20 square feet but less than 100 square feet per occupant, the following special construction standards shall apply: 
(A)  Noncombustible construction (IBC Type I, II, III or IV) is required. 
(B)  Fire protection sprinkler system is required. 
(C)  Minimum of two exits are required for each occupancy. 
(D)  Emergency lighting system is required. 
ii.  Prohibited Uses 
01.  Uses with a minimum occupant load of 20 square feet per occupant or less. 
02.  Uses designed to serve children or those with low effective mobility. Examples include, but are not limited to, day care centers, hospitals , assisted living facilities, and nursing homes . 
03.  Uses categorized as hazardous under the IBC. 
5.   Nonconforming Uses or Structures
a.   Regulations Not Retroactive
The regulations prescribed in this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any existing structure not conforming to the regulations as of July 21, 1998, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use . Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction , alteration, or intended use of any structure , the lawful construction or alteration of which was begun prior to July 21, 1998, and is diligently pursued. 
b.   Marking and Lighting
The owner of any existing nonconforming structure is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the Airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of Beaufort County. 
F.   Corridor Overlay (COR) District
1.   Purpose
a.  The purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect the aesthetic and visual character of lands on Hilton Head Island adjacent to the major streets , the waterfront, and the marshfront, as defined in this section. All development proposed within this Corridor Overlay (COR) District shall be subject to the procedures, standards and guidelines specified in the following paragraphs, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base district in which the development occurs. In particular, the purpose of the COR District is to: 
i.  Encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the Island's major streets , the beachfront, and the marshfront; 
ii.  Provide for the continued safe and efficient utilization of these streets ; and 
iii.  Provide for the continued preservation and conservation of the beachfront and marshfront. 
b.  This is accomplished through evaluation of development within the COR District by the Design Review Board (DRB), which is authorized to review the location, character, and appearance of new development and redevelopment. It is the purpose of such review to determine whether the proposed plan for development complies with the guidelines and other standards of this district. 
2.   Delineation of District
a.  The COR District shall include: 
i.  The rights-of-way and all parcels lying in whole or in part within 450 feet of each side of the rights-of-way of any street designated as a major or minor arterial in Sec. 16-5-105.B, Street Hierarchy; 
ii.  All parcels lying in whole or in part within 500 feet landward of the OCRM Base Line within the Town;

iv.  All parcels in the RD District, SPC District, and CR District. 
b.  The approximate boundary of this COR District shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map . 
c.  There shall be no alteration of the existing condition of land , uses , structures , landscaping, or lighting within the COR District, except in accordance with the requirements of this section and all other relevant provisions of this Ordinance . 
d.  All proposed new development and changes to existing development located in the COR District shall be reviewed by the DRB in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.I, Corridor Review (Minor and Major), and receive DRB approval before proceeding with development , unless exempted in accordance with subparagraph e below. 
e.  All public projects, with the exception of pathways, streets , and underground utilities, are subject to review by the Design Review Board . 
f.  If a proposed development will not be visible from the right-of-way of the associated arterial once the project is completed, the Official will review it through the Minor Corridor Review Procedure (Sec. 16-2-103.I.3). 
3.   Design Review Guidelines
The intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative architecture but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience. To accomplish this, the DRB shall utilize the Design Guide, in reviewing and making decisions on development . 
4.   Streetscape Improvement Guidelines
Streetscape improvements include those architectural or functional facilities or structures that occur on site but are not part of the building , and that encourage and facilitate human interaction with the environment. Examples include, but are not limited to, decorative light fixtures, fountains, sculpture, benches and tables, planters, retaining walls, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle parking structures , trash receptacles and enclosures, vendor areas, bollards and fences. These improvements shall be designed to be consistent with all guidelines of this section, and shall be reviewed for aesthetic functionality and compatibility with the Island character, as defined in the Hilton Head Island Design Guide. 
a.   Lighting
i.  Decorative, low-level intensity, non-concealed source lighting that defines vehicular or pedestrian ways may be acceptable if not used as general lighting for a development . 
ii.  All interior lighting shall be designed to prevent the light source or high levels of light from being visible from the corridor. 
iii.  Exterior architectural, display and decorative lighting visible from the corridor shall be generated from a concealed light source or low level light fixtures. With the exception of LED lighting, color lamps shall not be used. 
iv.  Site lighting shall conform to the provisions of Sec. 16-5-108, Site Lighting Standards. 
b.   Landscape Plans
Landscape plans for the proposed development shall provide visually harmonious and compatible settings for structures on the same lot and on adjoining or nearby lots and shall blend with the surrounding natural landscape. Natural appearing landscape forms are strongly encouraged; formal plans and the appearance of uninterrupted lines are discouraged. Landscaping may be required between buildings and sidewalks, parking lots and driveways . The scale of the proposed landscaping shall be in proportion to the building . 
c.   Signs
i.  New signs , replacement signs , or alterations to existing signs shall receive approval from the DRB (major signs ) or the Official (minor signs ), as provided in Sec. 16-5-114, Sign Standards, prior to installation. 
ii.  Signs will be reviewed for compliance with the guidelines of this section and for compatibility with the Island character. 
iii.  All signs shall meet all requirements of Sec. 16-5-114, Sign Standards. 
5.   Requirements Following Project Completion
a.  All appearance features, lighting, and landscaping shown on the application approved by the DRB shall be maintained by the landowner and all subsequent landowners . 
b.  Changes or damage to any appearance features, lighting, and landscaping shown on the application approved by the DRB that occur as a result of events or occurrences beyond the landowner's control shall be restored by the landowner to the condition that existed prior to the changes or damage. 
c.  Any changes to any appearance features, lighting, and landscaping shown on the application approved by the DRB that are proposed by the landowner shall require review and approval by the DRB in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.I, Corridor Review (Minor and Major). 
G.   Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District
1.   Purpose
This Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District is intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas. 
2.   Designation of District
A PD-2 Overlay District may be established in any base district other than the CON District using the provisions set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.D, Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. 
3.   Permitted Uses
Any use permitted by right , subject to use -specific conditions, or as a Special Exception in the underlying base district is permitted. Where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the PD-2, the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning district(s) . 
4.   Density and Development Standards
a.  A section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the site-specific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district , provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development. The average density for the PD-2 Overlay District shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district . 
b.  The standards for impervious cover and open space within a PD-2 Overlay District shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole, but do not have to be satisfied on a site -specific basis within individual phases of the planned development. 
c.  When a PD-2 Overlay District overlays more than one base zoning district , the area standards shall be pro-rated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule. 
d.  Where a specific site in a PD-2 Overlay District has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be long-term in nature (e.g., residential structures) and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved Master Plan, the Master Plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and, when applicable, the Master Plan cap, to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site . This provision shall not apply if a plan, survey, or other similar relevant document approved by the Town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the long-term use . This provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site through the approval of minor deviations from the approved Master Plan in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.D.8, Minor Deviations from Approved Master Plan. 
5.   PD-2 Listed Master Plans
The following PUDs are included in PD-2 Overlay Districts and their Town-approved Master Plans including associated text and any subsequent amendments are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Official Zoning Map and LMO text.

g.  Architectural guidelines and standards throughout the planned development. 
h.  Acreage sufficient to accomplish the basic purposes and features as outlined above. 
7.   Noncontiguous Planned Developments 
a.   General
As a means of enabling greater flexibility in the use of planned developments and promoting the Comprehensive Plan's land management goals, planned developments may be allowed on noncontiguous lands in several areas, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan . A noncontiguous planned development consists of two or more separate tracts of land that are not contiguous but are or upon approval, will be owned by the same legal entity. For purposes of this paragraph, tracts are not deemed noncontiguous solely because they are separated by a street , street right-of-way , or utility easement. 
b.   Additional Criteria for Noncontiguous Planned Development Master Plans
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph 6 above, the Master Plan for a noncontiguous planned development shall be designed expressly to provide creative utilization of separate lands to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: 
i.  To make better use of existing infrastructure; 
ii.  To establish and link amenities —including, but not limited to, open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and parking; 
iii.  To provide solutions to drainage, parking, redevelopment, or shoreline erosion problems; 
iv.  To allow protection in the Airport Overlay (A-O) District; and 
v.  To enable protection of significant historic, cultural, or natural resources. 
c.   Calculation and Transfer of Density and Area Requirements
i.  The overall density permitted within a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall be calculated by adding the densities allowed by right for the total acreage of all sites in the district and then averaging. 
ii.  Densities on the tract where development will occur cannot exceed 125 percent of the density allowed by the underlying base zoning district . 
iii.  Any tracts from which density is transferred to another tract within the PD-2 Overlay District shall not contain less than ½ acre of contiguous area, and the base zoning district containing land from which density is transferred shall be rezoned simultaneously to the Conservation District and subject to the Conservation District's development limitations. 
iv.  Applications for a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall include documents in a form suitable for recording that identify tracts proposed to be rezoned to the Conservation District and the tracts to which density is proposed to be transferred. The documents shall also summarize the restrictions of future development under Town regulations. The document shall be recorded as a condition of development plan approval and be in effect until the property is subsequently rezoned. 
H.   Forest Beach Neighborhood Character Overlay (FB-NC-O) District
1.   Applicability and Purpose
The purpose of the Forest Beach Neighborhood Character Overlay (FB-NC-O) District is to protect the single-family residential character of the district and in particular the development and redevelopment of lots within the district. All new development and changes to existing development in the district are subject to the overlay district regulations in addition to those listed in Sec. 16-3-104.C, Residential Single-Family-5 (RSF-5) District. 
2.   Approval
Compliance with the requirements of this section shall be determined by the Official at the time the building permit is reviewed and shall be based upon the standards of Sec. 16-3-104.C, Residential Single-Family-5 (RSF-5) District. 
3.   Delineation of District
The Forest Beach Neighborhood Character Overlay (FB-NC-O) District includes all parcels shown as hatched in Figure 16-3-106.H.3 below. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
 
 
4.   District Regulations
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
a.   Setbacks
i.  In addition to the single-family setback requirements of Sec. 16-5-102, Setback Standards, a side, and rear adjacent use setback shall be required. 
ii.  Setbacks shall comply with the standards of Sec. 16-5-102, Setback Standards, except that the 65 degree setback angle shall be measured from 20 feet above the required base flood elevation . 
iii.  Side adjacent use setbacks shall be 10 feet for lots with a width of 70 feet and above. For lot widths less than 70 feet, the side adjacent use setback shall be equal to 12 percent of the lot width rounded to the closest whole number. However, to preserve significant trees or stands of trees any one side setback may be reduced to five feet, provided the sum of the required side setbacks is not reduced. 
iv.  Rear adjacent use setbacks shall equal 10 percent of the lot depth or 10 feet, whichever is greater. However, to preserve significant trees or stands of trees , the rear setback may be reduced to five feet provided the sum of the required street and rear setbacks is not reduced. 
v.  To preserve significant trees or stands of trees in the rear of the lot, the street setback may be reduced to 15 feet provided the sum of the required street and rear setback is not reduced. 
b.   Buffers
i.  A 20-foot street buffer and side and rear buffers equal to the setbacks above shall be required. 
ii.  Buffers shall comply with the standards of Sec. 16-5-103, Buffer Standards,except that driveways for street access as permitted in Sec. 16-5-103.J, Development Within Required Buffers, shall be limited to a total of 24 feet wide within the buffer. 
(Revised 12-5-2017 - Ordinance 2017-19 ) 
iii.  If the cumulative size of existing trees in a buffer is less than two inches DBH per 100 square feet, supplemental tree planting shall be required. Supplemental trees shall be sized to achieve the two inches DBH per 100 square foot minimum in each buffer. 50 percent of the caliper inches of any supplemental trees shall be broad-leaved evergreen overstory hardwoods and endangered species as identified in Sec. 16-6-104.H. 
iv.  In the case of a corner lot , the required 20-foot adjacent street buffer may be reduced to 10 feet for the street with the lower ADT unless the street with the higher ADT is approved for the reduction in order to preserve significant trees or stands of trees . In the case where both streets have the same ADT, the 20-foot buffer shall apply to the street that will better preserve significant trees or stands of trees .

Sec.16-3-106.   Overlay Zoning Districts
A.   Purpose
Overlay zoning districts are superimposed over portions of one or more underlying base zoning districts or planned development districts with the intent of supplementing generally applicable development regulations with additional development regulations that address special area-specific conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and purposes of the underlying zoning district. 
B.   Establishment of Overlay Zoning Districts
Table 16-3-106.B, Overlay Zoning Districts Established, sets out the overlay zoning districts established by this Ordinance . Except where specifically provided in this Ordinance , variances from the overlay zoning district standards shall not be granted. 
TABLE 16-3-106.B: OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED 

DISTRICT NAME 
	ABBREVIATION

Coastal Protection Area Overlay District 	CPA -O 
Transition Area Overlay District 	TA-O 
 
C.   Classification of Overlay Zoning Districts
Land shall be classified or reclassified into an overlay zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.C, Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning). 
D.   Relationship Between Overlay and Base Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district . The standards governing the overlay zoning district shall control, whether they are more restrictive or less restrictive than a base zoning district . If land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay district are not consistent with the standards in another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply unless the standards applicable in either of the overlay districts expressly provide that the district's standards shall prevail over those in other overlay districts. 
E.   Airport Overlay (A-O) District
1.   Purpose
The Airport Overlay (A-O) District is hereby established to ensure against safety hazards, noise, and obstruction problems associated with aircraft utilizing the Hilton Head Island Airport. All development proposed within the A-O District shall be subject to the standards specified in this section in addition to the standards and regulations contained in the particular base district in which the development occurs. 
2.   Applicability
Development in the A-O District is subject to regulation primarily to mitigate safety and noise problems. However, uses within the district also shall be regulated to ensure they are compatible with airport operations. The regulations governing use and height within the A-O District shall conform to the standards recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Advisory Circular, 150/5190-4A, "Model Zoning Ordinance to Limit Height of Objects Around Airports" (12-14-87). 
3.   Delineation of the District
a.   Mapping
The A-O District boundaries correspond with the Ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the FAA. The following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the A-O District. The A-O District and subdistricts are mapped as part of the Official Zoning Map . 
i.  Discretionary Noise Level 
This level of regulation corresponds to the Ldn 60 noise curve. It is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport. The areas to be regulated are subsections of the Discretionary Noise Level. 
ii.  Significant Noise Level 
The Ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the Ldn 60 noise curve. Due to its proximity to the airport's primary surface, greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required. 
iii.  Approach Path Subdistrict 
This Approach Path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions. It is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airport's primary surface, and extends to the Ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airport's primary surface. The airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5,000 feet long and 500 feet wide. The area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid, in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the FAA. The height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway. 
iv.  Inner Hazard Zone 
This Inner Hazard Zone is defined to include the runway protection zone, object free area, and obstacle free zone as determined by the FAA. All of the land within the Inner Hazard Zone lies on the Hilton Head Island Airport property. 
v.  Outer Hazard Zone 
Land within the Outer Hazard Zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
b.   Plat Notice
i.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District and is subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
ii.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the Outer Hazard Zone of the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Outer Hazard Zone of the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District." 
4.   Airport Overlay District Regulations
Geographically, the subdistricts of the A-O District overlap; however, development shall comply with all applicable regulations. Occupant loads referenced shall be based upon Table 1003.2.2.2, Maximum Floor Area Allowances Per Occupant, of the latest adopted edition of the IBC. For uses with fixed seating, minimum occupant load shall be calculated by dividing the net square footage by the number of seats. 
a.   Discretionary Noise Level District—Ldn 60
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance , no use may be made of land or water within the Ldn 60 noise level district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights (i.e., colors and patterns), result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Noise mitigation measures are encouraged for all proposed residential development . 
b.   Significant Noise Level—Ldn 65
Residential development is prohibited inside the Ldn 65 noise curve due to the severe nature of public health, safety, and welfare concerns. 
c.   Approach Path
Within the Approach Path subdistrict, no building , structure , utility pole or protrusion of any kind shall be permitted to extend to a height measured from the mean elevation of the airport runway that exceeds the limits established by the methodology described in this section. 
i.  The maximum height limits permitted under this Ordinance of 75 feet shall be lowered as necessary to correspond with the limits established as follows: 
01.  Along both sides and ends of the airport primary surface area, at the extremity of the primary surface, the height restriction shall be zero feet. Moving outward from both sides of the runway, 250 feet from the runway center line, the height limit shall increase at the rate of 1 foot upward per 7 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:7. 
02.  Moving outward from both ends of the runway primary surface area, the height limit shall increase at the rate of one foot upward per 34 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:34. From both ends of the primary surface area, the area subject to these special height limitations shall fan outward beyond the area that would be covered if the height limitation from the sides of the primary surface area extended beyond the ends of the runway. 
ii.  The following process has been established for tree pruning, topping, and removal on and off airport property to address the height limits in provision i above. For purposes of this section, "on airport property" shall be defined as any property in the approach path owned by Beaufort County and used for the operations of the Hilton Head Island Airport; "off airport property" shall be defined as that property affected by the height limits in the approach path. The requirements listed below are the only requirements in this Ordinance that the Hilton Head Island Airport must follow for tree pruning, topping and removal in the approach path. 
01.  On Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning, topping, and removal by parcel . The site plan shall identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan and to calculate any required fee for the tree replacement fund. 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal, the applicant shall flag all buffers and wetlands. 
(C)  In meeting the height requirements of provision i above, all adjacent use buffers and adjacent street buffers shall be a minimum of 75 feet in width. Additional buffers will also be required in the following areas: 
(1)  Between the 75-foot buffer and the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and between this wetland buffer and the 75-foot buffer near Beach City Road; and 
(2)  Between the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and the 1:34 approach slope line. 
(D)  All trees within the 1:34 slope, unless located within wetlands, wetland buffers or any buffers listed in provision (C) above may be removed. 
(E)  The Arborist will determine which trees within the 1:7 slope, wetlands or any buffers have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. For the purposes of this section, conifers are defined as cone-bearing trees with needle-like leaves, to include the cypresses as well as cone-bearing evergreens. Those trees that the Arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Those specimen trees and trees in any wetland buffer that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Variance. Those trees in any wetland that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect the understory vegetation. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
02.  Off Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , copies of all signed avigation easements or a copy of paperwork indicating that condemnation notices have been filed, and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning and removal by parcel . The site plan must identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an Arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan for each parcel . 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal the applicant shall flag all wetlands and wetland buffers . 
(C)  The Arborist shall determine which trees have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or within ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. Those trees that the arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect understory vegetation. 
(D)  Specimen trees and trees within wetland buffers , if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Variance. Trees within wetlands, if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
03.  Other Requirements 
(A)  Due to its significance to the Town, the 64-inch DBH Live Oak tree located adjacent to St. James Baptist Church in the Beach City Road right-of-way shall not be pruned or removed; instead, a light will be installed in the canopy of the tree to indicate the presence of this tree to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Should the FAA reject lighting this tree , the provisions of Sec. 16-3-106.E.4.c.ii shall apply. 
(B)  Due to their significance to the Town, the specimen Live Oak trees in the 1:34 and 1:7 slopes for the Hilton Head Island Airport shall only be pruned one foot out of the slope. 
(C)  The County and Town shall work together to jointly develop a plan to protect water quality consistent with storm water utility objectives. This plan shall include the planting of low growing native plants on the non-wetland, non-buffer portions of on airport property in the 1:34 slope. These plants help to maintain this area's ability to filter stormwater and biodegrade pollutants by maintaining the forest soils and their beneficial decomposers, keeping pore space in the soil to allow oxygen flow and providing suitable root systems as additional habitat for decomposers and to uptake pollutants. Examples of plants that can be used for these purposes are seaside juniper, native grasses, dwarf wax myrtle, saw palms, needle palms and some species of native blueberries. This plan shall be implemented by the County. 
(D)  All previous Hilton Head Island Airport projects related to non- development tree removal and mitigation on and off airport property must be completed prior to a permit being issued for additional tree removal. 
(E)  For both on airport and off airport property, the County and Town will work together to develop a landscape plan to meet mitigation requirements based on tree removal documented by the Arborist. The mitigation plan shall indicate dense plantings in all buffer areas; however, mitigation will be required throughout the affected parcels off airport property. The County shall present this landscape plan to the Town's Design Review Board for approval. Once the landscape plan is approved, the County shall implement the plan and pay into the tree replacement fund for tree mitigation not accomplished by replanting. 
d.   Inner Hazard Zone
All uses other than those that are airport runway related are prohibited from this area. 
e.   Outer Hazard Zone
i.  Special Construction Standards 
01.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of 100 square feet or more per occupant or structures designated as historical by the Town Council , no special construction standards shall apply. 
02.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of more than 20 square feet but less than 100 square feet per occupant, the following special construction standards shall apply:

03.  Uses categorized as hazardous under the IBC. 
5.   Nonconforming Uses or Structures
a.   Regulations Not Retroactive
The regulations prescribed in this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any existing structure not conforming to the regulations as of July 21, 1998, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use . Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction , alteration, or intended use of any structure , the lawful construction or alteration of which was begun prior to July 21, 1998, and is diligently pursued. 
b.   Marking and Lighting
The owner of any existing nonconforming structure is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the Airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of Beaufort County. 
F.   Corridor Overlay (COR) District
1.   Purpose
a.  The purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect the aesthetic and visual character of lands on Hilton Head Island adjacent to the major streets , the waterfront, and the marshfront, as defined in this section. All development proposed within this Corridor Overlay (COR) District shall be subject to the procedures, standards and guidelines specified in the following paragraphs, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base district in which the development occurs. In particular, the purpose of the COR District is to: 
i.  Encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the Island's major streets , the beachfront, and the marshfront; 
ii.  Provide for the continued safe and efficient utilization of these streets ; and 
iii.  Provide for the continued preservation and conservation of the beachfront and marshfront. 
b.  This is accomplished through evaluation of development within the COR District by the Design Review Board (DRB), which is authorized to review the location, character, and appearance of new development and redevelopment. It is the purpose of such review to determine whether the proposed plan for development complies with the guidelines and other standards of this district. 
2.   Delineation of District

e.  All public projects, with the exception of pathways, streets , and underground utilities, are subject to review by the Design Review Board . 
f.  If a proposed development will not be visible from the right-of-way of the associated arterial once the project is completed, the Official will review it through the Minor Corridor Review Procedure (Sec. 16-2-103.I.3). 
3.   Design Review Guidelines
The intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative architecture but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience. To accomplish this, the DRB shall utilize the Design Guide, in reviewing and making decisions on development . 
4.   Streetscape Improvement Guidelines
Streetscape improvements include those architectural or functional facilities or structures that occur on site but are not part of the building , and that encourage and facilitate human interaction with the environment. Examples include, but are not limited to, decorative light fixtures, fountains, sculpture, benches and tables, planters, retaining walls, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle parking structures , trash receptacles and enclosures, vendor areas, bollards and fences. These improvements shall be designed to be consistent with all guidelines of this section, and shall be reviewed for aesthetic functionality and compatibility with the Island character, as defined in the Hilton Head Island Design Guide. 
a.   Lighting
i.  Decorative, low-level intensity, non-concealed source lighting that defines vehicular or pedestrian ways may be acceptable if not used as general lighting for a development . 
ii.  All interior lighting shall be designed to prevent the light source or high levels of light from being visible from the corridor. 
iii.  Exterior architectural, display and decorative lighting visible from the corridor shall be generated from a concealed light source or low level light fixtures. With the exception of LED lighting, color lamps shall not be used. 
iv.  Site lighting shall conform to the provisions of Sec. 16-5-108, Site Lighting Standards.

b.  Changes or damage to any appearance features, lighting, and landscaping shown on the application approved by the DRB that occur as a result of events or occurrences beyond the landowner's control shall be restored by the landowner to the condition that existed prior to the changes or damage. 
c.  Any changes to any appearance features, lighting, and landscaping shown on the application approved by the DRB that are proposed by the landowner shall require review and approval by the DRB in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.I, Corridor Review (Minor and Major). 
G.   Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District
1.   Purpose
This Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District is intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas. 
2.   Designation of District
A PD-2 Overlay District may be established in any base district other than the CON District using the provisions set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.D, Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. 
3.   Permitted Uses
Any use permitted by right , subject to use -specific conditions, or as a Special Exception in the underlying base district is permitted. Where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the PD-2, the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning district(s) . 
4.   Density and Development Standards
a.  A section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the site-specific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district , provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development. The average density for the PD-2 Overlay District shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district . 
b.  The standards for impervious cover and open space within a PD-2 Overlay District shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole, but do not have to be satisfied on a site -specific basis within individual phases of the planned development. 
c.  When a PD-2 Overlay District overlays more than one base zoning district , the area standards shall be pro-rated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule. 
d.  Where a specific site in a PD-2 Overlay District has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be long-term in nature (e.g., residential structures) and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved Master Plan, the Master Plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and, when applicable, the Master Plan cap, to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site . This provision shall not apply if a plan, survey, or other similar relevant document approved by the Town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the long-term use . This provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site through the approval of minor deviations from the approved Master Plan in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.D.8, Minor Deviations from Approved Master Plan. 
5.   PD-2 Listed Master Plans
The following PUDs are included in PD-2 Overlay Districts and their Town-approved Master Plans including associated text and any subsequent amendments are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Official Zoning Map and LMO text.

h.  Acreage sufficient to accomplish the basic purposes and features as outlined above. 
7.   Noncontiguous Planned Developments 
a.   General
As a means of enabling greater flexibility in the use of planned developments and promoting the Comprehensive Plan's land management goals, planned developments may be allowed on noncontiguous lands in several areas, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan . A noncontiguous planned development consists of two or more separate tracts of land that are not contiguous but are or upon approval, will be owned by the same legal entity. For purposes of this paragraph, tracts are not deemed noncontiguous solely because they are separated by a street , street right-of-way , or utility easement. 
b.   Additional Criteria for Noncontiguous Planned Development Master Plans
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph 6 above, the Master Plan for a noncontiguous planned development shall be designed expressly to provide creative utilization of separate lands to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: 
i.  To make better use of existing infrastructure; 
ii.  To establish and link amenities —including, but not limited to, open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and parking; 
iii.  To provide solutions to drainage, parking, redevelopment, or shoreline erosion problems; 
iv.  To allow protection in the Airport Overlay (A-O) District; and 
v.  To enable protection of significant historic, cultural, or natural resources. 
c.   Calculation and Transfer of Density and Area Requirements
i.  The overall density permitted within a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall be calculated by adding the densities allowed by right for the total acreage of all sites in the district and then averaging. 
ii.  Densities on the tract where development will occur cannot exceed 125 percent of the density allowed by the underlying base zoning district . 
iii.  Any tracts from which density is transferred to another tract within the PD-2 Overlay District shall not contain less than ½ acre of contiguous area, and the base zoning district containing land from which density is transferred shall be rezoned simultaneously to the Conservation District and subject to the Conservation District's development limitations. 
iv.  Applications for a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall include documents in a form suitable for recording that identify tracts proposed to be rezoned to the Conservation District and the tracts to which density is proposed to be transferred. The documents shall also summarize the restrictions of future development under Town regulations. The document shall be recorded as a condition of development plan approval and be in effect until the property is subsequently rezoned.

Sec.16-3-106.   Overlay Zoning Districts
A.   Purpose
Overlay zoning districts are superimposed over portions of one or more underlying base zoning districts or planned development districts with the intent of supplementing generally applicable development regulations with additional development regulations that address special area-specific conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and purposes of the underlying zoning district. 
B.   Establishment of Overlay Zoning Districts
Table 16-3-106.B, Overlay Zoning Districts Established, sets out the overlay zoning districts established by this Ordinance . Except where specifically provided in this Ordinance , variances from the overlay zoning district standards shall not be granted. 
TABLE 16-3-106.B: OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED 

DISTRICT NAME 
	ABBREVIATION 

Airport Overlay District 	A-O 
Corridor Overlay District 	COR 
Planned Development Overlay District 	PD-2 
Forest Beach Neighborhood Character Overlay District 	FB-NC-O 
Folly Field Neighborhood Character Overlay District 	FF-NC-O 
Holiday Homes Neighborhood Character Overlay District 	HH-NC-O 
Redevelopment Overlay District 	R-O 
Coastal Protection Area Overlay District 	CPA -O 
Transition Area Overlay District 	TA-O 
 
C.   Classification of Overlay Zoning Districts
Land shall be classified or reclassified into an overlay zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.C, Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning). 
D.   Relationship Between Overlay and Base Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district . The standards governing the overlay zoning district shall control, whether they are more restrictive or less restrictive than a base zoning district . If land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay district are not consistent with the standards in another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply unless the standards applicable in either of the overlay districts expressly provide that the district's standards shall prevail over those in other overlay districts. 
E.   Airport Overlay (A-O) District
1.   Purpose
The Airport Overlay (A-O) District is hereby established to ensure against safety hazards, noise, and obstruction problems associated with aircraft utilizing the Hilton Head Island Airport. All development proposed within the A-O District shall be subject to the standards specified in this section in addition to the standards and regulations contained in the particular base district in which the development occurs. 
2.   Applicability
Development in the A-O District is subject to regulation primarily to mitigate safety and noise problems. However, uses within the district also shall be regulated to ensure they are compatible with airport operations. The regulations governing use and height within the A-O District shall conform to the standards recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Advisory Circular, 150/5190-4A, "Model Zoning Ordinance to Limit Height of Objects Around Airports" (12-14-87). 
3.   Delineation of the District
a.   Mapping
The A-O District boundaries correspond with the Ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the FAA. The following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the A-O District. The A-O District and subdistricts are mapped as part of the Official Zoning Map . 
i.  Discretionary Noise Level 
This level of regulation corresponds to the Ldn 60 noise curve. It is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport. The areas to be regulated are subsections of the Discretionary Noise Level. 
ii.  Significant Noise Level 
The Ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the Ldn 60 noise curve. Due to its proximity to the airport's primary surface, greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required. 
iii.  Approach Path Subdistrict 
This Approach Path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions. It is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airport's primary surface, and extends to the Ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airport's primary surface. The airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5,000 feet long and 500 feet wide. The area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid, in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the FAA. The height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway. 
iv.  Inner Hazard Zone 
This Inner Hazard Zone is defined to include the runway protection zone, object free area, and obstacle free zone as determined by the FAA. All of the land within the Inner Hazard Zone lies on the Hilton Head Island Airport property. 
v.  Outer Hazard Zone 
Land within the Outer Hazard Zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
b.   Plat Notice
i.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District and is subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
ii.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the Outer Hazard Zone of the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Outer Hazard Zone of the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District." 
4.   Airport Overlay District Regulations
Geographically, the subdistricts of the A-O District overlap; however, development shall comply with all applicable regulations. Occupant loads referenced shall be based upon Table 1003.2.2.2, Maximum Floor Area Allowances Per Occupant, of the latest adopted edition of the IBC. For uses with fixed seating, minimum occupant load shall be calculated by dividing the net square footage by the number of seats. 
a.   Discretionary Noise Level District—Ldn 60
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance , no use may be made of land or water within the Ldn 60 noise level district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights (i.e., colors and patterns), result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Noise mitigation measures are encouraged for all proposed residential development . 
b.   Significant Noise Level—Ldn 65
Residential development is prohibited inside the Ldn 65 noise curve due to the severe nature of public health, safety, and welfare concerns. 
c.   Approach Path
Within the Approach Path subdistrict, no building , structure , utility pole or protrusion of any kind shall be permitted to extend to a height measured from the mean elevation of the airport runway that exceeds the limits established by the methodology described in this section. 
i.  The maximum height limits permitted under this Ordinance of 75 feet shall be lowered as necessary to correspond with the limits established as follows: 
01.  Along both sides and ends of the airport primary surface area, at the extremity of the primary surface, the height restriction shall be zero feet. Moving outward from both sides of the runway, 250 feet from the runway center line, the height limit shall increase at the rate of 1 foot upward per 7 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:7. 
02.  Moving outward from both ends of the runway primary surface area, the height limit shall increase at the rate of one foot upward per 34 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:34. From both ends of the primary surface area, the area subject to these special height limitations shall fan outward beyond the area that would be covered if the height limitation from the sides of the primary surface area extended beyond the ends of the runway. 
ii.  The following process has been established for tree pruning, topping, and removal on and off airport property to address the height limits in provision i above. For purposes of this section, "on airport property" shall be defined as any property in the approach path owned by Beaufort County and used for the operations of the Hilton Head Island Airport; "off airport property" shall be defined as that property affected by the height limits in the approach path. The requirements listed below are the only requirements in this Ordinance that the Hilton Head Island Airport must follow for tree pruning, topping and removal in the approach path. 
01.  On Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning, topping, and removal by parcel . The site plan shall identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan and to calculate any required fee for the tree replacement fund. 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal, the applicant shall flag all buffers and wetlands. 
(C)  In meeting the height requirements of provision i above, all adjacent use buffers and adjacent street buffers shall be a minimum of 75 feet in width. Additional buffers will also be required in the following areas: 
(1)  Between the 75-foot buffer and the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and between this wetland buffer and the 75-foot buffer near Beach City Road; and 
(2)  Between the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and the 1:34 approach slope line. 
(D)  All trees within the 1:34 slope, unless located within wetlands, wetland buffers or any buffers listed in provision (C) above may be removed. 
(E)  The Arborist will determine which trees within the 1:7 slope, wetlands or any buffers have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. For the purposes of this section, conifers are defined as cone-bearing trees with needle-like leaves, to include the cypresses as well as cone-bearing evergreens. Those trees that the Arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Those specimen trees and trees in any wetland buffer that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Variance. Those trees in any wetland that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect the understory vegetation. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
02.  Off Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , copies of all signed avigation easements or a copy of paperwork indicating that condemnation notices have been filed, and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning and removal by parcel . The site plan must identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an Arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan for each parcel . 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal the applicant shall flag all wetlands and wetland buffers . 
(C)  The Arborist shall determine which trees have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or within ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. Those trees that the arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect understory vegetation. 
(D)  Specimen trees and trees within wetland buffers , if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Variance. Trees within wetlands, if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
03.  Other Requirements 
(A)  Due to its significance to the Town, the 64-inch DBH Live Oak tree located adjacent to St. James Baptist Church in the Beach City Road right-of-way shall not be pruned or removed; instead, a light will be installed in the canopy of the tree to indicate the presence of this tree to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Should the FAA reject lighting this tree , the provisions of Sec. 16-3-106.E.4.c.ii shall apply. 
(B)  Due to their significance to the Town, the specimen Live Oak trees in the 1:34 and 1:7 slopes for the Hilton Head Island Airport shall only be pruned one foot out of the slope. 
(C)  The County and Town shall work together to jointly develop a plan to protect water quality consistent with storm water utility objectives. This plan shall include the planting of low growing native plants on the non-wetland, non-buffer portions of on airport property in the 1:34 slope. These plants help to maintain this area's ability to filter stormwater and biodegrade pollutants by maintaining the forest soils and their beneficial decomposers, keeping pore space in the soil to allow oxygen flow and providing suitable root systems as additional habitat for decomposers and to uptake pollutants. Examples of plants that can be used for these purposes are seaside juniper, native grasses, dwarf wax myrtle, saw palms, needle palms and some species of native blueberries. This plan shall be implemented by the County. 
(D)  All previous Hilton Head Island Airport projects related to non- development tree removal and mitigation on and off airport property must be completed prior to a permit being issued for additional tree removal. 
(E)  For both on airport and off airport property, the County and Town will work together to develop a landscape plan to meet mitigation requirements based on tree removal documented by the Arborist. The mitigation plan shall indicate dense plantings in all buffer areas; however, mitigation will be required throughout the affected parcels off airport property. The County shall present this landscape plan to the Town's Design Review Board for approval. Once the landscape plan is approved, the County shall implement the plan and pay into the tree replacement fund for tree mitigation not accomplished by replanting.

G.   Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District
1.   Purpose
This Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District is intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas. 
2.   Designation of District
A PD-2 Overlay District may be established in any base district other than the CON District using the provisions set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.D, Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. 
3.   Permitted Uses
Any use permitted by right , subject to use -specific conditions, or as a Special Exception in the underlying base district is permitted. Where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the PD-2, the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning district(s) . 
4.   Density and Development Standards
a.  A section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the site-specific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district , provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development. The average density for the PD-2 Overlay District shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district . 
b.  The standards for impervious cover and open space within a PD-2 Overlay District shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole, but do not have to be satisfied on a site -specific basis within individual phases of the planned development. 
c.  When a PD-2 Overlay District overlays more than one base zoning district , the area standards shall be pro-rated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule. 
d.  Where a specific site in a PD-2 Overlay District has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be long-term in nature (e.g., residential structures) and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved Master Plan, the Master Plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and, when applicable, the Master Plan cap, to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site . This provision shall not apply if a plan, survey, or other similar relevant document approved by the Town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the long-term use . This provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site through the approval of minor deviations from the approved Master Plan in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.D.8, Minor Deviations from Approved Master Plan. 
5.   PD-2 Listed Master Plans
The following PUDs are included in PD-2 Overlay Districts and their Town-approved Master Plans including associated text and any subsequent amendments are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Official Zoning Map and LMO text.

7.   Noncontiguous Planned Developments 
a.   General
As a means of enabling greater flexibility in the use of planned developments and promoting the Comprehensive Plan's land management goals, planned developments may be allowed on noncontiguous lands in several areas, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan . A noncontiguous planned development consists of two or more separate tracts of land that are not contiguous but are or upon approval, will be owned by the same legal entity. For purposes of this paragraph, tracts are not deemed noncontiguous solely because they are separated by a street , street right-of-way , or utility easement. 
b.   Additional Criteria for Noncontiguous Planned Development Master Plans
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph 6 above, the Master Plan for a noncontiguous planned development shall be designed expressly to provide creative utilization of separate lands to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: 
i.  To make better use of existing infrastructure; 
ii.  To establish and link amenities —including, but not limited to, open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and parking; 
iii.  To provide solutions to drainage, parking, redevelopment, or shoreline erosion problems; 
iv.  To allow protection in the Airport Overlay (A-O) District; and 
v.  To enable protection of significant historic, cultural, or natural resources. 
c.   Calculation and Transfer of Density and Area Requirements
i.  The overall density permitted within a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall be calculated by adding the densities allowed by right for the total acreage of all sites in the district and then averaging. 
ii.  Densities on the tract where development will occur cannot exceed 125 percent of the density allowed by the underlying base zoning district . 
iii.  Any tracts from which density is transferred to another tract within the PD-2 Overlay District shall not contain less than ½ acre of contiguous area, and the base zoning district containing land from which density is transferred shall be rezoned simultaneously to the Conservation District and subject to the Conservation District's development limitations. 
iv.  Applications for a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall include documents in a form suitable for recording that identify tracts proposed to be rezoned to the Conservation District and the tracts to which density is proposed to be transferred. The documents shall also summarize the restrictions of future development under Town regulations. The document shall be recorded as a condition of development plan approval and be in effect until the property is subsequently rezoned.

Sec.16-3-106.   Overlay Zoning Districts
A.   Purpose
Overlay zoning districts are superimposed over portions of one or more underlying base zoning districts or planned development districts with the intent of supplementing generally applicable development regulations with additional development regulations that address special area-specific conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and purposes of the underlying zoning district. 
B.   Establishment of Overlay Zoning Districts
Table 16-3-106.B, Overlay Zoning Districts Established, sets out the overlay zoning districts established by this Ordinance . Except where specifically provided in this Ordinance , variances from the overlay zoning district standards shall not be granted.

Holiday Homes Neighborhood Character Overlay District 	HH-NC-O 
Redevelopment Overlay District 	R-O 
Coastal Protection Area Overlay District 	CPA -O 
Transition Area Overlay District 	TA-O 
 
C.   Classification of Overlay Zoning Districts
Land shall be classified or reclassified into an overlay zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.C, Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning). 
D.   Relationship Between Overlay and Base Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district . The standards governing the overlay zoning district shall control, whether they are more restrictive or less restrictive than a base zoning district . If land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay district are not consistent with the standards in another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply unless the standards applicable in either of the overlay districts expressly provide that the district's standards shall prevail over those in other overlay districts. 
E.   Airport Overlay (A-O) District
1.   Purpose
The Airport Overlay (A-O) District is hereby established to ensure against safety hazards, noise, and obstruction problems associated with aircraft utilizing the Hilton Head Island Airport. All development proposed within the A-O District shall be subject to the standards specified in this section in addition to the standards and regulations contained in the particular base district in which the development occurs. 
2.   Applicability
Development in the A-O District is subject to regulation primarily to mitigate safety and noise problems. However, uses within the district also shall be regulated to ensure they are compatible with airport operations. The regulations governing use and height within the A-O District shall conform to the standards recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Advisory Circular, 150/5190-4A, "Model Zoning Ordinance to Limit Height of Objects Around Airports" (12-14-87). 
3.   Delineation of the District
a.   Mapping
The A-O District boundaries correspond with the Ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the FAA. The following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the A-O District. The A-O District and subdistricts are mapped as part of the Official Zoning Map . 
i.  Discretionary Noise Level 
This level of regulation corresponds to the Ldn 60 noise curve. It is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport. The areas to be regulated are subsections of the Discretionary Noise Level. 
ii.  Significant Noise Level 
The Ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the Ldn 60 noise curve. Due to its proximity to the airport's primary surface, greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required. 
iii.  Approach Path Subdistrict 
This Approach Path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions. It is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airport's primary surface, and extends to the Ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airport's primary surface. The airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5,000 feet long and 500 feet wide. The area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid, in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the FAA. The height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway. 
iv.  Inner Hazard Zone 
This Inner Hazard Zone is defined to include the runway protection zone, object free area, and obstacle free zone as determined by the FAA. All of the land within the Inner Hazard Zone lies on the Hilton Head Island Airport property. 
v.  Outer Hazard Zone 
Land within the Outer Hazard Zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
b.   Plat Notice
i.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District and is subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
ii.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the Outer Hazard Zone of the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Outer Hazard Zone of the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District." 
4.   Airport Overlay District Regulations
Geographically, the subdistricts of the A-O District overlap; however, development shall comply with all applicable regulations. Occupant loads referenced shall be based upon Table 1003.2.2.2, Maximum Floor Area Allowances Per Occupant, of the latest adopted edition of the IBC. For uses with fixed seating, minimum occupant load shall be calculated by dividing the net square footage by the number of seats. 
a.   Discretionary Noise Level District—Ldn 60
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance , no use may be made of land or water within the Ldn 60 noise level district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights (i.e., colors and patterns), result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Noise mitigation measures are encouraged for all proposed residential development . 
b.   Significant Noise Level—Ldn 65
Residential development is prohibited inside the Ldn 65 noise curve due to the severe nature of public health, safety, and welfare concerns. 
c.   Approach Path
Within the Approach Path subdistrict, no building , structure , utility pole or protrusion of any kind shall be permitted to extend to a height measured from the mean elevation of the airport runway that exceeds the limits established by the methodology described in this section. 
i.  The maximum height limits permitted under this Ordinance of 75 feet shall be lowered as necessary to correspond with the limits established as follows: 
01.  Along both sides and ends of the airport primary surface area, at the extremity of the primary surface, the height restriction shall be zero feet. Moving outward from both sides of the runway, 250 feet from the runway center line, the height limit shall increase at the rate of 1 foot upward per 7 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:7. 
02.  Moving outward from both ends of the runway primary surface area, the height limit shall increase at the rate of one foot upward per 34 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:34. From both ends of the primary surface area, the area subject to these special height limitations shall fan outward beyond the area that would be covered if the height limitation from the sides of the primary surface area extended beyond the ends of the runway. 
ii.  The following process has been established for tree pruning, topping, and removal on and off airport property to address the height limits in provision i above. For purposes of this section, "on airport property" shall be defined as any property in the approach path owned by Beaufort County and used for the operations of the Hilton Head Island Airport; "off airport property" shall be defined as that property affected by the height limits in the approach path. The requirements listed below are the only requirements in this Ordinance that the Hilton Head Island Airport must follow for tree pruning, topping and removal in the approach path. 
01.  On Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning, topping, and removal by parcel . The site plan shall identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan and to calculate any required fee for the tree replacement fund. 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal, the applicant shall flag all buffers and wetlands. 
(C)  In meeting the height requirements of provision i above, all adjacent use buffers and adjacent street buffers shall be a minimum of 75 feet in width. Additional buffers will also be required in the following areas: 
(1)  Between the 75-foot buffer and the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and between this wetland buffer and the 75-foot buffer near Beach City Road; and 
(2)  Between the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and the 1:34 approach slope line. 
(D)  All trees within the 1:34 slope, unless located within wetlands, wetland buffers or any buffers listed in provision (C) above may be removed. 
(E)  The Arborist will determine which trees within the 1:7 slope, wetlands or any buffers have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. For the purposes of this section, conifers are defined as cone-bearing trees with needle-like leaves, to include the cypresses as well as cone-bearing evergreens. Those trees that the Arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Those specimen trees and trees in any wetland buffer that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Variance. Those trees in any wetland that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect the understory vegetation. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
02.  Off Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , copies of all signed avigation easements or a copy of paperwork indicating that condemnation notices have been filed, and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning and removal by parcel . The site plan must identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an Arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan for each parcel . 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal the applicant shall flag all wetlands and wetland buffers . 
(C)  The Arborist shall determine which trees have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or within ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. Those trees that the arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect understory vegetation. 
(D)  Specimen trees and trees within wetland buffers , if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Variance. Trees within wetlands, if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
03.  Other Requirements 
(A)  Due to its significance to the Town, the 64-inch DBH Live Oak tree located adjacent to St. James Baptist Church in the Beach City Road right-of-way shall not be pruned or removed; instead, a light will be installed in the canopy of the tree to indicate the presence of this tree to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Should the FAA reject lighting this tree , the provisions of Sec. 16-3-106.E.4.c.ii shall apply. 
(B)  Due to their significance to the Town, the specimen Live Oak trees in the 1:34 and 1:7 slopes for the Hilton Head Island Airport shall only be pruned one foot out of the slope. 
(C)  The County and Town shall work together to jointly develop a plan to protect water quality consistent with storm water utility objectives. This plan shall include the planting of low growing native plants on the non-wetland, non-buffer portions of on airport property in the 1:34 slope. These plants help to maintain this area's ability to filter stormwater and biodegrade pollutants by maintaining the forest soils and their beneficial decomposers, keeping pore space in the soil to allow oxygen flow and providing suitable root systems as additional habitat for decomposers and to uptake pollutants. Examples of plants that can be used for these purposes are seaside juniper, native grasses, dwarf wax myrtle, saw palms, needle palms and some species of native blueberries. This plan shall be implemented by the County. 
(D)  All previous Hilton Head Island Airport projects related to non- development tree removal and mitigation on and off airport property must be completed prior to a permit being issued for additional tree removal. 
(E)  For both on airport and off airport property, the County and Town will work together to develop a landscape plan to meet mitigation requirements based on tree removal documented by the Arborist. The mitigation plan shall indicate dense plantings in all buffer areas; however, mitigation will be required throughout the affected parcels off airport property. The County shall present this landscape plan to the Town's Design Review Board for approval. Once the landscape plan is approved, the County shall implement the plan and pay into the tree replacement fund for tree mitigation not accomplished by replanting. 
d.   Inner Hazard Zone
All uses other than those that are airport runway related are prohibited from this area. 
e.   Outer Hazard Zone
i.  Special Construction Standards 
01.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of 100 square feet or more per occupant or structures designated as historical by the Town Council , no special construction standards shall apply. 
02.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of more than 20 square feet but less than 100 square feet per occupant, the following special construction standards shall apply: 
(A)  Noncombustible construction (IBC Type I, II, III or IV) is required.

F.   Corridor Overlay (COR) District
1.   Purpose
a.  The purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect the aesthetic and visual character of lands on Hilton Head Island adjacent to the major streets , the waterfront, and the marshfront, as defined in this section. All development proposed within this Corridor Overlay (COR) District shall be subject to the procedures, standards and guidelines specified in the following paragraphs, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base district in which the development occurs. In particular, the purpose of the COR District is to: 
i.  Encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the Island's major streets , the beachfront, and the marshfront; 
ii.  Provide for the continued safe and efficient utilization of these streets ; and 
iii.  Provide for the continued preservation and conservation of the beachfront and marshfront. 
b.  This is accomplished through evaluation of development within the COR District by the Design Review Board (DRB), which is authorized to review the location, character, and appearance of new development and redevelopment. It is the purpose of such review to determine whether the proposed plan for development complies with the guidelines and other standards of this district. 
2.   Delineation of District

G.   Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District
1.   Purpose
This Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District is intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas. 
2.   Designation of District
A PD-2 Overlay District may be established in any base district other than the CON District using the provisions set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.D, Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. 
3.   Permitted Uses
Any use permitted by right , subject to use -specific conditions, or as a Special Exception in the underlying base district is permitted. Where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the PD-2, the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning district(s) . 
4.   Density and Development Standards
a.  A section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the site-specific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district , provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development. The average density for the PD-2 Overlay District shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district . 
b.  The standards for impervious cover and open space within a PD-2 Overlay District shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole, but do not have to be satisfied on a site -specific basis within individual phases of the planned development. 
c.  When a PD-2 Overlay District overlays more than one base zoning district , the area standards shall be pro-rated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule. 
d.  Where a specific site in a PD-2 Overlay District has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be long-term in nature (e.g., residential structures) and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved Master Plan, the Master Plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and, when applicable, the Master Plan cap, to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site . This provision shall not apply if a plan, survey, or other similar relevant document approved by the Town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the long-term use . This provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site through the approval of minor deviations from the approved Master Plan in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.D.8, Minor Deviations from Approved Master Plan. 
5.   PD-2 Listed Master Plans
The following PUDs are included in PD-2 Overlay Districts and their Town-approved Master Plans including associated text and any subsequent amendments are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Official Zoning Map and LMO text.

7.   Noncontiguous Planned Developments 
a.   General
As a means of enabling greater flexibility in the use of planned developments and promoting the Comprehensive Plan's land management goals, planned developments may be allowed on noncontiguous lands in several areas, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan . A noncontiguous planned development consists of two or more separate tracts of land that are not contiguous but are or upon approval, will be owned by the same legal entity. For purposes of this paragraph, tracts are not deemed noncontiguous solely because they are separated by a street , street right-of-way , or utility easement. 
b.   Additional Criteria for Noncontiguous Planned Development Master Plans
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph 6 above, the Master Plan for a noncontiguous planned development shall be designed expressly to provide creative utilization of separate lands to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: 
i.  To make better use of existing infrastructure; 
ii.  To establish and link amenities —including, but not limited to, open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and parking; 
iii.  To provide solutions to drainage, parking, redevelopment, or shoreline erosion problems; 
iv.  To allow protection in the Airport Overlay (A-O) District; and 
v.  To enable protection of significant historic, cultural, or natural resources. 
c.   Calculation and Transfer of Density and Area Requirements
i.  The overall density permitted within a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall be calculated by adding the densities allowed by right for the total acreage of all sites in the district and then averaging. 
ii.  Densities on the tract where development will occur cannot exceed 125 percent of the density allowed by the underlying base zoning district . 
iii.  Any tracts from which density is transferred to another tract within the PD-2 Overlay District shall not contain less than ½ acre of contiguous area, and the base zoning district containing land from which density is transferred shall be rezoned simultaneously to the Conservation District and subject to the Conservation District's development limitations. 
iv.  Applications for a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall include documents in a form suitable for recording that identify tracts proposed to be rezoned to the Conservation District and the tracts to which density is proposed to be transferred. The documents shall also summarize the restrictions of future development under Town regulations. The document shall be recorded as a condition of development plan approval and be in effect until the property is subsequently rezoned.

Maximum adjacent street setback angles (see Sec. 16-5-102.C) and adjacent use setback angles (see Sec. 16-5-102.D) 	May be increased based on the height of the structure and setback distance, but may not exceed a 75 degree angle. 
Minimum open space requirement (see Sec. 16-5-104) 	Shall not exceed minimum requirements of the base district, except for open space that exists as a legal nonconforming site feature , which may be maintained. In no case shall an application for rezoning to the R-O district be approved for a site where open space is less than 20% of the site. 
Minimum number of parking spaces (see Sec. 16-5-107.D.1) 	Up to 50% reduction, if it is demonstrated off-street parking can be adequately addressed. 
Parallel parking spaces (see Sec. 16-5-107.D.7) 	The number of parallel parking spaces may be increased. 
Compact parking spaces (see Sec. 16-5-107.D.8) 	Compact parking spaces may be maintained up to the number that existed on the site as a nonconforming site feature prior to redevelopment. 
Parking space dimensions (see Sec. 16-5-107.E.1) 	Regular parking spaces that are no less than 8.5 feet by 18 feet, or compact spaces that are no less than 8.5 feet by 15 feet may be reconstructed to the same size that existed as a legal nonconforming site feature prior to the proposed redevelopment. 
	Width of parking spaces adjoining a median at the end of a row of parking may be reduced to nine feet, or what existed on the site before redevelopment if the parking space dimensions at the time were a legal nonconforming site feature . 
Maximum number of parking spaces between landscaped medians along a row of parking (see Sec. 16-5-107.G.3.a.iv) 	May be increased by up to three spaces if it is demonstrated that the parking lot contains sufficient landscaping to mitigate its environmental and visual impacts to an equivalent degree. 
Minimum width of landscaped medians in parking lots (see Sec. 16-5-107.G.3.b) 	May be reduced by up to 20% if it is demonstrated that the parking lot contains sufficient landscaping to mitigate its environmental and visual impacts to an equivalent degree. 
Maximum off-site parking spaces (see Sec. 16-5-107.H.4.a) 	Up to 20% of required parking spaces may be provided off-site , if it is demonstrated that safe and convenient vehicular access is provided to the development served by the off-site parking. 
Pedestrian access to shared parking (see Sec. 16-5-107.H.3.b) and off-site parking (see Sec. 16-5-107.H.4.c) 	Access to shared or off-site parking may cross an arterial street if it is determined there is adequate and safe pedestrian ingress and egress to the development served by the off-premise parking. 
On-street parking (see Sec. 16-5-107.H.6) 	May be used to satisfy up to 100% of the number of parking spaces required. 
Minimum tree coverage (see Sec. 16-6-104.G) 	A legal nonconforming site that does not comply with the minimum tree coverage requirement may be allowed to redevelop without the minimum amount of tree coverage if it is determined all feasible and practical alternative steps have been taken to meet the required amount of tree coverage on the site, and the landowner deposits a tree mitigation fee in a Town-administered tree replacement fund in-lieu of providing additional tree canopy. (see Sec. 16-6-104.L). 
 
7.   Minor Amendment

D.   Relationship Between Overlay and Base Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district . The standards governing the overlay zoning district shall control, whether they are more restrictive or less restrictive than a base zoning district . If land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay district are not consistent with the standards in another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply unless the standards applicable in either of the overlay districts expressly provide that the district's standards shall prevail over those in other overlay districts. 
E.   Airport Overlay (A-O) District
1.   Purpose
The Airport Overlay (A-O) District is hereby established to ensure against safety hazards, noise, and obstruction problems associated with aircraft utilizing the Hilton Head Island Airport. All development proposed within the A-O District shall be subject to the standards specified in this section in addition to the standards and regulations contained in the particular base district in which the development occurs. 
2.   Applicability
Development in the A-O District is subject to regulation primarily to mitigate safety and noise problems. However, uses within the district also shall be regulated to ensure they are compatible with airport operations. The regulations governing use and height within the A-O District shall conform to the standards recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Advisory Circular, 150/5190-4A, "Model Zoning Ordinance to Limit Height of Objects Around Airports" (12-14-87). 
3.   Delineation of the District
a.   Mapping
The A-O District boundaries correspond with the Ldn 60 noise curve in accordance with planning standards of the FAA. The following five subdistricts of regulation are delineated within the A-O District. The A-O District and subdistricts are mapped as part of the Official Zoning Map . 
i.  Discretionary Noise Level 
This level of regulation corresponds to the Ldn 60 noise curve. It is considered discretionary because it is the transitional impact level between significant and insignificant noise levels in the vicinity of the airport. The areas to be regulated are subsections of the Discretionary Noise Level. 
ii.  Significant Noise Level 
The Ldn 65 noise curve is concentrically placed inside the Ldn 60 noise curve. Due to its proximity to the airport's primary surface, greater noise and safety concerns exist and more restrictive regulation is required. 
iii.  Approach Path Subdistrict 
This Approach Path subdistrict is established to ensure that development near the airstrip will not pose safety problems due to vertical protrusions. It is the area that extends 525 feet on both sides of the airport's primary surface, and extends to the Ldn 60 noise curve at each end of the airport's primary surface. The airport runway primary surface area consists of a rectangle that is 5,000 feet long and 500 feet wide. The area encompassed by these special height limitations at the ends of the runway is in the shape of a trapezoid, in which the smaller and larger bases are established by the FAA. The height of the trapezoid would be the linear distance from the end of the runway. 
iv.  Inner Hazard Zone 
This Inner Hazard Zone is defined to include the runway protection zone, object free area, and obstacle free zone as determined by the FAA. All of the land within the Inner Hazard Zone lies on the Hilton Head Island Airport property. 
v.  Outer Hazard Zone 
Land within the Outer Hazard Zone is identified as the area that demonstrates a higher statistical probability of aircraft accidents occurring as determined by methods developed by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
b.   Plat Notice
i.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District and is subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
ii.  A notice shall be placed on all plats for properties located within the Outer Hazard Zone of the A-O District that states as follows: "This property lies either partially or wholly within the Outer Hazard Zone of the Hilton Head Island Airport Overlay District." 
4.   Airport Overlay District Regulations
Geographically, the subdistricts of the A-O District overlap; however, development shall comply with all applicable regulations. Occupant loads referenced shall be based upon Table 1003.2.2.2, Maximum Floor Area Allowances Per Occupant, of the latest adopted edition of the IBC. For uses with fixed seating, minimum occupant load shall be calculated by dividing the net square footage by the number of seats. 
a.   Discretionary Noise Level District—Ldn 60
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance , no use may be made of land or water within the Ldn 60 noise level district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights (i.e., colors and patterns), result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Noise mitigation measures are encouraged for all proposed residential development . 
b.   Significant Noise Level—Ldn 65
Residential development is prohibited inside the Ldn 65 noise curve due to the severe nature of public health, safety, and welfare concerns. 
c.   Approach Path
Within the Approach Path subdistrict, no building , structure , utility pole or protrusion of any kind shall be permitted to extend to a height measured from the mean elevation of the airport runway that exceeds the limits established by the methodology described in this section. 
i.  The maximum height limits permitted under this Ordinance of 75 feet shall be lowered as necessary to correspond with the limits established as follows: 
01.  Along both sides and ends of the airport primary surface area, at the extremity of the primary surface, the height restriction shall be zero feet. Moving outward from both sides of the runway, 250 feet from the runway center line, the height limit shall increase at the rate of 1 foot upward per 7 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:7. 
02.  Moving outward from both ends of the runway primary surface area, the height limit shall increase at the rate of one foot upward per 34 linear feet, or a ratio of 1:34. From both ends of the primary surface area, the area subject to these special height limitations shall fan outward beyond the area that would be covered if the height limitation from the sides of the primary surface area extended beyond the ends of the runway. 
ii.  The following process has been established for tree pruning, topping, and removal on and off airport property to address the height limits in provision i above. For purposes of this section, "on airport property" shall be defined as any property in the approach path owned by Beaufort County and used for the operations of the Hilton Head Island Airport; "off airport property" shall be defined as that property affected by the height limits in the approach path. The requirements listed below are the only requirements in this Ordinance that the Hilton Head Island Airport must follow for tree pruning, topping and removal in the approach path. 
01.  On Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning, topping, and removal by parcel . The site plan shall identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan and to calculate any required fee for the tree replacement fund. 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal, the applicant shall flag all buffers and wetlands. 
(C)  In meeting the height requirements of provision i above, all adjacent use buffers and adjacent street buffers shall be a minimum of 75 feet in width. Additional buffers will also be required in the following areas: 
(1)  Between the 75-foot buffer and the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and between this wetland buffer and the 75-foot buffer near Beach City Road; and 
(2)  Between the wetland buffer related to the wetland on airport property in closest proximity to St. James Baptist Church and the 1:34 approach slope line. 
(D)  All trees within the 1:34 slope, unless located within wetlands, wetland buffers or any buffers listed in provision (C) above may be removed. 
(E)  The Arborist will determine which trees within the 1:7 slope, wetlands or any buffers have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. For the purposes of this section, conifers are defined as cone-bearing trees with needle-like leaves, to include the cypresses as well as cone-bearing evergreens. Those trees that the Arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Those specimen trees and trees in any wetland buffer that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Variance. Those trees in any wetland that cannot be pruned may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect the understory vegetation. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
02.  Off Airport Property 
(A)  Applicants for a Natural Resources Permit (see Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit) need only submit an application form, a brief narrative of proposed plans for tree protection and replacement, a site plan , copies of all signed avigation easements or a copy of paperwork indicating that condemnation notices have been filed, and copies of all required permits from other agencies. The applicant may phase the tree pruning and removal by parcel . The site plan must identify the parcels where trees will be pruned or removed and delineate any wetlands and wetland buffers within the subject parcels . Additionally, the Town and Beaufort County will jointly fund and employ an Arborist to document the size and species of each removed tree by parcel . This data will be used to prepare a mitigation plan for each parcel . 
(B)  Prior to any tree pruning or removal the applicant shall flag all wetlands and wetland buffers . 
(C)  The Arborist shall determine which trees have exceeded or have the potential to exceed the height requirements in provision i above within five years [hardwoods] of the approval date or within ten years [conifers] of the approval date based on the species and maturity of each tree ; the Arborist will then identify which of these trees can be pruned to be out of the approach path and to the five or ten year growth potential, respectively. Those trees that the arborist determines require such severe pruning that they can no longer support themselves may be removed. Reasonable care shall be taken to protect understory vegetation. 
(D)  Specimen trees and trees within wetland buffers , if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Variance. Trees within wetlands, if required to be removed based on the above subparagraph, may be removed without a Wetland Alteration Permit. Mechanized vehicles shall not be used in wetlands or any buffers. 
03.  Other Requirements 
(A)  Due to its significance to the Town, the 64-inch DBH Live Oak tree located adjacent to St. James Baptist Church in the Beach City Road right-of-way shall not be pruned or removed; instead, a light will be installed in the canopy of the tree to indicate the presence of this tree to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Should the FAA reject lighting this tree , the provisions of Sec. 16-3-106.E.4.c.ii shall apply. 
(B)  Due to their significance to the Town, the specimen Live Oak trees in the 1:34 and 1:7 slopes for the Hilton Head Island Airport shall only be pruned one foot out of the slope. 
(C)  The County and Town shall work together to jointly develop a plan to protect water quality consistent with storm water utility objectives. This plan shall include the planting of low growing native plants on the non-wetland, non-buffer portions of on airport property in the 1:34 slope. These plants help to maintain this area's ability to filter stormwater and biodegrade pollutants by maintaining the forest soils and their beneficial decomposers, keeping pore space in the soil to allow oxygen flow and providing suitable root systems as additional habitat for decomposers and to uptake pollutants. Examples of plants that can be used for these purposes are seaside juniper, native grasses, dwarf wax myrtle, saw palms, needle palms and some species of native blueberries. This plan shall be implemented by the County. 
(D)  All previous Hilton Head Island Airport projects related to non- development tree removal and mitigation on and off airport property must be completed prior to a permit being issued for additional tree removal. 
(E)  For both on airport and off airport property, the County and Town will work together to develop a landscape plan to meet mitigation requirements based on tree removal documented by the Arborist. The mitigation plan shall indicate dense plantings in all buffer areas; however, mitigation will be required throughout the affected parcels off airport property. The County shall present this landscape plan to the Town's Design Review Board for approval. Once the landscape plan is approved, the County shall implement the plan and pay into the tree replacement fund for tree mitigation not accomplished by replanting. 
d.   Inner Hazard Zone
All uses other than those that are airport runway related are prohibited from this area. 
e.   Outer Hazard Zone
i.  Special Construction Standards 
01.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of 100 square feet or more per occupant or structures designated as historical by the Town Council , no special construction standards shall apply. 
02.  For uses with minimum occupant loads of more than 20 square feet but less than 100 square feet per occupant, the following special construction standards shall apply: 
(A)  Noncombustible construction (IBC Type I, II, III or IV) is required. 
(B)  Fire protection sprinkler system is required.

G.   Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District
1.   Purpose
This Planned Development Overlay (PD-2) District is intended to encourage creativity in design and planning in the development of parcels between five and 249 acres by allowing greater design flexibility than the underlying base zoning district so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less environmentally sensitive areas. 
2.   Designation of District
A PD-2 Overlay District may be established in any base district other than the CON District using the provisions set forth in Sec. 16-2-103.D, Planned Unit Development (PUD) District. 
3.   Permitted Uses
Any use permitted by right , subject to use -specific conditions, or as a Special Exception in the underlying base district is permitted. Where multiple base zoning districts are incorporated in the PD-2, the uses shall remain proportional to the area of the underlying base zoning district(s) . 
4.   Density and Development Standards
a.  A section or phase of the planned development may be built at a density which is greater than the site-specific density allowed by the underlying base zoning district , provided that any such concentration of density is offset by an area of lower density in another section or phase of the planned development or by an appropriate reservation of common open space elsewhere in the planned development. The average density for the PD-2 Overlay District shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base zoning district . 
b.  The standards for impervious cover and open space within a PD-2 Overlay District shall be fully satisfied for the district as a whole, but do not have to be satisfied on a site -specific basis within individual phases of the planned development. 
c.  When a PD-2 Overlay District overlays more than one base zoning district , the area standards shall be pro-rated based on the district acreage and the average resulting standard shall rule. 
d.  Where a specific site in a PD-2 Overlay District has been developed for a use that can reasonably be considered to be long-term in nature (e.g., residential structures) and the resulting density of the use is less than the maximum density allowed for the specific site by the approved Master Plan, the Master Plan shall be deemed to be automatically amended for both the site and, when applicable, the Master Plan cap, to reflect the lesser density actually developed on the specific site . This provision shall not apply if a plan, survey, or other similar relevant document approved by the Town indicates that additional development is still contemplated for the specific site after completion of development of the long-term use . This provision shall not necessarily preclude the transfer of specified density from one undeveloped site to another undeveloped site through the approval of minor deviations from the approved Master Plan in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.D.8, Minor Deviations from Approved Master Plan. 
5.   PD-2 Listed Master Plans
The following PUDs are included in PD-2 Overlay Districts and their Town-approved Master Plans including associated text and any subsequent amendments are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Official Zoning Map and LMO text.

a.   General
As a means of enabling greater flexibility in the use of planned developments and promoting the Comprehensive Plan's land management goals, planned developments may be allowed on noncontiguous lands in several areas, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan . A noncontiguous planned development consists of two or more separate tracts of land that are not contiguous but are or upon approval, will be owned by the same legal entity. For purposes of this paragraph, tracts are not deemed noncontiguous solely because they are separated by a street , street right-of-way , or utility easement. 
b.   Additional Criteria for Noncontiguous Planned Development Master Plans
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph 6 above, the Master Plan for a noncontiguous planned development shall be designed expressly to provide creative utilization of separate lands to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: 
i.  To make better use of existing infrastructure; 
ii.  To establish and link amenities —including, but not limited to, open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and parking; 
iii.  To provide solutions to drainage, parking, redevelopment, or shoreline erosion problems; 
iv.  To allow protection in the Airport Overlay (A-O) District; and 
v.  To enable protection of significant historic, cultural, or natural resources. 
c.   Calculation and Transfer of Density and Area Requirements
i.  The overall density permitted within a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall be calculated by adding the densities allowed by right for the total acreage of all sites in the district and then averaging. 
ii.  Densities on the tract where development will occur cannot exceed 125 percent of the density allowed by the underlying base zoning district . 
iii.  Any tracts from which density is transferred to another tract within the PD-2 Overlay District shall not contain less than ½ acre of contiguous area, and the base zoning district containing land from which density is transferred shall be rezoned simultaneously to the Conservation District and subject to the Conservation District's development limitations. 
iv.  Applications for a noncontiguous PD-2 Overlay District shall include documents in a form suitable for recording that identify tracts proposed to be rezoned to the Conservation District and the tracts to which density is proposed to be transferred. The documents shall also summarize the restrictions of future development under Town regulations. The document shall be recorded as a condition of development plan approval and be in effect until the property is subsequently rezoned.

Chapter 16-4: - Use Standards 
 
Sec.16-4-101. - Organization 
A.  Section 16-4-102, Principal Uses, sets out the uses allowed as principal uses in the zoning districts, what type of permit or review is required to establish them, and any special conditions applicable to particular principal uses . 
B.  Section 16-4-103, Accessory Uses and Structures, identifies the uses and structures commonly allowed as accessory to principal uses and sets out where they are allowed, what type of permit or review is required to establish them, general standards applicable to all accessory uses and structures , and any special conditions applicable to particular accessory uses and structures . 
C.  Section 16-4-104, Temporary Uses and Structures, sets out which uses or structures are allowed on a temporary basis, and the general standards applicable to all temporary uses and structures , and any special conditions applicable to particular temporary uses and structures .  
Sec.16-4-102. - Principal Uses 
A.   Principal Use Table
1.   Structure of Principal Use Table
a.   Organization and Classification of Principal Uses
i.  The Principal Use Table organizes allowable principal uses with the following hierarchy of classifications: 
01.  Use Classifications are relatively broad and general and represent major groups of use types that have common functional or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, type of occupants or users/customers, or operational characteristics. 
02.  Use Types are a mix of relatively broad uses and specific uses within the various use classifications. They represent uses that this Ordinance treats differently in terms of where they are permitted, what use -specific conditions apply to them, what parking requirements apply to them, and, to a lesser extent, what development standards apply to them. All principal use types are defined and many accessory and temporary use types are also defined. 
ii.  The Use Classifications and Use Types that make up the Principal Use Table are identified and described in Sec. 16-10-103, Use Classifications, Use Types, and Definitions. 
2.   Designation of Principal Uses as Permitted Use, Permitted Use Subject to Conditions, Special Exception Use, or Prohibited Use
The Principal Use Table uses the following abbreviations to designate whether and how a principal use is allowed in a particular zoning district: 
a.  A "P" indicates that the use is allowable as a principal use by right in the corresponding base zoning district , subject to all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance . 
b.  A "PC" indicates that the use is allowable as a principal use in the corresponding base zoning district , subject to referenced use -specific conditions and all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance . 
c.  An "SE" indicates that the use is allowable as a principal use in the corresponding base zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a special exception use , in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.E, Special Exception, and subject to any referenced use -specific conditions and all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance . 
d.  A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited as a principal use in the corresponding base zoning district . 
e.  With its limited land area, sensitive lands , and resort character, the Town of Hilton Head Island is primarily suited for residential, recreational, and some commercial uses . Although it is essential to the community to allow certain uses with a light industrial character, few industrial or heavy commercial uses are appropriate in the Town. Thus, only industrial and heavy commercial uses expressly set forth in the Principal Use Table and accompanying definitions shall be permitted in the Town. All other industrial and heavy commercial uses are otherwise expressly prohibited. 
3.   Reference to Use-Specific Conditions
As noted above, a use allowable as a principal use in a zoning district may be subject to additional conditions that are specific to the use . The applicability of such use -specific conditions is noted through a section reference in the last column of the Principal Use Table titled "Use-Specific Conditions." References refer to standards in Use-Specific Conditions for Principal Uses. 
4.   Development with Multiple Principal Uses
When all principal uses of a development fall within one Use Type, the entire development is assigned to that Use Type. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified as Other Commercial Services because all of the development's principal uses are in that Use Type. When the principal uses of a development fall within different Use Types, each principal use is classified in the applicable Use Type and is subject to all applicable regulations for that Use Type. Development with multiple principal uses , such as shopping centers , shall incorporate only those uses allowed in the underlying district. 
5.   Interpretation of Unlisted Uses
a.   Procedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted
The Official may interpret a use not expressly listed in the Principal Use Table as allowed in a zoning district, in accordance with the procedure in Sec. 16-2-103.R, Written Interpretation, and based on the standards in subparagraph b below. 
b.   Standards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted
The Official shall interpret an unlisted use as permitted in a particular zoning district only after determining that the nature, function, and duration of the use and the impact of allowing it in the zoning district are so similar to those of a Use Type allowable in the zoning district that the unlisted use should be deemed allowable in the same manner as the similar Use Type. In making such determination, the Official shall consider the purpose and intent statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district, the character of uses allowable in the district, and all relevant characteristics of the unlisted use , including but not limited to the following: 
i.  The actual or projected characteristics of the unlisted use in relationship to the stated characteristics of each listed Use Type; 
ii.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the unlisted use ; 
iii.  The relative amounts of sales from each unlisted use ; 
iv.  The customer type for each unlisted use ; 
v.  The relative number of employees in each unlisted use ; 
vi.  The hours of operation; 
vii.  The building and site arrangement; 
viii.  The vehicles used with the unlisted use ; 
ix.  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the unlisted use ; and 
x.  Whether the unlisted use is likely to be found independent of the other listed uses on the site. 
c.   Unlisted Use Not Permitted
If, after applying the criteria in subparagraph b above, the Official determines that a proposed unlisted use is not similar to a listed Use Type, the proposed use shall be prohibited. 
d.   Effect of Approval of Unlisted Use
i.  After interpreting an unlisted use as permitted in a zoning district, the Official shall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or will recur frequently, or whether its omission from the Principal Use Table is likely to lead to uncertainty and confusion. On determining that the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the Official shall ask the Planning Commission to initiate a text amendment to list the use in the Principal Use Table. Until final action is taken on the text amendment application , or the Planning Commission decides not to initiate the requested text amendment, the Official's interpretation shall be binding. 
ii.  If after interpreting an unlisted use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the Official determines that the unlisted use is of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to recur frequently, the interpretation shall be binding in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.R.6, Effect of Interpretation, without further action or amendment of this Ordinance . 
iii.  The Official's interpretation may be appealed in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.T, Appeal of Administrative Decisions and Written Interpretations to Board of Zoning Appeals.

This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses that are incidental and customarily subordinate to principal uses . Specific accessory uses are also considered incidental and subordinate accessory uses , if they comply with all relevant provisions of this Ordinance . The purpose of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses , so long as such uses are located on the same site as the principal use and comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce potentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands , and all requirements under this Ordinance for the principal use to which it is accessory, and all other relevant provisions of this Ordinance . 
B.   Applicability

The Accessory Use/Structure Table in Sec. 16-4-103.D.2 does not list all allowable accessory uses and structures . If a use or structure proposed as an accessory use or structure is not listed in the Accessory Use/Structure table, the characteristics of the particular use or structure relative to the principal use or structure will be considered to determine if the use or structure is an allowable accessory use or structure . 
2.  Sec. 16-4-103.C, General Standards for All Accessory Uses and Structures, establishes general standards that apply to all allowed accessory uses and structures . Sec. 16-4-103.D.2, Accessory Use/Structure Table, shows whether certain types of accessory uses or structures are permitted or prohibited within the various zoning districts. Sec. 16-4-103.E, Use-Specific Conditions for Accessory Uses and Structures, establishes conditions that apply to certain types of accessory uses or structures regardless of the zoning district in which they are allowed, unless expressly stated to the contrary. 
C.   General Standards for All Accessory Uses and Structures
1.  An accessory use or structure shall not be established or constructed before the establishment or construction of the principal use or structure . 
2.  If the principal use or structure is destroyed or removed, and is not rebuilt or replaced within 24 months after the date of the destruction or removal, the accessory use or structure shall no longer be allowed.

Sec.16-5-103. - Buffer Standards 
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the adjacent street and use buffer standards in this section is to spatially separate development from adjacent streets and adjacent development with aesthetically pleasing natural or landscaped buffers. Such buffers are intended to help mitigate potential adverse impacts (e.g., noise, odor, fumes) from adjacent street traffic, create an attractive streetscape for motorists, allow the location of certain dissimilar land uses adjacent to one another by mitigating potential negative effects between the uses , and provide space for landscaping that can help improve air and water quality and be used to reduce stormwater runoff. 
B.   Applicability
1.   General
Except as provided in subsection 2 below, the requirements of this section shall apply to all development in the Town . 
2.   Exceptions
a.  For development within a PD-1 District, adjacent street and use buffer standards shall apply only along those lot lines and street rights-of-way located outside any gates restricting access by the general public to areas within the PUD, or constituting the boundaries of the district. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
b.  For development within a PD-2 District, adjacent street and use buffer standards shall apply only along those lot lines and street rights-of-way located within a Corridor Overlay District or constituting the boundaries of the district. 
c.  For zero lot line subdivisions , adjacent street and use buffer standards shall apply only along those lot lines and street rights-of-way constituting the perimeter of the subdivision . 
d.  Adjacent street buffers shall not apply to development within the CR District. 
C.   Landscape Plan Required
Applications for development where a buffer is required shall include a landscape plan in accordance with the submittal requirements in Appendix D: Application Submittal Requirements. 
D.   Adjacent Street Buffer Requirements
Unless expressly exempted or modified in this subsection, development shall provide a buffer along adjacent streets that is of the type designated in Table 16-5-103.D, Adjacent Street Buffer Requirements, for the proposed use and the classification of the adjacent street .

 d.  The reduction will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; 
 e.  Any adverse impacts directly attributable to the reduction are mitigated; 
 f.  The reduction, when combined with all previous reductions allowed under this provision, does not result in a cumulative reduction greater than a 30 percent in the S District, 20 percent in the RD and IL Districts, or 15 percent in all other districts; and 
 g.  In the S, RD, and IL districts, there are no reasonable options to the reduction that allow development of the site to be designed and located in a way that complies with LMO standards. 
7.  Minimum buffer widths and minimum planting requirements for adjacent use buffers may be reduced by up to 10 percent any district on demonstration to the Official that: 
 a.  The reduction is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land ; 
 b.  Development resulting from the reduction is consistent with the purpose and intent of the adjacent setback standards; 
 c.  The reduction either (a) is required to compensate for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development , or (b) results in improved site conditions for a development with nonconforming site features ; 
 d.  The reduction will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; 
 e.  Any adverse impacts directly attributable to the reduction are mitigated; and 
 f.  The reduction, when combined with all previous reductions allowed under this provision, does not result in a cumulative reduction greater than a 30 percent in the S District, 20 percent in the RD and IL Districts, or 15 percent in all other districts. 
 
(Revised 12-5-2017 - Ordinance 2017-19 ) 
G.   Location of Buffers
Buffer areas shall be located between the property boundary and all development on the site, but not necessarily within the minimum setback. 
H.   Existing Vegetation
1.  If a buffer area has existing trees that are protected under this Ordinance , they shall be preserved and be used as part of the buffer to comply with the buffer standards of this Ordinance . Where groupings of native shrubs are present, their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged. Any clearing or other work in buffers must have the prior approval of the Official . 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
2.  Existing vegetation that is preserved shall not be limbed up from the ground more than five feet to the lowest branches, except: 
a.  Vegetation at intersections may be limbed up to a greater height to ensure compliance with Sec. 16-5-105.H.4, Sight Triangles; and 
b.  If understory planting is proposed, the Official may allow existing vegetation to be limbed up to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to plants. 
3.  The removal of invasive species shall be allowed with an approved replanting plan, if needed. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
I.   Buffer Materials
At the time of planting, overstory and understory trees included as part of required buffers shall comply with the size standards for supplemental and replacement trees in Sec. 16-6-104.I, Standards for Supplemental and Replacement Trees; evergreen shrubs shall be at least three feet in height above ground level. All buffer plantings must be native species of plants, see Appendix C, except where ornamental plantings or plants that have historically been prevalent on Hilton Head Island are approved as part of a Corridor Review approval. 
J.   Development Within Required Buffers
Development is prohibited within required buffers except in accordance with this subsection. 
1.  The following activities may occur in required buffers, unless expressly prohibited elsewhere in this Ordinance . 
a.  Street or driveway access , provided it runs approximately perpendicular to/from the adjacent street right-of-way or common property line. 
b.  Walkways, pathways, trails, benches, bike racks, and other elements associated with passive recreation or the provision of continuous pedestrian and bicycle connections between adjoining properties, provided all landscaping required by Sec. 16-5-103.F, Buffer Types, is provided and the Official determines that installation or maintenance of such elements will minimize impacts on to required vegetation to the maximum extent practicable . 
c.  Lighting fixtures. 
d.  Service and utility lines and minor facilities (e.g. water, sanitary sewer, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable, storm drainage lines, utility boxes and pedestals), subject to the following standards: 
i.  Such lines generally shall run approximately perpendicular to/from the adjacent street right-of-way or common property line. If they must be installed approximately parallel to the street right-of-way or property line, the easement for the lines may be included as part of a required buffer if the easement allows the vegetation or structures necessary to meet buffer screening requirements and provides the requisite visual separation in a manner that is aesthetically acceptable; otherwise, additional buffer width shall be required to provide the space needed for the required buffer screening. 
ii.  Permission for easement and right-of-way disturbance and clearings for such utility and service lines and facilities shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes. 
2.  The following features and activities are allowed within adjacent street buffers only:

( Ord. No. 2015-23 , 11-3-2015)  
Sec.16-5-104. - Open Space Standards 
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose and intent of this section is to ensure a portion of residential development sites is set aside as common open space for the use and enjoyment of the development's occupants and users. Common open space serves numerous purposes, including preservation and protection of natural areas and features, providing opportunities for passive and active recreation, providing areas for people to meet and congregate, and limiting impervious surfaces that adversely impact water quality and the environment. 
B.   Applicability
1.  The provisions of this section apply to any Major Subdivisions (six or more lots ) creating lots for residential development , unless expressly exempted in this section. 
2.  The provisions of this section also shall apply to any Minor Subdivision (five or fewer lots ) creating lots for residential development that is expanded onto adjacent parcels so the total number of lots in the subdivision is greater than five. 
C.   Common Open Space Requirement
1.  At least 16 percent of the land within the subdivision shall consist of common open space meeting the requirements of this section. 
2.  Common open space shall be depicted on any plat of the development submitted for approval and labeled "open space." 
D.   Common Open Space Location and Configuration
Required common open space shall be reasonably accessible from all parts of the subdivision , especially by pathways. 
E.   Ownership, Management and Maintenance of Common Open Space
Common open space shall be maintained so that its use and enjoyment as open space is not diminished or destroyed. Ownership of common open space shall be subject to deed restrictions or recorded covenants and restrictions that prevent development or subsequent subdivision of the common open space and provide responsibility for maintenance of the common open space .  
Sec.16-5-105. - Mobility, Street, and Pathway Standards 
A.   Mobility
1.   Purpose
The purpose of this section is to ensure that development accommodates the safe and efficient movement of motor vehicles, emergency vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians within the development and between the development and external transportation systems, neighboring development , and local destination points such as places of employment, schools, parks, and shopping areas. Such multimodal access and circulation is intended to provide transportation options, increase the effectiveness of local service delivery, reduce emergency response times, promote healthy walking and bicycling, contribute to the attractiveness of the development and community, increase opportunities for interaction between neighbors, reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel times, improve air quality, minimize congestion and traffic conflicts, and preserve the safety and capacity of community transportation systems. 
2.   Applicability
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the standards in this section shall apply to all development . 
3.   Complete Street Design Principles Encouraged
While not required, the use of complete street design principles are encouraged in all development . 
4.   Required Level of Vehicular Access and Circulation
To the maximum extent practicable , a development shall be served by an internal vehicular access and circulation system (including driveways , alleys, fire lanes, and parking lot drive aisles ) that permits safe, convenient, efficient, and orderly movement of vehicles between and among trip origin and destination points within the development , as well as between the internal vehicular circulation system and adjoining parts of an existing or planned external street system. 
5.   Accessway Layout and Design
a.   Adaptation to Site Conditions
The layout of the access and circulation system shall adapt to the site, taking into consideration physical factors such as natural elements, grade, and drainage, as well as aesthetic factors such as the visual impact of the street pattern and the highlighting of special site features. 
b.   Coordination of Vehicular, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Access and Circulation
The vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access and circulation systems in a development shall be coordinated with each other within the development and with such systems adjacent to the development to minimize conflicts. 
c.   Incentives for Vehicular Cross Access Between Adjoining Developments
For each adjoining property to which a development provides vehicular cross access , the number of parking spaces required in accordance with Sec. 16-5-107.D, Parking Space Requirements, may be reduced by five spaces. If the cross access is adjacent to a landscape median at the end of a parking bay, the minimum width of the median as required by Sec. 16-5-107.G.3, Configuration and Landscaping, may be reduced to 12 feet. 
d.   Traffic Control and Calming Measures
Traffic-calming measures—including, but not limited to, diverters, street gardens, landscaped medians, and curvilinear alignments—shall be integrated into a development's vehicular circulation system where necessary to mitigate the impact of traffic. Installation of new speed bumps/humps or changes to existing speed bumps/humps shall be prohibited unless approved by the Fire Marshal. 
e.   Driveway Layout and Design

(C)  Service driveways shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide and no more than 14 feet wide, as measured between the edges of paving. 
(Revised 12-5-2017 - Ordinance 2017-19 ) 
02.  The Official may require a wider driveway on determining that it is needed to facilitate special vehicle or traffic demand requirements. 
iii.  Driveway Surfacing 
Driveways shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, porous paving blocks, compacted shell, gravel, or other material that the Official determines is unlikely to cause substantial maintenance problems. Driveway aprons within a public street right-of-way connecting to a paved street shall be paved with asphalt or concrete in accordance with SCDOT specifications. 
iv.  Turnaround and Surfacing for Long Driveways 
Driveways more than 150 feet long shall have a turnaround and all-weather surfacing adequate for emergency vehicles approved by the Fire Chief for the Town of Hilton Head Island. 
f.   Bikeway Layout and Design
i.  If the location of a proposed development in relation to other potential areas or its location with respect to an overall pathway plan adopted by the Planning Commission reveals that the probable volume of bicycle use warrants the installation of bike paths or bike lanes , the Official is authorized to require them. 
ii.  Bike paths and bike lanes shall be designed and provided in accordance with the latest edition of the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities and S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-3425.

1. One-way streets shall have a minimum clear pavement width of 14 feet. 
2. Shoulders shall be stable areas adjoining both sides of the roadway that are capable of supporting vehicles. They shall have a cross-slope no steeper than 12:1 (8.33%), and be clear of obstructions. If the required shoulder width is not desirable or attainable, raised curbing compliant with SCDOT standards may be substituted for the shoulder. 
3. A hammerhead may be used in place of a cul-de-sac if the maximum AADT are 250 trips or less. 
 
 
2.   Dead-End Streets
No dead-end streets shall be permitted except those classified as a lane or cul-de-sac above. All dead end streets classified as cul-de-sacs require the geometric end treatment required in Sec. 16-5-105.F, Cul-de-Sac, or Sec. 16-5-105.G, Hammerheads. 
3.   Estimate of Annual Average Daily Trips (AADT)
If it is not possible to determine the maximum ADTs to be served by a street at the time of street design due to uncertainty about the type or intensity of use to be served, then the applicant shall estimate the probable uses and intensities and probable ADTs. If the Official determines that such estimates are unrealistic, the Official shall state why and require more realistic estimates. 
E.   Right-of-Way
Right-of-way shall be measured from property line to property line and shall be sufficiently wide to contain the encompassing street elements of street pavement, shoulders, curbing, sidewalks and median (if provided). In addition to a street , It may contain, but is not limited to, utilities (including drainage), signs as allowed by Sec. 16-5-114, Sign Standards, landscaping, and where applicable, pathways. The street elements required vary depending on intensity of development and street order. Minimum rights-of-way shall be provided in Sec. 16-5-105.D.1, Street Standards. 
F.   Cul-de-Sac
To be classified as a cul-de-sac , a street must terminate at one end with the hammerhead or cul-de-sac geometric end treatment described in 16-5-105.F and 16-5-105.G, respectively. 
1.  A residential cul-de-sac shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 65 feet and a minimum outside edge-of-pavement radius of 55 feet. 
2.  A nonresidential cul-de-sac shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 75 feet and a minimum outside edge-of-pavement radius of 65 feet. 
3.  A cul-de-sac shall have a minimum width of 20 feet of unobstructed pavement. 
4.  A residential cul-de-sac shall have a maximum length of 1,000 feet.

H.   Street Intersections
1.   Minimum Intersection Angle
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practical and in no case shall be less than 75 degrees, with the angle measured at a distance of 100 feet from the centerline of the existing roadway (measured from a point of tangency if in a curve) to the centerline of the new roadway . 
2.   Minimum Centerline Offset of Adjacent Intersections
New intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide with and, if practical, be directly opposite any existing intersections on the opposite side of the street . For all streets , the use of "T" intersections in subdivisions is encouraged. To avoid corner-cutting when inadequate offsets exist between adjacent intersections, offsets shall be at least 125 feet between centerlines of intersecting streets . 
3.   Grade
Intersections shall be designed with a relatively flat grade wherever practical. Maximum grade within intersections shall be five percent except within collectors and lower order streets , where the maximum grade shall be three percent. 
4.   Sight Triangles
a.  Sight triangles shall be required and shall include the area on each street corner that is bounded by the line that connects the "connecting" points located on each of the right-of-way lines of the intersecting street (see Figure 16-5-105.H.1: Sight Triangle Visual Clearance). 
b.  No structure or plantings (at mature growth) exceeding 30 inches in height above the street grade shall be permitted within the sight triangle . Exceptions are permitted for trees if the lower canopy of the trees allows a clear line of sight between three feet and seven feet above the street grade and the trunks of such trees are sufficiently spaced or are so located as to be unlikely to substantially interrupt the line of sight. 
 
Figure 16-5-105.H.1: Sight Triangle Visual Clearance 
c.  Obstruction of a sight triangle is considered a violation of this Ordinance . Clearance of an obstruction shall be enforced in accordance with Chapter 16-8: Enforcement.

In addition, any driveway access on the street without the deceleration lane shall be a minimum of 150 feet from the intersection. In any case, where neither street is obviously dominant (due to equal order hierarchy, signalization or other similar factor), then both streets shall provide full-width deceleration or right-turn lanes, as appropriate, at least 150 feet long. 
 
Figure 16-5-105.H.6: Deceleration Lanes 
7.   Stacking Depth
Development on major arterials shall provide a drive aisle not less than 100 feet long from the arterial, measured from edge-of-pavement to edge-of-pavement (including deceleration lanes), so as to provide adequate stacking room for vehicles entering the development . Such drive aisles shall be free of any elements that may impede vehicle travel. 
I.   Access to Streets
1.   Major Arterials
Along the same side of major arterials, no street , driveway , or other vehicular access point shall enter at a point nearer than 500 feet from the centerline of an existing or final approved street , driveway , or other vehicular access point to the centerline of the proposed vehicular access . 
2.   Minor Arterials
Along the same side of minor arterials no street , driveway , or other vehicular access point shall enter at a point nearer than 200 feet from the centerline of an existing or final approved street , driveway , or other vehicular access point to the centerline of the proposed vehicular access . 
3.   All Other Streets
Along the same side of all other streets , no street , driveway , or other vehicular access point shall enter at a point nearer than 100 feet from the centerline of an existing or final approved street , driveway , or other vehicular access point to the centerline of the proposed vehicular access —provided, however, that this minimum separation standards shall not apply to vehicular access points serving single-family dwellings in subdivisions . 
4.   One-Way Access Points
When evaluating the required minimum distance separation between vehicular access points along the same side of a street , a pair of one-way vehicular access points may be considered a single vehicular access point centered midway between the pair. The centerline-to-centerline spacing between any ingress/egress pair must be a minimum of 100 feet, unless the one-way pair is divided by a median that is 20 feet wide or less. A one-way vehicular access point shall have a width of not less than 14 feet or more than 20 feet. These vehicular access points shall attain at least one-half of the minimum distance separation from adjacent vehicular access points that would otherwise be required. 
 
Figure 16-5-105.I.4: Separation Requirements for One-Way Access Points 
 
5.   Median Cuts
New median cuts on major arterials shall be at least 1,000 feet from existing or approved median cuts and shall have left-turn deceleration lanes in each direction at the median cut. 
6.   Frontage Required

b.  Gates shall have an unobstructed opening of not less than 14 feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic. 
c.  Gates shall be located at least 100 feet from any arterial or collector street , and shall comply with the stacking distance standards in Sec. 16-5-105.A.5.f, Vehicle Stacking Distance for Drive-Through and Related Uses. 
8.   Waiver
Where the applicant demonstrates that a lot of record would be rendered unusable by the strict application of the standards in this subsection (Sec. 16-5-105.I, Access to Streets) and that the vehicular access point is otherwise optimally located so as to provide acceptable turning radii and minimize adverse impact (including turning movements and visual impact of "strip development " resulting from the less than minimum separation of access points from the roadway ), the Official may waive the standard. A request for such a waiver shall be accompanied by: 
a.  Ownership and recording data associated with the lot of record ; 
b.  Written evidence that an applicant has explored all feasible alternatives to the standard for controlled vehicular access —including, but not limited to, joint use with adjoining properties, vehicular access from adjacent minor streets , and establishment of frontage space or frontage street access ;

Sec.16-5-106. - Traffic Analysis Standards 
A.   Purpose
The purpose of this section is to guide development in accordance with the existing and future needs of the Town in order to protect, promote and improve the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, appearance, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of the Town , by ensuring new development does not overburden and congest the Town's streets . 
B.   Intent
The regulations of this section are designed and intended: 
1.  To ensure that the Town's adopted traffic service level standards are met within the Town and to provide safety from fire, panic and other dangers, to promote the public health and general welfare, to prevent the overcrowding of land , to avoid undue concentration of population, and to facilitate the adequate provision of street facilities. 
2.  To enable the Town to conduct an appropriate review and evaluation of the traffic impact of proposed development , to provide for the imposition of conditions in order to assure that new development does not impair the Town's ability and obligation to provide adequate street facilities to all its citizens, and to prescribe necessary project-specific mitigation measures or to otherwise condition traffic impact analysis plan approval. 
3.  To ensure that no traffic impact analysis plan approvals are granted that would cause a reduction in the service level of any street facility that is currently operating in a manner that fails to satisfy the Town's adopted traffic service level standards . 
4.  To ensure that no traffic impact analysis plan approvals are granted unless street facilities with adequate capacity to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development are available concurrently with the scheduled opening of the development . 
5.  To establish uniform procedures for the review of applications for traffic impact analysis plan approval subject to the traffic impact analysis plan requirements set forth herein. 
6.  To better coordinate the short-term growth potential of the Town with the immediately available street system capacity, taking into account exempt development and approved development that has not been built, to the extent to which these may be eligible for development plan approval without being subject to the traffic impact analysis plan requirements of this section. 
7.  To better coordinate the long-term growth potential of the Town with a realistic assessment of street capacity which is currently and which may in the future become available, recognizing the limitations on the Town's financial resources, the constraints presented by the geography of the Island, and the need to preserve the Island's sensitive natural, historic, and environmental resources. 
8.  To better coordinate the type, location, amount, timing, and rate of development of proposed land uses in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan , zoning district regulations, and Official Zoning Map with the present and projected future availability of street system capacity. 
9.  To establish and maintain a traffic monitoring system to regularly determine the volume of traffic on the Town ' s street system and the degree to which capacity limits ("thresholds") are being approached or exceeded. 
10.  It is not the intent of this section to deny to any person a reasonable opportunity to develop land in a beneficial manner, but rather to coordinate the type, location, amount, timing, and rate of development with the Town's reasonable ability to provide adequate public street facilities consistent with the Town's adopted traffic service level standards . 
C.   Traffic Impact Analysis Plan Standards
All required traffic impact analysis plans shall, at a minimum, indicate compliance or non-compliance with the standards of this section. 
1.  The average total delay in seconds per vehicle for each signalized intersection does not exceed 55.0 seconds during the peak hour for an average June weekday; and 
2.  The volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio for each signalized intersection does not exceed 0.90 during the peak hour for an average June weekday; and 
3.  The average total delay on any approach to a traffic circle or roundabout does not exceed 150 seconds per vehicle during the peak hour for an average June weekday.  
Sec.16-5-107. - Parking and Loading Standards 
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this section is to ensure provision of parking and loading facilities in proportion to the generalized parking and loading demand of the different uses allowed by this Ordinance . The standards in this section are intended to provide for adequate off-street parking and loading while allowing the flexibility needed to accommodate alternative solutions. The standards are also intended to achieve Town policies of supporting development and redevelopment and avoiding excessive paved surface areas. 
B.   Applicability
1.  All development shall provide off-street parking and loading areas in accordance with the standards of this section. 
2.  Any change in use of an existing development that does not involve expansion or remodeling subject to paragraph 3 below, shall comply with the standards this section as applied to the new use , to the maximum extent practicable . 
3.  Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 16-7-105, Nonconforming Site Features, any expansion or remodeling of an existing use or structure that results in an increase in the number of dwelling units , square feet, rooms, seats, or other unit on which calculation of the minimum number of required parking or loading spaces is based shall provide additional off-street parking and loading spaces as required by application of the standards of this section to such increase, to the maximum extent practicable . 
C.   Use of Parking and Loading Areas
Off-street parking areas required by this section shall be used solely for the parking of licensed motorized vehicles in operating condition. Required parking spaces and loading berths may not be used for the display of goods for sale, or the sale, lease, storage, dismantling, or service of any vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes , building materials, equipment, or supplies. 
D.   Parking Space Requirements
1.   Minimum Number of Parking Spaces
Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Ordinance , development shall provide the minimum number of off-street parking spaces in accordance with Table 16-5-107.D.1, Minimum Number of Parking Spaces, based on the principal use(s) involved and the extent of development .

2.   Uses with Variable Parking Demand Characteristics and Unlisted Uses
For some listed uses , Table 16-5-107.D.1, Minimum Number of Parking Spaces, refers to this subparagraph because the use has widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to establish a single appropriate off-street parking or loading standard. On receiving an application proposing such a use , or proposing a use not expressly listed in Table 16-5-107.D.1, Minimum Number of Parking Spaces, the Official is authorized to: 
a.  Apply the minimum off-street parking space requirement specified in Table 16-5-107.D.1, Minimum Number of Parking Spaces, for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use ; or 
b.  Establish the minimum off-street parking space requirement by reference to standard parking resources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association; or 
c.  Establish the minimum off-street parking space requirement based on a parking demand study prepared by the applicant that estimates parking demand based on the recommendations of the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual , and that includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density , scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. 
3.   Multiple Use Development
Development containing more than one principal use shall provide parking spaces in an amount equal to the total of the requirements applied to all individual principal uses. This provision shall not limit the opportunity to reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces through approval of an alternative parking plan that justifies the feasibility ofshared parking(see Sec. 16-5-107.H.3, Shared Parking.) 
4.   Fleet Vehicle Storage
a.  If the Official determines that normal operation of a development requires that a number of vehicles be stored on site at any one time—including, but not limited to, taxicab service , auto rental, auto sales , towing service, and tractor or truck rental—a sufficient number of spaces or a sufficient area for vehicle storage shall be provided. 
b.  No area allocated to fleet vehicle storage may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for fleet vehicle storage. 
5.   Maximum Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces
The number of off-street parking spaces shall not exceed 120 percent of the minimum number required for any eating establishment use , or 105 percent of the minimum number required for any other use , except as may be allowed through approval of an alternative parking plan in accordance with Sec. 16-5-107.H.2, Provision over Maximum Allowed. Any parking spaces allowed above the maximum in accordance with this section shall be pervious . 
6.   Accessible Parking Spaces for Physically Disabled Persons
In each off-street parking area, a portion of the total number of off-street parking spaces shall be spaces specifically designated, located, and reserved for use by persons with physical disabilities ("accessible parking spaces"), in accordance with the standards of the latest adopted edition of the IBC and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended. 
7.   Parallel Parking Spaces
Up to 20 percent of the required number of off-street parking spaces may be designed as parallel parking spaces. 
8.   Compact Parking Spaces
Up to 20 percent of the required number of off-street parking spaces may be designed and designated as compact parking spaces. Compact parking spaces shall be grouped where possible and located where they can be readily identified by compact vehicle drivers, and designated by signage or pavement marking incorporating the word "COMPACT" with letters at least 12 inches high. 
9.   Temporary Parking for Passenger Drop-Off and Pick-Up
Uses that involve the frequent stopping of vehicles (including taxis, limousines, vans, and passenger vehicles) to drop-off or pick-up passengers (e.g., schools, recreation/entertainment facilities, hotels )—and especially nightclubs , bars, or eating establishments that serve alcohol—are encouraged to supplement required parking with a designated area for temporary parking and the dropping off or picking up of passengers. Such spaces shall comply with parking space dimension standards, but the Official may waive other parking standards as necessary to accommodate such areas. 
10.   Use of Parking Spaces as Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station
All multifamily and nonresidential development shall provide one electric vehicle (EV) charging station per site . If the development requires over 100 parking spaces, the electric vehicle (EV) charging station shall have a sign that states that only electric vehicles being charged can park in that particular parking space. If the square footage of an existing building on a site is being increased by more than 50% then the applicant will be required to provide an EV charging station on site.

a.   Maximum Shared Spaces
Up to 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required for a use may be used to satisfy the number of parking spaces required for other uses , provided the uses generate parking demands during different times of the day or different days of the week. 
b.   Location and Pedestrian Access
i.  Shared parking spaces other than those serving development in the CR District shall be located no more than 500 feet walking distance from the primary pedestrian entrance(s) to the uses served by the parking, as measured along sidewalks or other pedestrian accessways connecting the shared spaces and such entrance(s). 
ii.  Adequate and safe pedestrian access shall be provided between the shared parking spaces and the primary pedestrian entrances to the uses served by the parking. 
iii.  Shared parking spaces shall not be separated from the use they serve by an arterial street unless pedestrian access across the arterial street is provided by a grade-separated pedestrian walkway or appropriate traffic controls (e.g., signalized crosswalk). 
c.   Justification
The alternative parking plan shall include justification of the feasibility of shared parking among the proposed uses . Such justification shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the uses proposed to share off-street parking spaces, the composition of their tenants, the types and hours of their operations, the anticipated peak parking and traffic demands they generate, and the anticipated rate of turnover in parking space use. 
d.   Shared Parking Agreement
i.  An approved shared parking arrangement shall be enforced through written agreement among all the owners of lands containing the uses proposed to share off-street parking spaces. 
ii.  The agreement shall provide all parties the right to joint use of the shared parking area for as long the shared parking spaces are needed to comply with this Ordinance , and shall be binding on subsequent owners. 
iii.  The agreement shall be submitted to the Official for review and approval before execution. 
iv.  A Certified True Copy of an approved agreement that has been recorded in the Beaufort County Register of Deeds shall be delivered to the Official before issuance of a Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any use to be served by the shared parking area. 
v.  Any termination of the shared parking agreement does not negate the parties' obligations to comply with parking requirements and thus shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance . No use served by the shared parking may be continued if the shared parking becomes unavailable to the use unless substitute off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with this section. 
4.   Off-Site Parking
An alternative parking plan may propose to meet a portion of the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces with off-site parking in accordance with the following standards. 
a.   Maximum Off-Site Spaces
Off-site parking may be used to satisfy up to 100 percent of the number of parking spaces required for a use in the CR District. Off-site parking may be used to satisfy up to 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required for a use in any other district. 
b.   Zoning
The zoning district classification of the off-site parking area shall be one that allows the use served by off-site parking (and thus off-street parking accessory to such use ). 
c.   Location and Pedestrian Access
i.  Off-site parking spaces other than those serving development in the CR District shall be located no more than 500 feet walking distance from the pedestrian entrance(s) to the uses served by the parking, as measured along sidewalks or other pedestrian accessways connecting the shared spaces and such entrance(s). 
ii.  Adequate and safe pedestrian access shall be provided between the off-site parking spaces and the primary pedestrian entrances to the uses served by the parking.

d.   Off-Site Parking Agreement
i.  If land containing the off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as land containing the principal use served, the off-site parking arrangement shall be established in a written agreement between the owners or long-term lessees of land containing the off-site parking area and land containing the served use . 
ii.  The agreement shall provide the owner of the served use the right to use the off-site parking area for as long the shared parking spaces are needed to comply with this Ordinance , and shall be binding on subsequent owners or long-term lessees. 
iii.  The agreement shall be submitted to the Official for review and approval before execution. 
iv.  An attested copy of an approved and executed agreement shall be recorded with the Beaufort County Register of Deeds before issuance of a Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. 
v.  Any termination of an off-site parking agreement or transfer of land containing the off-site parking area does not negate the developer's obligation to comply with parking requirements and thus shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance . No use served by the off-site parking may be continued if the off-site parking becomes unavailable unless substitute off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with this section and this Ordinance . 
5.   Deferred Parking
An alternative parking plan may propose to defer construction of up to 20 percent of the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces, in accordance with the following standards: 
a.   Justification
The alternative parking plan shall include an assessment demonstrating that because of the location, nature, or mix of uses , there is a reasonable probability the number of parking spaces actually needed to serve the development is less than the minimum required by the Minimum Number of Parking Spaces table in Sec. 16-5-107.D.1. 
b.   Reserve Parking Plan
The alternative parking plan shall include a reserve parking plan identifying the amount of off-street parking being deferred and the location of the area to be reserved for future parking, if future parking is needed.

i.  The alternative parking plan shall provide assurance that within 18 months after the initial Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the proposed development , an off-street parking demand study evaluating the adequacy of the existing parking spaces in meeting the off-street parking demand generated by the development will be submitted to the Official . 
ii.  If the Official determines that the study indicates the existing parking is adequate, then construction of the remaining number of parking spaces shall not be required and the areas reserved for future parking shall no longer be so reserved. If the Official determines that the study indicates additional parking is needed, such parking shall be provided consistent with the reserve parking plan and the standards of this section. 
d.   Maintenance of Reserve Areas as Open Space
As long as areas are reserved for future parking, they shall be maintained as open space , without any clearing of trees . During such time, the reserve areas shall not count as open space for purposes of complying with Sec. 16-5-104, Open Space Standards, and shall count as impervious surface for purposes of complying with Sec. 16-5-109, Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Standards. 
e.   Deferred Parking Agreement
i.  A deferred parking agreement shall be included as part of any development approval which includes deferred parking. The agreement shall incorporate by reference the deferred parking plan and agreement by the owner to reserve a future parking area as open space consistent with the deferred parking plan, and assurances that a parking demand study will be completed in accordance with the terms of the development approval and this section, and additional parking provided, if determined necessary. 
ii.  An attested copy of an approved and executed agreement shall be recorded with the Beaufort County Register of Deeds before issuance of a Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any use subject to deferred parking. 
iii.  Any termination of a deferred parking agreement does not negate the developer's and owner's obligation to comply with parking requirements of this Ordinance . Failure to comply shall constitute a violation. 
6.   On-Street Parking
An alternative parking plan may propose to meet a portion of the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces with on-street parking spaces, in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  On-street parking may be used to satisfy up to 100 percent of the number of parking spaces required for a use in the CR District. 
b.  The on-street parking spaces shall be located along the development site's street frontage or no more than 150 feet walking distance from the primary entrance(s) of the proposed use , as measured along sidewalks or other pedestrian accessways connecting the on-street spaces and such entrance(s). 
c.  The on-street parking spaces are not counted towards meeting the off-street parking requirement for any other development ; and 
d.  There is no negative impact to existing or planned traffic circulation patterns. 
7.   Bicycle Parking
a.  All multifamily and nonresidential development shall provide bike racks sufficient to accommodate the parking of at least four bicycles for every ten vehicle parking spaces required, or major fraction thereof except that once twenty bicycle parking spaces are provided, any required bicycle parking after that shall be required at a ratio of two bicycle parking spaces for every ten vehicle parking spaces, or major fraction, thereof. An applicant may use developer submitted data to demonstrate fewer bicycle parking spaces should be required. If a lower number of bicycle parking spaces is accepted, the applicant shall submit a site plan that includes a reserve parking plan identifying the amount of bicycle parking spaces being deferred and the location of the area to be reserved for future bicycle parking, if future bicycle parking is needed. If the proposed project does not reasonably connect to a Town multi-purpose pathway, then the required bicycle parking spaces can be reduced. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
b.  The bike racks shall be located in visible, well-lit areas and shall be in an area maintained with an all weather surface. They shall be located where they do not interfere with pedestrian traffic and are protected from conflicts with vehicular traffic. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
c.  The required minimum number of vehicular parking spaces shall be reduced by one space for every ten bicycle parking spaces provided. 
d.  If the square footage of an existing building on a site is being increased by more than 50% then the applicant will be required to meet the bicycle parking standards.

D.   Drainage Design Standards
1.   General
a.   Design Methodology
i.  The two accepted hydrological methodologies for computing surface runoff are the rational method and the USDA NRCS TR-55 method. Other methods approved by the Town Engineer are allowable. 
ii.  The rational method may be used only for sizing individual culverts or storm drains that are not part of a pipe network or system and have a contributing drainage area of 20 acres or less. 
iii.  The USDA NRCS TR-55 method or other approved methodology may be used for sites of any size. 
iv.  Proposed development design shall consider the hydrological features within the total watershed, including the development site, upstream and downstream areas. 
b.   Site Area
The site area incorporated in stormwater management design shall be the total area of proposed development , including any noncontiguous lands that are part of a Planned Development, which is owned in fee simple by the landowner / developer of the Planned Development, or is included in perpetual cross easements for drainage purposes. 
c.   Design Storm
The design storm, to be used in the design of all drainage systems and permanent stormwater management facilities, is the 25-year frequency/24-hour/8.4-Inch rainfall and Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC II). 
d.   Engineering Checklist
Detailed design standards for all stormwater management systems required by this section can be found in the Engineering Checklist maintained by the Town Engineer. 
2.   Pre-Development Peak Discharge Rates
a.  All development shall incorporate stormwater management facilities sufficient to ensure that for the design storm and Type III rainfall distribution, the post- development peak discharge rate across adjacent property lines will not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rate. In the case of redevelopment, the pre-development condition shall be defined as the existing state at the time of development application . 
b.  Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) shall be used to retain and detain the increased and accelerated runoff that the development generates. 
c.  The Town Engineer may waive this peak discharge requirement on determining that the applicant has demonstrated that: 
i.  A suitable means of flow into a downstream tidal discharge point is accessible; or 
ii.  The development includes a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site flows to an ultimate downstream tidal discharge point. 
3.   On-Site Retention of First Inch of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site retention (dry or wet) or percolation of a minimum of one inch of runoff from on-site impervious surfaces . Major drainage canals may not be used for retention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  The one inch of runoff from all such impervious surfaces shall be dissipated by percolation into the soil, evaporation, or other methods of treatment or handling acceptable to the Town Engineer. 
c.  Where on-site retention of runoff is also required by OCRM standards, evidence of OCRM approval of the on-site retention shall be submitted to the Town Engineer. 
4.   On-Site Detention or Percolation of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation of stormwater runoff that is sufficient to maintain the same peak discharge rate as occurred pre-development. Major drainage canals may not be used for detention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  Off-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation areas may be used, provided: 
i.  The Town Engineer determines that such improvements are in the common good and are of satisfactory design to cause no hardship to others utilizing the same drainageway, whether on-site or upstream or downstream; 
ii.  A recorded, permanent drainage easement is provided that complies with this section and Sec. 16-5-109.G, Drainage Easements, and benefits the land described in the application for development permit; 
iii.  Adequate maintenance of the areas is provided for in accordance with Sec. 16-5-109.H.1, Ownership and Maintenance Responsibility; and 
iv.  The developer bears the total cost of the areas and their detention or percolation facilities. 
5.   Design of Detention and Retention Facilities
a.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed to provide at least one-half foot of freeboard or vertical detention storage volume for runoff above the design storm peak elevation. 
b.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed for ten-year sediment loads before the one-half foot storage volume required in subparagraph a above is included. Sediment storage may be accommodated below the dry weather water level design, as long as an adequate permanent pool depth is maintained. 
c.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed with relatively flat side slopes (maximum horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:1) along the shoreline. 
d.  Where possible, detention and retention facilities shall be designed with meandering shorelines to increase the length of shoreline, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation for pollution control purposes. 
e.  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the banks shall be sloped to the proposed dry weather water surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted for approval. 
6.   Adequate Outfall
A developer shall provide adequate outfall ditches, pipes, and easements downstream from a proposed discharge if public or private facilities adequate to carry the proposed discharge do not exist or are not available for use by the developer . 
7.   Use of Wetlands
a.  The use of wetlands for stormwater retention is allowable with approval by the Town Engineer. Adjacent BMPs that benefit from retention of normal wetland water table elevations are acceptable. 
b.  Regulated wetlands shall not be disturbed by the construction of BMPs in them or sufficiently near to deprive them of required runoff or to lower their normal water table elevations. 
c.  If a BMP is proposed to be located near a regulated wetland or in a required wetland buffer (see Sec. 16-6-102, Wetland Protection), the applicant will provide data showing that impacts will not be detrimental to the wetland or wetland buffer , and the BMPs shall include flow dissipation devices ensuring that discharge to wetlands occurs at non-erosive velocities. 
8.   Incorporation of Stormwater Management into Landscape Design
Final landscape designs and plantings shall not adversely affect stormwater conveyance or maintenance of stormwater management facilities, but rather should further opportunities for percolation, retention, detention , filtration, and plant absorption of site-generated stormwater runoff (e.g., using low impact development (LID) measures—see guides in Sec. 16-5-109.C.9, Reference Guides). 
E.   Inspection and Certification of Construction
The application for a Certificate of Compliance for a development , or approved phase thereof, shall include certification by a professional engineer registered in South Carolina that the development site work was constructed in accordance with approved plans and the requirements of this Ordinance . Prior to approval of such application , the Town Engineer or his or her designee shall conduct an inspection of constructed stormwater management facilities. Any deficiencies identified by the inspection shall be corrected before a Certificate of Compliance is issued. 
F.   As-Built Survey
1.  Before issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, the applicant shall submit to the Town Engineer an as-built survey prepared and certified by a South Carolina professional land surveyor that accurately identifies and depicts the horizontal location of all property corners, easements , and the horizontal and vertical locations of all on-site improvements .

Sec.16-5-115.   Subdivision Standards
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of subdivision layout is to create a functional and attractive development with infrastructure and lots appropriately sized and located to minimize adverse impacts. The intent of this section is to provide clear requirements and guidelines for subdivision design for both Major and Minor Subdivisions. Subdivisions should promote the health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and welfare of the present and future residents of the Town by: 
a.  Providing for the orderly growth and development of the Town ; 
b.  Coordinating with the existing street system, transportation plans, and public facilities; 
c.  Providing right-of-way for street and vehicular easements ; 
d.  Avoiding congestion and overcrowding and encouraging proper arrangement of streets in relation to existing planned streets ; 
e.  Ensuring there is adequate open space and recreation facilities; and 
f.  Ensuring there is proper recordation of land ownership. 
B.   Applicability
Subdivisions shall comply with all applicable design and performance standards of this section and this Ordinance , including the adjacent setback and buffer standards in Sec. 16-5-102 and 16-5-103. 
C.   General Requirements
1.  Layout of the subdivision shall be based on complete site analysis. Streets and lots shall be designed and situated to minimize alteration of natural and historic site features to be preserved. 
2.  The subdivision layout shall consider the practicality and economic feasibility of development of individual lots including the environmental characteristics, size of the site , and the requirements of this Ordinance . 
3.  Unique and fragile elements including, but not limited to wetlands, significant stands of trees and individual trees of significant size, shall be preserved where practical, with development reserved for environmentally stable areas. 
4.  Open space and recreational areas shall be planned in accordance with Sec. 16-5-104, Open Space Standards. 
5.  Lots shall be situated so that stormwater may be easily directed away from buildings in subsequent site -specific development . Lots shall be configured so that buildings and general flood sensitive site facilities can be located out of drainageways. Subdivisions shall be designed so as to comply with Sec. 16-5-109, Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Standards. 
6.  All lots shall have the access required by Sec. 16-5-105.I, Access to Streets. 
D.   Layout of Lots and Blocks
1.  Subdivisions may be laid out in conventional, cluster, or a combination of block/ lot designs. 
2.  The lot configuration and shape shall provide appropriate sites for buildings , and be properly related to topography, natural elements, access , drainage and utilities, and conform to all requirements of this Ordinance . 
3.  The dimensions of corner lots shall permit the required minimum setbacks from streets (see Sec. 16-5-102, Setback Standards) and required site triangles (see Sec. 16-5-105.H.4, Sight Triangles). 
4.  The number of lots within a block shall be as appropriate for the location and the type of development contemplated, as practical. Visual monotony created by excessive blocks of lots which are not interrupted by intersections, open space , buffers or features shall be avoided. 
5.  Pathways and sidewalks are encouraged throughout the subdivision . Pathways and sidewalks may be required by the Official to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping, or other community facilities. Interconnection with other pathways and sidewalks is also desirable. 
E.   Street Access
1.  All Major Subdivisions shall have direct vehicular access to a public street that meets the standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
2.  Minor Subdivisions shall be permitted to provide vehicular access to lots via a minimum 20-foot wide unobstructed access easement, provided the access easement complies with the following standards: 
a.  Access easements shall contain an all-weather driving surface approved by the Fire Chief for the Town of Hilton Head Island. 
b.  Dead-end easements shall have a turn-around as required by the latest edition of the International Fire Code as adopted by Town Council . 
c.  No access easement shall be permitted to exceed a maximum traffic volume of 50 ADT due to the further subdivision of lots without upgrading the accessway to meet the design standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
d.  Access easements are not allowed in any wetland buffer required by Sec. 16-6-102.D, Wetland Buffer Standards, except for approximately perpendicular crossings as approved by the Official .

Alternatively, control monuments may be placed in open space areas, park areas, and the like. The control monument shall be placed in a manner satisfactory to the Town Engineer. 
b.  Corner monuments or markers shall be installed at all lot corners. 
c.  All corner monuments or markers shall consist of a concrete marker with metal cap marking the exact corner and bearing the name of the surveying company or the land surveyor in responsible charge of the survey. If the corner location falls on pavement, concrete, or other material where it cannot be marked with a cap, a shaft of ferrous metal (iron pipe or bar), spikes, or scribes may be installed in or on the surface. These methods shall be used unless exceptional circumstances warrant the use of other materials. 
d.  If a corner cannot be monumented or marked, one or more witness monuments shall be placed on the boundary line and described by bearings or distances so that the inaccessible point may be located accurately on the ground. A witness monument shall adhere to the same standards applicable to a corner monument. 
2.   Addressing and Lot Numbering
The Official shall determine a method of street addressing/ lot numbering. Applicants should consult with the Town for site -specific review.

Sec.16-5-116.   Impact Fees
A.   Purpose
This section is intended to ensure timely construction of off-site public capital improvements that are necessary to serve new development by ensuring that necessary financing is available for such improvements . The impact fees to be paid by each new development in accordance with this section is to be proportional to the impact that the new development will have on the types of facilities for which the fees are charged. 
B.   Applicability
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all development , unless otherwise provided herein. 
1.  The movement of a structure onto a lot shall be considered development and shall be subject to these impact fee provisions, unless otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 below. 
2.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to the following actions: 
a.  The movement of a manufactured home onto a lot or parcel for use as a residence that does not result in a net increase in the number of manufactured home sites on the Island; 
b.  Placing on a lot in the Town a temporary construction trailer or office, but only for the life of the Building Permit issued for the construction served by the trailer or office; 
c.  Converting an existing structure from one use to another; and 
d.  Any development , including but not limited to the mere subdivision of land , installation of utilities, or the use of land for limited recreational, agricultural, filling or dredging purposes, which, in the opinion of the Official , will not result in a net increase of more than one one-way ADT. 
3.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to public projects. 
C.   Impact Fee Benefit District
1.  There shall be one impact fee benefit district that encompasses the entire Town . 
2.  The appropriateness of the designation and boundaries of the benefit district shall be reviewed by the Town as part of the impact fee revision process set forth below. Following such review and a public hearing, the benefit district may be amended. 
3.  Impact fees collected within the benefit district shall be spent within the benefit district. 
D.   Payment of Impact Fee as Condition of Approval
Until any impact fee required by this section has been paid in full, no Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to Development Plan Review for any development that is not exempted by Sec. 16-5-116.B, Applicability, shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. 
E.   Calculation of Fees Using Fee Schedule
Impact fees shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  Unless an applicant requests an administrative determination or individual assessment as set forth in the following subsections, the impact fees shall be calculated for the proposed development based on the Development Plan Approval or permit allowing the use , according to the applicable fee schedule. 
2.  The following impact fee schedules are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference: 
a.  Transportation Impact Fee Schedule 
3.  The units of development specified in the fee schedule shall be interpreted as follows: 
a.  A hotel "room" shall include any space that is part of the same rental unit and that does not have a separate entrance. 
b.  Building square footage shall be measured in terms of gross floor area . 
4.  For categories of uses not specified in the applicable impact fee schedule, the Official shall apply the category of use set forth in the applicable fee schedule that is deemed to be most similar to the proposed use . 
5.  If the Development Plan Approval or permit for the proposed development indicates a mix of uses in the development , the impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use according to the fee schedule, and the results aggregated. 
6.  For an addition to or replacement of existing structures , the impact fee to be paid shall be the difference, if any, between: 
a.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for existing development on the site or, in the case of demolition or removal of a structure , the previous development on the site , provided that the demolition or removal occurred after October 23, 1989, or within ten years of the date of submittal of the application for which impact fees are assessed, whichever is less; and 
b.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for the total development on the site after the new development . 
7.  Upon written request of an applicant , the Official shall provide an estimate of the current fee based on the data provided by the applicant . However, the Official shall not be responsible for determining at such preliminary date the accuracy of the information provided. 
F.   Individual Assessment of Impact Fees
1.  If any person submitting an application for which payment of an impact fee is a prerequisite to approval believes that the impacts of the proposed development will be substantially less than would be indicated by using a strict interpretation of the fee schedule or an administrative determination of the fee, such person may request that the Town perform an individual assessment of the impact of the proposed development , consistent with the methodology set forth in paragraph 2 below. A request for an individual assessment must be made prior to submittal of an application for a Building Permit . 
2.  The individual assessment shall be subject to the Transportation Impact Fees as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.R, Individual Transportation Fee Assessments. 
3.  The Town shall accept the calculations of the individual assessment if the Planning Commission finds at a public meeting that: 
a.  The proposed development is in fact so unique in the impacts it will generate that the strict application of the fee schedule or administrative determination would result in inaccurate impact projections; and 
b.  The individual assessment results in a fee which differs by at least five percent from the fees calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
4.  If the Town accepts the computations of the individual assessment under this section, the applicable fee shall be determined from the individual assessment, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the fee calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
G.   Collection of Impact Fees
The collection of impact fees shall be as follows: 
1.  Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the impact fees for all new development shall be calculated and collected in conjunction with the application for the first Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan for such development , whichever occurs first in time. 
2.  For other uses not ultimately requiring a Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan, the fee shall be calculated and collected at the time of approval of the Development Plan. 
H.   Fund Accounting for Impact Fees
1.  The Town shall establish a separate accounting fund in which the impact fees collected for a particular type of facility within the benefit district shall be credited. Such fees shall be invested by the Town and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the Town , shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the Town . Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. 
2.  Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for such fund. 
3.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for such accounting fund showing the revenues to such fund and the disbursements from such fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town .

Transportation Impact Fees shall only be spent on qualifying public street and pathway improvements , as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees. 
J.   Refunds of Impact Fees
1.  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected in accordance with this section that has not been committed for a use permitted by Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees, within six years from the last day of the fiscal year in which it was received by the Town , shall be refunded to the current record owner of the property upon written application . Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" when they have been spent or encumbered by contract. Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" in the order in which they are received and committed by the Town . The refund shall include accrued interest at the rate of return on investments earned by the Town on such amount. In disbursing such funds the Town may rely on the written certification of the current record owner of the property as to his or her entitlement to the refund, in the absence of a written assertion by another party that such proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in doubt, the Town may deposit such funds in an appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In such event, the Town may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable cost of causing the funds to be deposited with the court, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
2.  If development for which an impact fee has been paid has not begun, the impact fee and any accrued interest thereon shall be returned to the applicant provided that the applicant applies for the refund in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the Building Permit or other approval (or any extension thereof) on which it was assessed. 
3.  The Town shall charge an administrative fee for verifying and computing the refund of three percent of the amount of the refund. 
K.   Offsets to Impact Fees
Offsets, which are reductions from the impact fee that would otherwise be due from a development , shall be subject to the following provisions. 
1.  The Planning Commission shall grant an offset only for qualifying improvements that are required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval after the effective date of the impact fee ordinance against which such offset is claimed. 
2.  Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees otherwise due for the same category of improvements and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the Town . 
3.  Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or the developer's predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same category for which an impact fee was imposed. 
4.  The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements , construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the offset claimed. The Planning Commission shall have no obligation to grant offsets to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the Planning Commission may reasonably require. 
5.  The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the Town ) as determined by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant , and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the Town disagrees with the appraised value, the Town may engage another appraiser at the Town's expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and the Town . The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties. 
6.  Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until ten years after the date of approval or until the last date of construction within the project, whichever occurs first. The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property within the development for which the qualifying improvement was required. 
7.  Any claim for offsets must be made no later than the time of submittal of a Building Permit application or application for another permit subsequent to Development Plan Approval that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
L.   Developer Agreements for Impact Fees
1.  Where a development includes or requires a qualifying improvement , the Town and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying improvement(s) . Such agreement may provide for cash reimbursements, offsets, or other appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer's participation in the financing and/or construction of the improvement(s) . 
2.  The agreement shall include: 
a.  The estimated cost of the qualifying improvement(s) , using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, which bid is approved by the Official ; or, if no bid is available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed South Carolina engineer and approved by the Official ; 
b.  A schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement(s); 
c.  A requirement that the improvement(s) be designed and completed in compliance with any applicable Town ordinances ; and, 
d.  Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Town . 
M.   Relief Procedures and Hearings
The developer who owes or has paid an impact fee may appeal the assessment or payment of the fee to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.T, Appeal of Administrative Decisions and Written Interpretations to Board of Zoning Appeals. 
N.   Fee Supplemental to Other Financing Methods
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees, or assessments imposed by the Town on development or the issuance of Building Permits or Certificates of Occupancy which are imposed on and due against property within the jurisdiction of the Town . Such fees are intended to be consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan , Capital Improvements Program , LMO, and other Town policies, ordinances , and resolutions by which the Town seeks to ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development . 
2.  In addition to the use of impact fees, the Town may finance qualifying capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. 
O.   Updates and Revisions of the Impact Fees
Not less often than every five years and to be tied to the Comprehensive Plan update, the Planning Commission , following a public hearing, shall review and, if warranted, recommend changes in the schedules of impact fees. Factors to be considered may include, without limitation, past and projected growth in residential and nonresidential development , qualifying improvements actually constructed, changing levels of service, revised cost estimates for qualifying improvements , changes in the availability of other funding sources, changes in demand generation characteristics, sources of non-Town funds, and such other factors as may be relevant.

Q.   Transportation Impact Fee Calculation
1.  At the option of the Official , the transportation impact fee may be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 4 below. 
2.  The Official shall determine the land use category that best represents the proposed use in terms of trip generation characteristics. Trip generation rates or equations and/or primary trip data contained in the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual ( ITE Manual ) shall be utilized. 
3.  The Official shall make the determination of the appropriate land use category, trip generation rate or equation and primary trip factor based on the appropriateness and quality of the data, the guidelines for determining whether to use trip generation rates or equations set forth in the ITE Manual , and other relevant considerations. 
4.  Calculation 
a.  FEE = One-Way ADT x Primary Trip Factor x Average Trip Length x Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile 
b.  WHERE: 
i.  "One-Way ADT" means one-half the average daily trip ends on a weekday. 
ii.  "Primary Trip Factor" means the percentage of average daily trips to or from the development that are primary trips, as opposed to pass-by or diverted-link trips. 
iii.  "Average Trip Length" means the average distance per trip traveled on public streets in the Town . The average trip length is 2.78 miles based on analysis of 1990 trip and travel data. This distance shall be used until updated using the Town 's transportation model, and this Ordinance is updated to reflect such re-calculation. 
iv.  "Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile" means the total cost of required future public street improvements at Town build-out divided by the projected number of new vehicle travel miles to be generated by new development . This cost shall be $61.38 per daily mile until this Ordinance is updated to reflect recalculation by the Town . 
R.   Individual Transportation Fee Assessments
Individual assessments of transportation impact fees shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  The traffic engineer or engineering firm to perform each individual assessment shall be selected by the applicant from a list of qualified traffic engineers or engineering firms maintained by the Town . The list of engineers shall be created through the solicitation by the Town of professional traffic engineers qualified to perform this service. The list shall contain the names of at least three traffic engineers or traffic engineering firms, along with statements of qualifications on each. The list shall be updated periodically by a committee appointed by the Planning Commission . 
2.  The traffic study shall be signed by the traffic engineer submitting the assessment and shall include, without limitation, the following elements: 
a.  A projection of the number of vehicular trips entering and departing from the project during an average weekday. 
b.  If the site is already developed, and some or all of the existing development will be replaced by the completed project, a calculation of the number of vehicular trips for that portion of the existing development that will be replaced by the completed project. 
c.  The percentage of those trips identified in paragraphs a and b above that are "primary trips" (as opposed to "pass-by trips" or "diverted-link trips" for which the project is not the primary destination). 
d.  The assumptions and conclusions from which any projections are made. If the assumptions or conclusions are derived from the current edition of the ITE Manual or other standard reference materials, the materials shall be identified and appropriate excerpts or specific references provided. Otherwise, the reasoning underlying the assumptions and conclusions shall be clearly stated in writing. 
e.  Such other information as the Official shall reasonably request. 
3.  Following action by the Planning Commission , the Official shall determine the fee based on the review of the independent assessment and the guidelines and formula described above. 
S.   Use of Transportation Impact Fees
1.  The revenues from transportation impact fees collected within the benefit district and accrued interest on such revenues shall be used to finance project costs of qualifying transportation improvements , as determined by the Town Council , provided that the improvements are shown on the Capital Improvements Program and are located within the same benefit district. 
2.  Qualifying transportation improvements include: 
a.  Project engineering costs; 
b.  The acquisition cost of rights-of-way and easements , including legal costs; 
c.  The construction cost of improvements —including, but not limited to, public street travel lanes, public pedestrian and bicycle pathways, turning lanes or the portion thereof located within the right-of-way of a public street , lighting, signalization, signage, and landscaping improvements —that are required for the transportation improvement to function effectively; and 
d.  The principal, interest, and other financing costs of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town to finance qualified improvements . 
3.  Such revenues may also fund the cost of consultants used in updating the transportation portion of the Capital Improvements Program and in updating the fee computations. 
4.  Monies collected as transportation impact fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following: 
a.  Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than qualifying transportation improvements ; 
b.  Repair , operation, or maintenance of existing or new public street or pathway improvements ; 
c.  Town personnel and consultants hired for purposes other than those expressly permitted under paragraphs a and b above; and 
d.  Streets , pathways, and related transportation improvements that are within and intended to serve only a specific development such as a new residential subdivision .

Specifically, this section is intended to supplement the State's stormwater management program and standards with additional standards that ensure control of the volume and flow of stormwater runoff, limit pollutants in stormwater runoff, provide opportunities for the filtering and settling of pollutants from runoff before it enters the ground water and surface waters, and minimize erosion and sedimentation from stormwater runoff. 
B.   Applicability
1.   General
This section applies to all land disturbing activity that disturbs ½ acre or greater of land and all development that is within ½ mile of coastal receiving waters , regardless of disturbed area. Additionally, this section applies to any project or activity that is part of a Larger Common Plan , regardless of size. Exceptions to these requirements are listed in subsection 2. below. 
2.   Exceptions
The following activities are exempt from the standards in this section: 
a.  Development exempt from Development Plan Review in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.G.3, Exemptions, with the exception of public street or minor utility construction; 
b.  The establishment of, or additions or modifications to, a single-family dwelling or its accessory structure , provided that such development shall be subject to all standards in Sec. 16-5-109.I, Erosion and Sedimentation Control, except the requirement to submit an erosion control plan (Such development is also subject to the flood damage control standards in Chapter 9 of Title 15 of the Municipal Code , and must conform to the grading scheme and finished floor elevation established by the approved Development Plan.); 
c.  Maintenance and repair of public streets , pathways, storm drainage, or similar public infrastructure subject to government maintenance ; 
d.  New or existing agricultural activity (as defined in Sec. 16-10-105, General Definitions) not involving the filling or drainage of land ; and 
e.  Emergency work by agencies or property owners required to address flooding conditions, provided: 
i.  Such work is verbally approved by the Official or other duly appointed official in charge of emergency preparedness or emergency relief if practicable ( property owners performing emergency work will be responsible for any damage or injury to persons or property caused by their unauthorized actions); 
ii.  The Official or other duly appointed official who verbally approved the action delivers written notice of the action to the landowner and any affected agency at the earliest possible time; and 
iii.  Property owners performing emergency work restore the site of the emergency work within 60 days following the end of the emergency period. 
(Revised 6-6-2017 - Ordinance 2017-08 ) 
C.   General Standards for Stormwater Management
1.   Compliance with State and Federal Stormwater Management Standards
All development shall comply with the stormwater management standards of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC) and any applicable federal stormwater standards and permits (e.g., NPDES permits), unless such standards are waived by the appropriate State or federal agency. 
2.   Compliance with Maximum Impervious Cover Standards
All development shall comply with the maximum impervious cover standards applicable to the zoning district in which the development is located (see Chapter 16-3: Zoning Districts). (See definition of impervious surface in Sec. 16-10-105, General Definitions.) 
3.   Compliance with OCRM Critical Area Permitting Requirements
For development adjacent to the OCRM Critical Line, all stormwater management facilities located in the critical areas shall obtain a permit from the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) prior to installation. 
4.   No Increased Flood Potential
Development shall not appreciably increase the flood potential within the development , on adjacent or surrounding lands , or on tidal or freshwater wetlands, as determined by the Town Engineer. 
5.   No High-Maintenance Facilities
Development shall not incorporate structures and facilities that the Town Engineer determines will demand considerable maintenance . 
6.   Discharges onto Beaches and into Wetlands and Water Bodies
a.  No stormwater discharge shall be permitted onto beaches . 
b.  No direct stormwater discharge shall be permitted into tidal or freshwater wetlands unless approved by the Town Engineer. 
c.  Discharging stormwater runoff directly into water bodies from impervious areas shall not be allowed unless methods are provided to filter the runoff to the maximum extent practicable . Such methods include filtering runoff through sheet flow, grass swales, drywells, infiltration ditches, gravel, sand, or other filter mediums before the runoff leaves the site or enters any natural or shared-in-common manmade water body. 
7.   Alteration of Water Bodies
Dredging, clearing, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing, or otherwise altering water bodies may be permitted by the Town Engineer only when a positive benefit can be demonstrated. Such approval does not obviate the need for other applicable Town , State , or federal agency approvals. 
8.   Water Surface Elevation Alteration and Adjustment
a.  No development shall construct, establish, maintain, or permanently alter the surface water elevation of any water body or wetland so as to adversely affect the natural drainage from any upstream areas, or to any downstream areas, of the drainage basin . 
b.  The water surface elevations proposed for lagoons or water bodies are subject to approval by the Town Engineer as part of the development review process. The applicant shall submit sufficient ground water , topographic elevation data, and hydrologic data on or around the proposed water body site to assist in establishing the water surface elevation. 
9.   Reference Guides
The standards and design guidelines as set forth in the latest editions of the Beaufort County Manual for Storm Water Best Management and Design Practices , the South Carolina DHEC's Stormwater Management BMP Handbook , and the Georgia Coastal Stormwater Supplement shall serve as guides to technical specifications for the design and construction of various types of stormwater management facilities (including, but not limited to, structural and nonstructural stormwater best management practices (BMPs) and maintenance standards). 
10.   Pre-Design Conference
A pre-design conference with the Town Engineer or his or her designee is suggested for small projects not affecting major drainage ways or environmentally sensitive areas, and is required for all Subdivision Review and Development Plan Review applications . 
11.   Professional Engineer or Surveyor
All surveys, plans, specifications, and reports shall be prepared and certified by the appropriate professional engineer or professional surveyor registered in South Carolina, in accordance with the current South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 40-Professions and Occupations, Chapter 22, Engineers and Surveyors. 
D.   Drainage Design Standards
1.   General
a.   Design Methodology
i.  The two accepted hydrological methodologies for computing surface runoff are the rational method and the USDA NRCS TR-55 method. Other methods approved by the Town Engineer are allowable. 
ii.  The rational method may be used only for sizing individual culverts or storm drains that are not part of a pipe network or system and have a contributing drainage area of 20 acres or less. 
iii.  The USDA NRCS TR-55 method or other approved methodology may be used for sites of any size. 
iv.  Proposed development design shall consider the hydrological features within the total watershed, including the development site, upstream and downstream areas. 
b.   Site Area
The site area incorporated in stormwater management design shall be the total area of proposed development , including any noncontiguous lands that are part of a Planned Development, which is owned in fee simple by the landowner / developer of the Planned Development, or is included in perpetual cross easements for drainage purposes. 
c.   Design Storm
The design storm, to be used in the design of all drainage systems and permanent stormwater management facilities, is the 25-year frequency/24-hour/8.4-Inch rainfall and Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC II). 
d.   Engineering Checklist
Detailed design standards for all stormwater management systems required by this section can be found in the Engineering Checklist maintained by the Town Engineer. 
2.   Pre-Development Peak Discharge Rates
a.  All development shall incorporate stormwater management facilities sufficient to ensure that for the design storm and Type III rainfall distribution, the post- development peak discharge rate across adjacent property lines will not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rate. In the case of redevelopment, the pre-development condition shall be defined as the existing state at the time of development application . 
b.  Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) shall be used to retain and detain the increased and accelerated runoff that the development generates. 
c.  The Town Engineer may waive this peak discharge requirement on determining that the applicant has demonstrated that: 
i.  A suitable means of flow into a downstream tidal discharge point is accessible; or 
ii.  The development includes a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site flows to an ultimate downstream tidal discharge point. 
3.   On-Site Retention of First Inch of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site retention (dry or wet) or percolation of a minimum of one inch of runoff from on-site impervious surfaces . Major drainage canals may not be used for retention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  The one inch of runoff from all such impervious surfaces shall be dissipated by percolation into the soil, evaporation, or other methods of treatment or handling acceptable to the Town Engineer. 
c.  Where on-site retention of runoff is also required by OCRM standards, evidence of OCRM approval of the on-site retention shall be submitted to the Town Engineer. 
4.   On-Site Detention or Percolation of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation of stormwater runoff that is sufficient to maintain the same peak discharge rate as occurred pre-development. Major drainage canals may not be used for detention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  Off-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation areas may be used, provided: 
i.  The Town Engineer determines that such improvements are in the common good and are of satisfactory design to cause no hardship to others utilizing the same drainageway, whether on-site or upstream or downstream; 
ii.  A recorded, permanent drainage easement is provided that complies with this section and Sec. 16-5-109.G, Drainage Easements, and benefits the land described in the application for development permit; 
iii.  Adequate maintenance of the areas is provided for in accordance with Sec. 16-5-109.H.1, Ownership and Maintenance Responsibility; and 
iv.  The developer bears the total cost of the areas and their detention or percolation facilities. 
5.   Design of Detention and Retention Facilities
a.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed to provide at least one-half foot of freeboard or vertical detention storage volume for runoff above the design storm peak elevation. 
b.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed for ten-year sediment loads before the one-half foot storage volume required in subparagraph a above is included. Sediment storage may be accommodated below the dry weather water level design, as long as an adequate permanent pool depth is maintained. 
c.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed with relatively flat side slopes (maximum horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:1) along the shoreline. 
d.  Where possible, detention and retention facilities shall be designed with meandering shorelines to increase the length of shoreline, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation for pollution control purposes. 
e.  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the banks shall be sloped to the proposed dry weather water surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted for approval. 
6.   Adequate Outfall
A developer shall provide adequate outfall ditches, pipes, and easements downstream from a proposed discharge if public or private facilities adequate to carry the proposed discharge do not exist or are not available for use by the developer . 
7.   Use of Wetlands
a.  The use of wetlands for stormwater retention is allowable with approval by the Town Engineer. Adjacent BMPs that benefit from retention of normal wetland water table elevations are acceptable. 
b.  Regulated wetlands shall not be disturbed by the construction of BMPs in them or sufficiently near to deprive them of required runoff or to lower their normal water table elevations. 
c.  If a BMP is proposed to be located near a regulated wetland or in a required wetland buffer (see Sec. 16-6-102, Wetland Protection), the applicant will provide data showing that impacts will not be detrimental to the wetland or wetland buffer , and the BMPs shall include flow dissipation devices ensuring that discharge to wetlands occurs at non-erosive velocities. 
8.   Incorporation of Stormwater Management into Landscape Design
Final landscape designs and plantings shall not adversely affect stormwater conveyance or maintenance of stormwater management facilities, but rather should further opportunities for percolation, retention, detention , filtration, and plant absorption of site-generated stormwater runoff (e.g., using low impact development (LID) measures—see guides in Sec. 16-5-109.C.9, Reference Guides). 
E.   Inspection and Certification of Construction
The application for a Certificate of Compliance for a development , or approved phase thereof, shall include certification by a professional engineer registered in South Carolina that the development site work was constructed in accordance with approved plans and the requirements of this Ordinance . Prior to approval of such application , the Town Engineer or his or her designee shall conduct an inspection of constructed stormwater management facilities. Any deficiencies identified by the inspection shall be corrected before a Certificate of Compliance is issued. 
F.   As-Built Survey
1.  Before issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, the applicant shall submit to the Town Engineer an as-built survey prepared and certified by a South Carolina professional land surveyor that accurately identifies and depicts the horizontal location of all property corners, easements , and the horizontal and vertical locations of all on-site improvements . The as-built survey shall show: 
a.  Closed polygons of all impervious areas ( buildings , sidewalks, parking facilities, paved areas), utilities, storm drainage structures , pipes, channels, and detention /retention areas; 
b.  The diameter and type of material for all new storm drainage pipes; 
c.  All storm drainage structures , grate/rim, and invert elevations, along with finish grades on pavements and curbing as per the design plans (with design elevations to be struck through and the actual as-built elevations to be underlined and shown directly above or below the design elevation). 
2.  The as-built survey shall be clearly labeled and based on NAD 83, NAD 83 State Plane South Carolina Feet Intl, and NAVD 88 datums. 
3.  The as-built survey shall be submitted in the form of two sets of hard copy, sealed prints at a legible scale, and the digital file in AutoCAD 2007 format or newer. 
G.   Drainage Easements
1.   General
Developments shall provide adequate access for maintenance and improvement of the drainage easement and required stormwater management facilities. 
2.   Closed Pipe Easements
Generally, the minimum width of a drainage easement with underground storm drain pipes shall be at least 15 feet. The Town Engineer may require additional width as necessary to allow for access by service equipment and storage of removed fill to one side of the pipes, or to accommodate larger or more deeply buried pipes. 
3.   Open Channel Easements
Drainage easements for open drainage channels shall have a minimum width equal to the maximum top width of the channel plus an additional 15 feet. The Town Engineer may require additional width as necessary to allow for access by service equipment to one side of the channel. 
4.   Shared Easements
Drainage easements may be shared with other easements with the written approval of the Town Engineer and with consent of the easement holders. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the use of drainage easements for access to various properties or other compatible uses with the consent of the landowners and easement holders. 
H.   Maintenance of Stormwater Management Facilities and Easements
All required drainage easements and stormwater management facilities shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions in this subsection. 
1.   Ownership and Maintenance Responsibility
a.  The applicant shall designate what specific entity or entities will own and be responsible for operation and maintenance of drainage easements and required stormwater management facilities. Specific entities may include, but are not limited to, the Town , the developer or a homeowners' or property owners' association or regime. 
b.  For systems conveying runoff from a public street right-of-way, the applicant shall dedicate permanent drainage easements to the Town . 
c.  Any stormwater management facility serving a single- lot commercial or single- lot industrial development shall be privately owned and maintained. 
d.  Private maintenance of drainage easements and stormwater management systems shall be provided for in restrictive covenants (e.g., through reference to the operation and maintenance agreement required in paragraph 2 below). 
e.  Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, all required drainage easements and restrictive covenants ensuring maintenance of drainage easements and stormwater management facilities shall be recorded with the Beaufort County Register of Deeds. 
2.   Operation and Maintenance Agreement

Subdivisions creating lots to which public sanitary sewer is unavailable shall demonstrate that all such lots are sized to accommodate septic systems. Such systems shall be set back from property lines, approved by SCDHEC, and located within septic easements recorded with the subdivision plat. 
Sec.16-5-116.   Impact Fees
A.   Purpose
This section is intended to ensure timely construction of off-site public capital improvements that are necessary to serve new development by ensuring that necessary financing is available for such improvements . The impact fees to be paid by each new development in accordance with this section is to be proportional to the impact that the new development will have on the types of facilities for which the fees are charged. 
B.   Applicability
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all development , unless otherwise provided herein. 
1.  The movement of a structure onto a lot shall be considered development and shall be subject to these impact fee provisions, unless otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 below. 
2.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to the following actions: 
a.  The movement of a manufactured home onto a lot or parcel for use as a residence that does not result in a net increase in the number of manufactured home sites on the Island; 
b.  Placing on a lot in the Town a temporary construction trailer or office, but only for the life of the Building Permit issued for the construction served by the trailer or office; 
c.  Converting an existing structure from one use to another; and 
d.  Any development , including but not limited to the mere subdivision of land , installation of utilities, or the use of land for limited recreational, agricultural, filling or dredging purposes, which, in the opinion of the Official , will not result in a net increase of more than one one-way ADT. 
3.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to public projects. 
C.   Impact Fee Benefit District
1.  There shall be one impact fee benefit district that encompasses the entire Town . 
2.  The appropriateness of the designation and boundaries of the benefit district shall be reviewed by the Town as part of the impact fee revision process set forth below. Following such review and a public hearing, the benefit district may be amended. 
3.  Impact fees collected within the benefit district shall be spent within the benefit district. 
D.   Payment of Impact Fee as Condition of Approval
Until any impact fee required by this section has been paid in full, no Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to Development Plan Review for any development that is not exempted by Sec. 16-5-116.B, Applicability, shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. 
E.   Calculation of Fees Using Fee Schedule
Impact fees shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  Unless an applicant requests an administrative determination or individual assessment as set forth in the following subsections, the impact fees shall be calculated for the proposed development based on the Development Plan Approval or permit allowing the use , according to the applicable fee schedule. 
2.  The following impact fee schedules are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference: 
a.  Transportation Impact Fee Schedule 
3.  The units of development specified in the fee schedule shall be interpreted as follows: 
a.  A hotel "room" shall include any space that is part of the same rental unit and that does not have a separate entrance. 
b.  Building square footage shall be measured in terms of gross floor area . 
4.  For categories of uses not specified in the applicable impact fee schedule, the Official shall apply the category of use set forth in the applicable fee schedule that is deemed to be most similar to the proposed use . 
5.  If the Development Plan Approval or permit for the proposed development indicates a mix of uses in the development , the impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use according to the fee schedule, and the results aggregated. 
6.  For an addition to or replacement of existing structures , the impact fee to be paid shall be the difference, if any, between: 
a.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for existing development on the site or, in the case of demolition or removal of a structure , the previous development on the site , provided that the demolition or removal occurred after October 23, 1989, or within ten years of the date of submittal of the application for which impact fees are assessed, whichever is less; and 
b.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for the total development on the site after the new development . 
7.  Upon written request of an applicant , the Official shall provide an estimate of the current fee based on the data provided by the applicant . However, the Official shall not be responsible for determining at such preliminary date the accuracy of the information provided. 
F.   Individual Assessment of Impact Fees
1.  If any person submitting an application for which payment of an impact fee is a prerequisite to approval believes that the impacts of the proposed development will be substantially less than would be indicated by using a strict interpretation of the fee schedule or an administrative determination of the fee, such person may request that the Town perform an individual assessment of the impact of the proposed development , consistent with the methodology set forth in paragraph 2 below. A request for an individual assessment must be made prior to submittal of an application for a Building Permit . 
2.  The individual assessment shall be subject to the Transportation Impact Fees as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.R, Individual Transportation Fee Assessments. 
3.  The Town shall accept the calculations of the individual assessment if the Planning Commission finds at a public meeting that: 
a.  The proposed development is in fact so unique in the impacts it will generate that the strict application of the fee schedule or administrative determination would result in inaccurate impact projections; and 
b.  The individual assessment results in a fee which differs by at least five percent from the fees calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
4.  If the Town accepts the computations of the individual assessment under this section, the applicable fee shall be determined from the individual assessment, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the fee calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
G.   Collection of Impact Fees
The collection of impact fees shall be as follows: 
1.  Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the impact fees for all new development shall be calculated and collected in conjunction with the application for the first Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan for such development , whichever occurs first in time. 
2.  For other uses not ultimately requiring a Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan, the fee shall be calculated and collected at the time of approval of the Development Plan. 
H.   Fund Accounting for Impact Fees
1.  The Town shall establish a separate accounting fund in which the impact fees collected for a particular type of facility within the benefit district shall be credited. Such fees shall be invested by the Town and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the Town , shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the Town . Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. 
2.  Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for such fund. 
3.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for such accounting fund showing the revenues to such fund and the disbursements from such fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town . 
I.   Expenditure of Impact Fees
Transportation Impact Fees shall only be spent on qualifying public street and pathway improvements , as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees. 
J.   Refunds of Impact Fees
1.  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected in accordance with this section that has not been committed for a use permitted by Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees, within six years from the last day of the fiscal year in which it was received by the Town , shall be refunded to the current record owner of the property upon written application . Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" when they have been spent or encumbered by contract. Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" in the order in which they are received and committed by the Town . The refund shall include accrued interest at the rate of return on investments earned by the Town on such amount. In disbursing such funds the Town may rely on the written certification of the current record owner of the property as to his or her entitlement to the refund, in the absence of a written assertion by another party that such proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in doubt, the Town may deposit such funds in an appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In such event, the Town may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable cost of causing the funds to be deposited with the court, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
2.  If development for which an impact fee has been paid has not begun, the impact fee and any accrued interest thereon shall be returned to the applicant provided that the applicant applies for the refund in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the Building Permit or other approval (or any extension thereof) on which it was assessed. 
3.  The Town shall charge an administrative fee for verifying and computing the refund of three percent of the amount of the refund. 
K.   Offsets to Impact Fees
Offsets, which are reductions from the impact fee that would otherwise be due from a development , shall be subject to the following provisions. 
1.  The Planning Commission shall grant an offset only for qualifying improvements that are required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval after the effective date of the impact fee ordinance against which such offset is claimed. 
2.  Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees otherwise due for the same category of improvements and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the Town . 
3.  Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or the developer's predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same category for which an impact fee was imposed. 
4.  The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements , construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the offset claimed. The Planning Commission shall have no obligation to grant offsets to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the Planning Commission may reasonably require. 
5.  The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the Town ) as determined by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant , and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the Town disagrees with the appraised value, the Town may engage another appraiser at the Town's expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and the Town . The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties. 
6.  Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until ten years after the date of approval or until the last date of construction within the project, whichever occurs first. The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property within the development for which the qualifying improvement was required. 
7.  Any claim for offsets must be made no later than the time of submittal of a Building Permit application or application for another permit subsequent to Development Plan Approval that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
L.   Developer Agreements for Impact Fees
1.  Where a development includes or requires a qualifying improvement , the Town and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying improvement(s) . Such agreement may provide for cash reimbursements, offsets, or other appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer's participation in the financing and/or construction of the improvement(s) . 
2.  The agreement shall include: 
a.  The estimated cost of the qualifying improvement(s) , using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, which bid is approved by the Official ; or, if no bid is available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed South Carolina engineer and approved by the Official ; 
b.  A schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement(s); 
c.  A requirement that the improvement(s) be designed and completed in compliance with any applicable Town ordinances ; and, 
d.  Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Town . 
M.   Relief Procedures and Hearings
The developer who owes or has paid an impact fee may appeal the assessment or payment of the fee to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.T, Appeal of Administrative Decisions and Written Interpretations to Board of Zoning Appeals. 
N.   Fee Supplemental to Other Financing Methods
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees, or assessments imposed by the Town on development or the issuance of Building Permits or Certificates of Occupancy which are imposed on and due against property within the jurisdiction of the Town . Such fees are intended to be consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan , Capital Improvements Program , LMO, and other Town policies, ordinances , and resolutions by which the Town seeks to ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development . 
2.  In addition to the use of impact fees, the Town may finance qualifying capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. 
O.   Updates and Revisions of the Impact Fees
Not less often than every five years and to be tied to the Comprehensive Plan update, the Planning Commission , following a public hearing, shall review and, if warranted, recommend changes in the schedules of impact fees. Factors to be considered may include, without limitation, past and projected growth in residential and nonresidential development , qualifying improvements actually constructed, changing levels of service, revised cost estimates for qualifying improvements , changes in the availability of other funding sources, changes in demand generation characteristics, sources of non-Town funds, and such other factors as may be relevant.

Q.   Transportation Impact Fee Calculation
1.  At the option of the Official , the transportation impact fee may be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 4 below. 
2.  The Official shall determine the land use category that best represents the proposed use in terms of trip generation characteristics. Trip generation rates or equations and/or primary trip data contained in the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual ( ITE Manual ) shall be utilized. 
3.  The Official shall make the determination of the appropriate land use category, trip generation rate or equation and primary trip factor based on the appropriateness and quality of the data, the guidelines for determining whether to use trip generation rates or equations set forth in the ITE Manual , and other relevant considerations. 
4.  Calculation 
a.  FEE = One-Way ADT x Primary Trip Factor x Average Trip Length x Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile 
b.  WHERE: 
i.  "One-Way ADT" means one-half the average daily trip ends on a weekday. 
ii.  "Primary Trip Factor" means the percentage of average daily trips to or from the development that are primary trips, as opposed to pass-by or diverted-link trips. 
iii.  "Average Trip Length" means the average distance per trip traveled on public streets in the Town . The average trip length is 2.78 miles based on analysis of 1990 trip and travel data. This distance shall be used until updated using the Town 's transportation model, and this Ordinance is updated to reflect such re-calculation. 
iv.  "Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile" means the total cost of required future public street improvements at Town build-out divided by the projected number of new vehicle travel miles to be generated by new development . This cost shall be $61.38 per daily mile until this Ordinance is updated to reflect recalculation by the Town . 
R.   Individual Transportation Fee Assessments
Individual assessments of transportation impact fees shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  The traffic engineer or engineering firm to perform each individual assessment shall be selected by the applicant from a list of qualified traffic engineers or engineering firms maintained by the Town . The list of engineers shall be created through the solicitation by the Town of professional traffic engineers qualified to perform this service. The list shall contain the names of at least three traffic engineers or traffic engineering firms, along with statements of qualifications on each. The list shall be updated periodically by a committee appointed by the Planning Commission . 
2.  The traffic study shall be signed by the traffic engineer submitting the assessment and shall include, without limitation, the following elements: 
a.  A projection of the number of vehicular trips entering and departing from the project during an average weekday. 
b.  If the site is already developed, and some or all of the existing development will be replaced by the completed project, a calculation of the number of vehicular trips for that portion of the existing development that will be replaced by the completed project. 
c.  The percentage of those trips identified in paragraphs a and b above that are "primary trips" (as opposed to "pass-by trips" or "diverted-link trips" for which the project is not the primary destination). 
d.  The assumptions and conclusions from which any projections are made. If the assumptions or conclusions are derived from the current edition of the ITE Manual or other standard reference materials, the materials shall be identified and appropriate excerpts or specific references provided. Otherwise, the reasoning underlying the assumptions and conclusions shall be clearly stated in writing. 
e.  Such other information as the Official shall reasonably request. 
3.  Following action by the Planning Commission , the Official shall determine the fee based on the review of the independent assessment and the guidelines and formula described above. 
S.   Use of Transportation Impact Fees
1.  The revenues from transportation impact fees collected within the benefit district and accrued interest on such revenues shall be used to finance project costs of qualifying transportation improvements , as determined by the Town Council , provided that the improvements are shown on the Capital Improvements Program and are located within the same benefit district. 
2.  Qualifying transportation improvements include: 
a.  Project engineering costs; 
b.  The acquisition cost of rights-of-way and easements , including legal costs; 
c.  The construction cost of improvements —including, but not limited to, public street travel lanes, public pedestrian and bicycle pathways, turning lanes or the portion thereof located within the right-of-way of a public street , lighting, signalization, signage, and landscaping improvements —that are required for the transportation improvement to function effectively; and 
d.  The principal, interest, and other financing costs of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town to finance qualified improvements . 
3.  Such revenues may also fund the cost of consultants used in updating the transportation portion of the Capital Improvements Program and in updating the fee computations. 
4.  Monies collected as transportation impact fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following: 
a.  Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than qualifying transportation improvements ; 
b.  Repair , operation, or maintenance of existing or new public street or pathway improvements ; 
c.  Town personnel and consultants hired for purposes other than those expressly permitted under paragraphs a and b above; and 
d.  Streets , pathways, and related transportation improvements that are within and intended to serve only a specific development such as a new residential subdivision .  
Sec.16-5-109. - Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Standards 
A.   Purpose
The purpose of the standards in this section is to ensure that developments incorporate best management practices to minimize and manage stormwater runoff so as to control flooding, protect the quality of the ground and surface waters within and surrounding the Town , and minimize erosion and sedimentation. Specifically, this section is intended to supplement the State's stormwater management program and standards with additional standards that ensure control of the volume and flow of stormwater runoff, limit pollutants in stormwater runoff, provide opportunities for the filtering and settling of pollutants from runoff before it enters the ground water and surface waters, and minimize erosion and sedimentation from stormwater runoff. 
B.   Applicability
1.   General
This section applies to all land disturbing activity that disturbs ½ acre or greater of land and all development that is within ½ mile of coastal receiving waters , regardless of disturbed area. Additionally, this section applies to any project or activity that is part of a Larger Common Plan , regardless of size. Exceptions to these requirements are listed in subsection 2. below. 
2.   Exceptions
The following activities are exempt from the standards in this section: 
a.  Development exempt from Development Plan Review in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.G.3, Exemptions, with the exception of public street or minor utility construction; 
b.  The establishment of, or additions or modifications to, a single-family dwelling or its accessory structure , provided that such development shall be subject to all standards in Sec. 16-5-109.I, Erosion and Sedimentation Control, except the requirement to submit an erosion control plan (Such development is also subject to the flood damage control standards in Chapter 9 of Title 15 of the Municipal Code , and must conform to the grading scheme and finished floor elevation established by the approved Development Plan.); 
c.  Maintenance and repair of public streets , pathways, storm drainage, or similar public infrastructure subject to government maintenance ; 
d.  New or existing agricultural activity (as defined in Sec. 16-10-105, General Definitions) not involving the filling or drainage of land ; and 
e.  Emergency work by agencies or property owners required to address flooding conditions, provided: 
i.  Such work is verbally approved by the Official or other duly appointed official in charge of emergency preparedness or emergency relief if practicable ( property owners performing emergency work will be responsible for any damage or injury to persons or property caused by their unauthorized actions); 
ii.  The Official or other duly appointed official who verbally approved the action delivers written notice of the action to the landowner and any affected agency at the earliest possible time; and 
iii.  Property owners performing emergency work restore the site of the emergency work within 60 days following the end of the emergency period. 
(Revised 6-6-2017 - Ordinance 2017-08 ) 
C.   General Standards for Stormwater Management
1.   Compliance with State and Federal Stormwater Management Standards
All development shall comply with the stormwater management standards of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC) and any applicable federal stormwater standards and permits (e.g., NPDES permits), unless such standards are waived by the appropriate State or federal agency. 
2.   Compliance with Maximum Impervious Cover Standards
All development shall comply with the maximum impervious cover standards applicable to the zoning district in which the development is located (see Chapter 16-3: Zoning Districts). (See definition of impervious surface in Sec. 16-10-105, General Definitions.) 
3.   Compliance with OCRM Critical Area Permitting Requirements
For development adjacent to the OCRM Critical Line, all stormwater management facilities located in the critical areas shall obtain a permit from the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) prior to installation. 
4.   No Increased Flood Potential
Development shall not appreciably increase the flood potential within the development , on adjacent or surrounding lands , or on tidal or freshwater wetlands, as determined by the Town Engineer. 
5.   No High-Maintenance Facilities
Development shall not incorporate structures and facilities that the Town Engineer determines will demand considerable maintenance . 
6.   Discharges onto Beaches and into Wetlands and Water Bodies
a.  No stormwater discharge shall be permitted onto beaches . 
b.  No direct stormwater discharge shall be permitted into tidal or freshwater wetlands unless approved by the Town Engineer. 
c.  Discharging stormwater runoff directly into water bodies from impervious areas shall not be allowed unless methods are provided to filter the runoff to the maximum extent practicable . Such methods include filtering runoff through sheet flow, grass swales, drywells, infiltration ditches, gravel, sand, or other filter mediums before the runoff leaves the site or enters any natural or shared-in-common manmade water body. 
7.   Alteration of Water Bodies
Dredging, clearing, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing, or otherwise altering water bodies may be permitted by the Town Engineer only when a positive benefit can be demonstrated. Such approval does not obviate the need for other applicable Town , State , or federal agency approvals. 
8.   Water Surface Elevation Alteration and Adjustment
a.  No development shall construct, establish, maintain, or permanently alter the surface water elevation of any water body or wetland so as to adversely affect the natural drainage from any upstream areas, or to any downstream areas, of the drainage basin . 
b.  The water surface elevations proposed for lagoons or water bodies are subject to approval by the Town Engineer as part of the development review process.

D.   Drainage Design Standards
1.   General
a.   Design Methodology
i.  The two accepted hydrological methodologies for computing surface runoff are the rational method and the USDA NRCS TR-55 method. Other methods approved by the Town Engineer are allowable. 
ii.  The rational method may be used only for sizing individual culverts or storm drains that are not part of a pipe network or system and have a contributing drainage area of 20 acres or less. 
iii.  The USDA NRCS TR-55 method or other approved methodology may be used for sites of any size. 
iv.  Proposed development design shall consider the hydrological features within the total watershed, including the development site, upstream and downstream areas. 
b.   Site Area
The site area incorporated in stormwater management design shall be the total area of proposed development , including any noncontiguous lands that are part of a Planned Development, which is owned in fee simple by the landowner / developer of the Planned Development, or is included in perpetual cross easements for drainage purposes. 
c.   Design Storm
The design storm, to be used in the design of all drainage systems and permanent stormwater management facilities, is the 25-year frequency/24-hour/8.4-Inch rainfall and Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC II). 
d.   Engineering Checklist
Detailed design standards for all stormwater management systems required by this section can be found in the Engineering Checklist maintained by the Town Engineer. 
2.   Pre-Development Peak Discharge Rates
a.  All development shall incorporate stormwater management facilities sufficient to ensure that for the design storm and Type III rainfall distribution, the post- development peak discharge rate across adjacent property lines will not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rate. In the case of redevelopment, the pre-development condition shall be defined as the existing state at the time of development application . 
b.  Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) shall be used to retain and detain the increased and accelerated runoff that the development generates. 
c.  The Town Engineer may waive this peak discharge requirement on determining that the applicant has demonstrated that: 
i.  A suitable means of flow into a downstream tidal discharge point is accessible; or 
ii.  The development includes a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site flows to an ultimate downstream tidal discharge point. 
3.   On-Site Retention of First Inch of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site retention (dry or wet) or percolation of a minimum of one inch of runoff from on-site impervious surfaces . Major drainage canals may not be used for retention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  The one inch of runoff from all such impervious surfaces shall be dissipated by percolation into the soil, evaporation, or other methods of treatment or handling acceptable to the Town Engineer. 
c.  Where on-site retention of runoff is also required by OCRM standards, evidence of OCRM approval of the on-site retention shall be submitted to the Town Engineer. 
4.   On-Site Detention or Percolation of Runoff
a.  All development shall provide for on-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation of stormwater runoff that is sufficient to maintain the same peak discharge rate as occurred pre-development. Major drainage canals may not be used for detention where doing so may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. 
b.  Off-site detention (dry or wet) or percolation areas may be used, provided: 
i.  The Town Engineer determines that such improvements are in the common good and are of satisfactory design to cause no hardship to others utilizing the same drainageway, whether on-site or upstream or downstream; 
ii.  A recorded, permanent drainage easement is provided that complies with this section and Sec. 16-5-109.G, Drainage Easements, and benefits the land described in the application for development permit; 
iii.  Adequate maintenance of the areas is provided for in accordance with Sec. 16-5-109.H.1, Ownership and Maintenance Responsibility; and 
iv.  The developer bears the total cost of the areas and their detention or percolation facilities. 
5.   Design of Detention and Retention Facilities
a.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed to provide at least one-half foot of freeboard or vertical detention storage volume for runoff above the design storm peak elevation. 
b.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed for ten-year sediment loads before the one-half foot storage volume required in subparagraph a above is included. Sediment storage may be accommodated below the dry weather water level design, as long as an adequate permanent pool depth is maintained. 
c.  Detention and retention facilities shall be designed with relatively flat side slopes (maximum horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:1) along the shoreline. 
d.  Where possible, detention and retention facilities shall be designed with meandering shorelines to increase the length of shoreline, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation for pollution control purposes. 
e.  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the banks shall be sloped to the proposed dry weather water surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted for approval. 
6.   Adequate Outfall
A developer shall provide adequate outfall ditches, pipes, and easements downstream from a proposed discharge if public or private facilities adequate to carry the proposed discharge do not exist or are not available for use by the developer . 
7.   Use of Wetlands
a.  The use of wetlands for stormwater retention is allowable with approval by the Town Engineer. Adjacent BMPs that benefit from retention of normal wetland water table elevations are acceptable. 
b.  Regulated wetlands shall not be disturbed by the construction of BMPs in them or sufficiently near to deprive them of required runoff or to lower their normal water table elevations. 
c.  If a BMP is proposed to be located near a regulated wetland or in a required wetland buffer (see Sec. 16-6-102, Wetland Protection), the applicant will provide data showing that impacts will not be detrimental to the wetland or wetland buffer , and the BMPs shall include flow dissipation devices ensuring that discharge to wetlands occurs at non-erosive velocities. 
8.   Incorporation of Stormwater Management into Landscape Design
Final landscape designs and plantings shall not adversely affect stormwater conveyance or maintenance of stormwater management facilities, but rather should further opportunities for percolation, retention, detention , filtration, and plant absorption of site-generated stormwater runoff (e.g., using low impact development (LID) measures—see guides in Sec. 16-5-109.C.9, Reference Guides). 
E.   Inspection and Certification of Construction
The application for a Certificate of Compliance for a development , or approved phase thereof, shall include certification by a professional engineer registered in South Carolina that the development site work was constructed in accordance with approved plans and the requirements of this Ordinance .

Sec.16-5-115.   Subdivision Standards
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of subdivision layout is to create a functional and attractive development with infrastructure and lots appropriately sized and located to minimize adverse impacts. The intent of this section is to provide clear requirements and guidelines for subdivision design for both Major and Minor Subdivisions. Subdivisions should promote the health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and welfare of the present and future residents of the Town by: 
a.  Providing for the orderly growth and development of the Town ; 
b.  Coordinating with the existing street system, transportation plans, and public facilities; 
c.  Providing right-of-way for street and vehicular easements ; 
d.  Avoiding congestion and overcrowding and encouraging proper arrangement of streets in relation to existing planned streets ; 
e.  Ensuring there is adequate open space and recreation facilities; and 
f.  Ensuring there is proper recordation of land ownership. 
B.   Applicability
Subdivisions shall comply with all applicable design and performance standards of this section and this Ordinance , including the adjacent setback and buffer standards in Sec. 16-5-102 and 16-5-103. 
C.   General Requirements
1.  Layout of the subdivision shall be based on complete site analysis. Streets and lots shall be designed and situated to minimize alteration of natural and historic site features to be preserved. 
2.  The subdivision layout shall consider the practicality and economic feasibility of development of individual lots including the environmental characteristics, size of the site , and the requirements of this Ordinance . 
3.  Unique and fragile elements including, but not limited to wetlands, significant stands of trees and individual trees of significant size, shall be preserved where practical, with development reserved for environmentally stable areas. 
4.  Open space and recreational areas shall be planned in accordance with Sec. 16-5-104, Open Space Standards. 
5.  Lots shall be situated so that stormwater may be easily directed away from buildings in subsequent site -specific development . Lots shall be configured so that buildings and general flood sensitive site facilities can be located out of drainageways. Subdivisions shall be designed so as to comply with Sec. 16-5-109, Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Standards. 
6.  All lots shall have the access required by Sec. 16-5-105.I, Access to Streets. 
D.   Layout of Lots and Blocks
1.  Subdivisions may be laid out in conventional, cluster, or a combination of block/ lot designs. 
2.  The lot configuration and shape shall provide appropriate sites for buildings , and be properly related to topography, natural elements, access , drainage and utilities, and conform to all requirements of this Ordinance . 
3.  The dimensions of corner lots shall permit the required minimum setbacks from streets (see Sec. 16-5-102, Setback Standards) and required site triangles (see Sec. 16-5-105.H.4, Sight Triangles). 
4.  The number of lots within a block shall be as appropriate for the location and the type of development contemplated, as practical. Visual monotony created by excessive blocks of lots which are not interrupted by intersections, open space , buffers or features shall be avoided. 
5.  Pathways and sidewalks are encouraged throughout the subdivision . Pathways and sidewalks may be required by the Official to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping, or other community facilities. Interconnection with other pathways and sidewalks is also desirable. 
E.   Street Access
1.  All Major Subdivisions shall have direct vehicular access to a public street that meets the standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
2.  Minor Subdivisions shall be permitted to provide vehicular access to lots via a minimum 20-foot wide unobstructed access easement, provided the access easement complies with the following standards: 
a.  Access easements shall contain an all-weather driving surface approved by the Fire Chief for the Town of Hilton Head Island. 
b.  Dead-end easements shall have a turn-around as required by the latest edition of the International Fire Code as adopted by Town Council . 
c.  No access easement shall be permitted to exceed a maximum traffic volume of 50 ADT due to the further subdivision of lots without upgrading the accessway to meet the design standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
d.  Access easements are not allowed in any wetland buffer required by Sec. 16-6-102.D, Wetland Buffer Standards, except for approximately perpendicular crossings as approved by the Official . 
e.  A bridge may be permitted within an access easement as long as the driving surface is at least 20 feet wide and is approved by the Fire Chief of the Town of Hilton Head Island. 
F.   Miscellaneous Standards
1.   Monuments and Markers
a.  Horizontal control monuments shall be placed in the pavement of subdivision streets so that no lot is more than 2,000 feet from a control monument. Alternatively, control monuments may be placed in open space areas, park areas, and the like. The control monument shall be placed in a manner satisfactory to the Town Engineer. 
b.  Corner monuments or markers shall be installed at all lot corners. 
c.  All corner monuments or markers shall consist of a concrete marker with metal cap marking the exact corner and bearing the name of the surveying company or the land surveyor in responsible charge of the survey. If the corner location falls on pavement, concrete, or other material where it cannot be marked with a cap, a shaft of ferrous metal (iron pipe or bar), spikes, or scribes may be installed in or on the surface. These methods shall be used unless exceptional circumstances warrant the use of other materials. 
d.  If a corner cannot be monumented or marked, one or more witness monuments shall be placed on the boundary line and described by bearings or distances so that the inaccessible point may be located accurately on the ground. A witness monument shall adhere to the same standards applicable to a corner monument. 
2.   Addressing and Lot Numbering
The Official shall determine a method of street addressing/ lot numbering. Applicants should consult with the Town for site -specific review. 
3.   Lots with Septic Systems
Subdivisions creating lots to which public sanitary sewer is unavailable shall demonstrate that all such lots are sized to accommodate septic systems. Such systems shall be set back from property lines, approved by SCDHEC, and located within septic easements recorded with the subdivision plat. 
Sec.16-5-116.   Impact Fees
A.   Purpose
This section is intended to ensure timely construction of off-site public capital improvements that are necessary to serve new development by ensuring that necessary financing is available for such improvements . The impact fees to be paid by each new development in accordance with this section is to be proportional to the impact that the new development will have on the types of facilities for which the fees are charged. 
B.   Applicability
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all development , unless otherwise provided herein. 
1.  The movement of a structure onto a lot shall be considered development and shall be subject to these impact fee provisions, unless otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 below. 
2.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to the following actions: 
a.  The movement of a manufactured home onto a lot or parcel for use as a residence that does not result in a net increase in the number of manufactured home sites on the Island; 
b.  Placing on a lot in the Town a temporary construction trailer or office, but only for the life of the Building Permit issued for the construction served by the trailer or office; 
c.  Converting an existing structure from one use to another; and 
d.  Any development , including but not limited to the mere subdivision of land , installation of utilities, or the use of land for limited recreational, agricultural, filling or dredging purposes, which, in the opinion of the Official , will not result in a net increase of more than one one-way ADT. 
3.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to public projects. 
C.   Impact Fee Benefit District
1.  There shall be one impact fee benefit district that encompasses the entire Town . 
2.  The appropriateness of the designation and boundaries of the benefit district shall be reviewed by the Town as part of the impact fee revision process set forth below. Following such review and a public hearing, the benefit district may be amended. 
3.  Impact fees collected within the benefit district shall be spent within the benefit district. 
D.   Payment of Impact Fee as Condition of Approval
Until any impact fee required by this section has been paid in full, no Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to Development Plan Review for any development that is not exempted by Sec. 16-5-116.B, Applicability, shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. 
E.   Calculation of Fees Using Fee Schedule
Impact fees shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  Unless an applicant requests an administrative determination or individual assessment as set forth in the following subsections, the impact fees shall be calculated for the proposed development based on the Development Plan Approval or permit allowing the use , according to the applicable fee schedule. 
2.  The following impact fee schedules are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference: 
a.  Transportation Impact Fee Schedule 
3.  The units of development specified in the fee schedule shall be interpreted as follows: 
a.  A hotel "room" shall include any space that is part of the same rental unit and that does not have a separate entrance. 
b.  Building square footage shall be measured in terms of gross floor area . 
4.  For categories of uses not specified in the applicable impact fee schedule, the Official shall apply the category of use set forth in the applicable fee schedule that is deemed to be most similar to the proposed use . 
5.  If the Development Plan Approval or permit for the proposed development indicates a mix of uses in the development , the impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use according to the fee schedule, and the results aggregated. 
6.  For an addition to or replacement of existing structures , the impact fee to be paid shall be the difference, if any, between: 
a.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for existing development on the site or, in the case of demolition or removal of a structure , the previous development on the site , provided that the demolition or removal occurred after October 23, 1989, or within ten years of the date of submittal of the application for which impact fees are assessed, whichever is less; and 
b.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for the total development on the site after the new development . 
7.  Upon written request of an applicant , the Official shall provide an estimate of the current fee based on the data provided by the applicant . However, the Official shall not be responsible for determining at such preliminary date the accuracy of the information provided. 
F.   Individual Assessment of Impact Fees
1.  If any person submitting an application for which payment of an impact fee is a prerequisite to approval believes that the impacts of the proposed development will be substantially less than would be indicated by using a strict interpretation of the fee schedule or an administrative determination of the fee, such person may request that the Town perform an individual assessment of the impact of the proposed development , consistent with the methodology set forth in paragraph 2 below. A request for an individual assessment must be made prior to submittal of an application for a Building Permit . 
2.  The individual assessment shall be subject to the Transportation Impact Fees as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.R, Individual Transportation Fee Assessments. 
3.  The Town shall accept the calculations of the individual assessment if the Planning Commission finds at a public meeting that: 
a.  The proposed development is in fact so unique in the impacts it will generate that the strict application of the fee schedule or administrative determination would result in inaccurate impact projections; and 
b.  The individual assessment results in a fee which differs by at least five percent from the fees calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
4.  If the Town accepts the computations of the individual assessment under this section, the applicable fee shall be determined from the individual assessment, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the fee calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
G.   Collection of Impact Fees
The collection of impact fees shall be as follows: 
1.  Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the impact fees for all new development shall be calculated and collected in conjunction with the application for the first Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan for such development , whichever occurs first in time. 
2.  For other uses not ultimately requiring a Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan, the fee shall be calculated and collected at the time of approval of the Development Plan. 
H.   Fund Accounting for Impact Fees
1.  The Town shall establish a separate accounting fund in which the impact fees collected for a particular type of facility within the benefit district shall be credited. Such fees shall be invested by the Town and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the Town , shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the Town . Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. 
2.  Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for such fund. 
3.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for such accounting fund showing the revenues to such fund and the disbursements from such fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town . 
I.   Expenditure of Impact Fees
Transportation Impact Fees shall only be spent on qualifying public street and pathway improvements , as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees. 
J.   Refunds of Impact Fees
1.  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected in accordance with this section that has not been committed for a use permitted by Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees, within six years from the last day of the fiscal year in which it was received by the Town , shall be refunded to the current record owner of the property upon written application . Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" when they have been spent or encumbered by contract. Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" in the order in which they are received and committed by the Town . The refund shall include accrued interest at the rate of return on investments earned by the Town on such amount. In disbursing such funds the Town may rely on the written certification of the current record owner of the property as to his or her entitlement to the refund, in the absence of a written assertion by another party that such proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in doubt, the Town may deposit such funds in an appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In such event, the Town may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable cost of causing the funds to be deposited with the court, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
2.  If development for which an impact fee has been paid has not begun, the impact fee and any accrued interest thereon shall be returned to the applicant provided that the applicant applies for the refund in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the Building Permit or other approval (or any extension thereof) on which it was assessed. 
3.  The Town shall charge an administrative fee for verifying and computing the refund of three percent of the amount of the refund. 
K.   Offsets to Impact Fees
Offsets, which are reductions from the impact fee that would otherwise be due from a development , shall be subject to the following provisions. 
1.  The Planning Commission shall grant an offset only for qualifying improvements that are required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval after the effective date of the impact fee ordinance against which such offset is claimed. 
2.  Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees otherwise due for the same category of improvements and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the Town . 
3.  Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or the developer's predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same category for which an impact fee was imposed. 
4.  The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements , construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the offset claimed. The Planning Commission shall have no obligation to grant offsets to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the Planning Commission may reasonably require. 
5.  The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the Town ) as determined by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant , and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the Town disagrees with the appraised value, the Town may engage another appraiser at the Town's expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and the Town . The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties. 
6.  Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until ten years after the date of approval or until the last date of construction within the project, whichever occurs first. The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property within the development for which the qualifying improvement was required. 
7.  Any claim for offsets must be made no later than the time of submittal of a Building Permit application or application for another permit subsequent to Development Plan Approval that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
L.   Developer Agreements for Impact Fees
1.  Where a development includes or requires a qualifying improvement , the Town and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying improvement(s) . Such agreement may provide for cash reimbursements, offsets, or other appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer's participation in the financing and/or construction of the improvement(s) . 
2.  The agreement shall include: 
a.  The estimated cost of the qualifying improvement(s) , using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, which bid is approved by the Official ; or, if no bid is available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed South Carolina engineer and approved by the Official ; 
b.  A schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement(s); 
c.  A requirement that the improvement(s) be designed and completed in compliance with any applicable Town ordinances ; and, 
d.  Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Town . 
M.   Relief Procedures and Hearings
The developer who owes or has paid an impact fee may appeal the assessment or payment of the fee to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.T, Appeal of Administrative Decisions and Written Interpretations to Board of Zoning Appeals. 
N.   Fee Supplemental to Other Financing Methods
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees, or assessments imposed by the Town on development or the issuance of Building Permits or Certificates of Occupancy which are imposed on and due against property within the jurisdiction of the Town . Such fees are intended to be consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan , Capital Improvements Program , LMO, and other Town policies, ordinances , and resolutions by which the Town seeks to ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development . 
2.  In addition to the use of impact fees, the Town may finance qualifying capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. 
O.   Updates and Revisions of the Impact Fees
Not less often than every five years and to be tied to the Comprehensive Plan update, the Planning Commission , following a public hearing, shall review and, if warranted, recommend changes in the schedules of impact fees. Factors to be considered may include, without limitation, past and projected growth in residential and nonresidential development , qualifying improvements actually constructed, changing levels of service, revised cost estimates for qualifying improvements , changes in the availability of other funding sources, changes in demand generation characteristics, sources of non-Town funds, and such other factors as may be relevant.

Q.   Transportation Impact Fee Calculation
1.  At the option of the Official , the transportation impact fee may be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 4 below. 
2.  The Official shall determine the land use category that best represents the proposed use in terms of trip generation characteristics. Trip generation rates or equations and/or primary trip data contained in the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual ( ITE Manual ) shall be utilized. 
3.  The Official shall make the determination of the appropriate land use category, trip generation rate or equation and primary trip factor based on the appropriateness and quality of the data, the guidelines for determining whether to use trip generation rates or equations set forth in the ITE Manual , and other relevant considerations. 
4.  Calculation 
a.  FEE = One-Way ADT x Primary Trip Factor x Average Trip Length x Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile 
b.  WHERE: 
i.  "One-Way ADT" means one-half the average daily trip ends on a weekday. 
ii.  "Primary Trip Factor" means the percentage of average daily trips to or from the development that are primary trips, as opposed to pass-by or diverted-link trips. 
iii.  "Average Trip Length" means the average distance per trip traveled on public streets in the Town . The average trip length is 2.78 miles based on analysis of 1990 trip and travel data. This distance shall be used until updated using the Town 's transportation model, and this Ordinance is updated to reflect such re-calculation. 
iv.  "Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile" means the total cost of required future public street improvements at Town build-out divided by the projected number of new vehicle travel miles to be generated by new development . This cost shall be $61.38 per daily mile until this Ordinance is updated to reflect recalculation by the Town . 
R.   Individual Transportation Fee Assessments
Individual assessments of transportation impact fees shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  The traffic engineer or engineering firm to perform each individual assessment shall be selected by the applicant from a list of qualified traffic engineers or engineering firms maintained by the Town . The list of engineers shall be created through the solicitation by the Town of professional traffic engineers qualified to perform this service. The list shall contain the names of at least three traffic engineers or traffic engineering firms, along with statements of qualifications on each. The list shall be updated periodically by a committee appointed by the Planning Commission . 
2.  The traffic study shall be signed by the traffic engineer submitting the assessment and shall include, without limitation, the following elements: 
a.  A projection of the number of vehicular trips entering and departing from the project during an average weekday. 
b.  If the site is already developed, and some or all of the existing development will be replaced by the completed project, a calculation of the number of vehicular trips for that portion of the existing development that will be replaced by the completed project. 
c.  The percentage of those trips identified in paragraphs a and b above that are "primary trips" (as opposed to "pass-by trips" or "diverted-link trips" for which the project is not the primary destination). 
d.  The assumptions and conclusions from which any projections are made. If the assumptions or conclusions are derived from the current edition of the ITE Manual or other standard reference materials, the materials shall be identified and appropriate excerpts or specific references provided. Otherwise, the reasoning underlying the assumptions and conclusions shall be clearly stated in writing. 
e.  Such other information as the Official shall reasonably request. 
3.  Following action by the Planning Commission , the Official shall determine the fee based on the review of the independent assessment and the guidelines and formula described above. 
S.   Use of Transportation Impact Fees
1.  The revenues from transportation impact fees collected within the benefit district and accrued interest on such revenues shall be used to finance project costs of qualifying transportation improvements , as determined by the Town Council , provided that the improvements are shown on the Capital Improvements Program and are located within the same benefit district. 
2.  Qualifying transportation improvements include: 
a.  Project engineering costs; 
b.  The acquisition cost of rights-of-way and easements , including legal costs; 
c.  The construction cost of improvements —including, but not limited to, public street travel lanes, public pedestrian and bicycle pathways, turning lanes or the portion thereof located within the right-of-way of a public street , lighting, signalization, signage, and landscaping improvements —that are required for the transportation improvement to function effectively; and 
d.  The principal, interest, and other financing costs of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town to finance qualified improvements . 
3.  Such revenues may also fund the cost of consultants used in updating the transportation portion of the Capital Improvements Program and in updating the fee computations. 
4.  Monies collected as transportation impact fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following: 
a.  Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than qualifying transportation improvements ; 
b.  Repair , operation, or maintenance of existing or new public street or pathway improvements ; 
c.  Town personnel and consultants hired for purposes other than those expressly permitted under paragraphs a and b above; and 
d.  Streets , pathways, and related transportation improvements that are within and intended to serve only a specific development such as a new residential subdivision .  
Sec.16-5-115. - Subdivision Standards

2.  The lot configuration and shape shall provide appropriate sites for buildings , and be properly related to topography, natural elements, access , drainage and utilities, and conform to all requirements of this Ordinance . 
3.  The dimensions of corner lots shall permit the required minimum setbacks from streets (see Sec. 16-5-102, Setback Standards) and required site triangles (see Sec. 16-5-105.H.4, Sight Triangles). 
4.  The number of lots within a block shall be as appropriate for the location and the type of development contemplated, as practical. Visual monotony created by excessive blocks of lots which are not interrupted by intersections, open space , buffers or features shall be avoided. 
5.  Pathways and sidewalks are encouraged throughout the subdivision . Pathways and sidewalks may be required by the Official to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping, or other community facilities. Interconnection with other pathways and sidewalks is also desirable. 
E.   Street Access
1.  All Major Subdivisions shall have direct vehicular access to a public street that meets the standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
2.  Minor Subdivisions shall be permitted to provide vehicular access to lots via a minimum 20-foot wide unobstructed access easement, provided the access easement complies with the following standards: 
a.  Access easements shall contain an all-weather driving surface approved by the Fire Chief for the Town of Hilton Head Island. 
b.  Dead-end easements shall have a turn-around as required by the latest edition of the International Fire Code as adopted by Town Council . 
c.  No access easement shall be permitted to exceed a maximum traffic volume of 50 ADT due to the further subdivision of lots without upgrading the accessway to meet the design standards of Sec. 16-5-105.C, General Street Design Standards. 
d.  Access easements are not allowed in any wetland buffer required by Sec. 16-6-102.D, Wetland Buffer Standards, except for approximately perpendicular crossings as approved by the Official .

Alternatively, control monuments may be placed in open space areas, park areas, and the like. The control monument shall be placed in a manner satisfactory to the Town Engineer. 
b.  Corner monuments or markers shall be installed at all lot corners. 
c.  All corner monuments or markers shall consist of a concrete marker with metal cap marking the exact corner and bearing the name of the surveying company or the land surveyor in responsible charge of the survey. If the corner location falls on pavement, concrete, or other material where it cannot be marked with a cap, a shaft of ferrous metal (iron pipe or bar), spikes, or scribes may be installed in or on the surface. These methods shall be used unless exceptional circumstances warrant the use of other materials. 
d.  If a corner cannot be monumented or marked, one or more witness monuments shall be placed on the boundary line and described by bearings or distances so that the inaccessible point may be located accurately on the ground. A witness monument shall adhere to the same standards applicable to a corner monument. 
2.   Addressing and Lot Numbering
The Official shall determine a method of street addressing/ lot numbering. Applicants should consult with the Town for site -specific review. 
3.   Lots with Septic Systems
Subdivisions creating lots to which public sanitary sewer is unavailable shall demonstrate that all such lots are sized to accommodate septic systems. Such systems shall be set back from property lines, approved by SCDHEC, and located within septic easements recorded with the subdivision plat.  
Sec.16-5-116. - Impact Fees 
A.   Purpose
This section is intended to ensure timely construction of off-site public capital improvements that are necessary to serve new development by ensuring that necessary financing is available for such improvements . The impact fees to be paid by each new development in accordance with this section is to be proportional to the impact that the new development will have on the types of facilities for which the fees are charged. 
B.   Applicability
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all development , unless otherwise provided herein. 
1.  The movement of a structure onto a lot shall be considered development and shall be subject to these impact fee provisions, unless otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 below. 
2.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to the following actions: 
a.  The movement of a manufactured home onto a lot or parcel for use as a residence that does not result in a net increase in the number of manufactured home sites on the Island; 
b.  Placing on a lot in the Town a temporary construction trailer or office, but only for the life of the Building Permit issued for the construction served by the trailer or office; 
c.  Converting an existing structure from one use to another; and 
d.  Any development , including but not limited to the mere subdivision of land , installation of utilities, or the use of land for limited recreational, agricultural, filling or dredging purposes, which, in the opinion of the Official , will not result in a net increase of more than one one-way ADT. 
3.  The impact fee provisions shall not apply to public projects. 
C.   Impact Fee Benefit District
1.  There shall be one impact fee benefit district that encompasses the entire Town . 
2.  The appropriateness of the designation and boundaries of the benefit district shall be reviewed by the Town as part of the impact fee revision process set forth below. Following such review and a public hearing, the benefit district may be amended. 
3.  Impact fees collected within the benefit district shall be spent within the benefit district. 
D.   Payment of Impact Fee as Condition of Approval
Until any impact fee required by this section has been paid in full, no Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to Development Plan Review for any development that is not exempted by Sec. 16-5-116.B, Applicability, shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. 
E.   Calculation of Fees Using Fee Schedule
Impact fees shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  Unless an applicant requests an administrative determination or individual assessment as set forth in the following subsections, the impact fees shall be calculated for the proposed development based on the Development Plan Approval or permit allowing the use , according to the applicable fee schedule. 
2.  The following impact fee schedules are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference: 
a.  Transportation Impact Fee Schedule 
3.  The units of development specified in the fee schedule shall be interpreted as follows: 
a.  A hotel "room" shall include any space that is part of the same rental unit and that does not have a separate entrance. 
b.  Building square footage shall be measured in terms of gross floor area . 
4.  For categories of uses not specified in the applicable impact fee schedule, the Official shall apply the category of use set forth in the applicable fee schedule that is deemed to be most similar to the proposed use . 
5.  If the Development Plan Approval or permit for the proposed development indicates a mix of uses in the development , the impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use according to the fee schedule, and the results aggregated. 
6.  For an addition to or replacement of existing structures , the impact fee to be paid shall be the difference, if any, between: 
a.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for existing development on the site or, in the case of demolition or removal of a structure , the previous development on the site , provided that the demolition or removal occurred after October 23, 1989, or within ten years of the date of submittal of the application for which impact fees are assessed, whichever is less; and 
b.  The fee, if any, that would be payable for the total development on the site after the new development . 
7.  Upon written request of an applicant , the Official shall provide an estimate of the current fee based on the data provided by the applicant . However, the Official shall not be responsible for determining at such preliminary date the accuracy of the information provided. 
F.   Individual Assessment of Impact Fees
1.  If any person submitting an application for which payment of an impact fee is a prerequisite to approval believes that the impacts of the proposed development will be substantially less than would be indicated by using a strict interpretation of the fee schedule or an administrative determination of the fee, such person may request that the Town perform an individual assessment of the impact of the proposed development , consistent with the methodology set forth in paragraph 2 below. A request for an individual assessment must be made prior to submittal of an application for a Building Permit . 
2.  The individual assessment shall be subject to the Transportation Impact Fees as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.R, Individual Transportation Fee Assessments. 
3.  The Town shall accept the calculations of the individual assessment if the Planning Commission finds at a public meeting that: 
a.  The proposed development is in fact so unique in the impacts it will generate that the strict application of the fee schedule or administrative determination would result in inaccurate impact projections; and 
b.  The individual assessment results in a fee which differs by at least five percent from the fees calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
4.  If the Town accepts the computations of the individual assessment under this section, the applicable fee shall be determined from the individual assessment, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the fee calculated under the fee schedule or administrative determination. 
G.   Collection of Impact Fees
The collection of impact fees shall be as follows: 
1.  Except as set forth in the following paragraph, the impact fees for all new development shall be calculated and collected in conjunction with the application for the first Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan for such development , whichever occurs first in time. 
2.  For other uses not ultimately requiring a Building Permit , Electrical Permit, Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or other permit subsequent to approval of a Development Plan, the fee shall be calculated and collected at the time of approval of the Development Plan. 
H.   Fund Accounting for Impact Fees
1.  The Town shall establish a separate accounting fund in which the impact fees collected for a particular type of facility within the benefit district shall be credited. Such fees shall be invested by the Town and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the Town , shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the Town . Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. 
2.  Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for such fund. 
3.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for such accounting fund showing the revenues to such fund and the disbursements from such fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town . 
I.   Expenditure of Impact Fees
Transportation Impact Fees shall only be spent on qualifying public street and pathway improvements , as set forth in Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees. 
J.   Refunds of Impact Fees
1.  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected in accordance with this section that has not been committed for a use permitted by Sec. 16-5-116.S, Use of Transportation Impact Fees, within six years from the last day of the fiscal year in which it was received by the Town , shall be refunded to the current record owner of the property upon written application . Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" when they have been spent or encumbered by contract. Impact fees shall be deemed to be "committed" in the order in which they are received and committed by the Town . The refund shall include accrued interest at the rate of return on investments earned by the Town on such amount. In disbursing such funds the Town may rely on the written certification of the current record owner of the property as to his or her entitlement to the refund, in the absence of a written assertion by another party that such proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in doubt, the Town may deposit such funds in an appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In such event, the Town may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable cost of causing the funds to be deposited with the court, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
2.  If development for which an impact fee has been paid has not begun, the impact fee and any accrued interest thereon shall be returned to the applicant provided that the applicant applies for the refund in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the Building Permit or other approval (or any extension thereof) on which it was assessed. 
3.  The Town shall charge an administrative fee for verifying and computing the refund of three percent of the amount of the refund. 
K.   Offsets to Impact Fees
Offsets, which are reductions from the impact fee that would otherwise be due from a development , shall be subject to the following provisions. 
1.  The Planning Commission shall grant an offset only for qualifying improvements that are required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval after the effective date of the impact fee ordinance against which such offset is claimed. 
2.  Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees otherwise due for the same category of improvements and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the Town . 
3.  Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or the developer's predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same category for which an impact fee was imposed. 
4.  The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements , construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the offset claimed. The Planning Commission shall have no obligation to grant offsets to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the Planning Commission may reasonably require. 
5.  The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the Town ) as determined by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant , and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the Town disagrees with the appraised value, the Town may engage another appraiser at the Town's expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and the Town . The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties. 
6.  Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until ten years after the date of approval or until the last date of construction within the project, whichever occurs first. The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property within the development for which the qualifying improvement was required. 
7.  Any claim for offsets must be made no later than the time of submittal of a Building Permit application or application for another permit subsequent to Development Plan Approval that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
L.   Developer Agreements for Impact Fees
1.  Where a development includes or requires a qualifying improvement , the Town and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying improvement(s) . Such agreement may provide for cash reimbursements, offsets, or other appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer's participation in the financing and/or construction of the improvement(s) . 
2.  The agreement shall include: 
a.  The estimated cost of the qualifying improvement(s) , using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, which bid is approved by the Official ; or, if no bid is available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed South Carolina engineer and approved by the Official ; 
b.  A schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement(s); 
c.  A requirement that the improvement(s) be designed and completed in compliance with any applicable Town ordinances ; and, 
d.  Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Town . 
M.   Relief Procedures and Hearings
The developer who owes or has paid an impact fee may appeal the assessment or payment of the fee to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Sec. 16-2-103.T, Appeal of Administrative Decisions and Written Interpretations to Board of Zoning Appeals. 
N.   Fee Supplemental to Other Financing Methods
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees, or assessments imposed by the Town on development or the issuance of Building Permits or Certificates of Occupancy which are imposed on and due against property within the jurisdiction of the Town . Such fees are intended to be consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan , Capital Improvements Program , LMO, and other Town policies, ordinances , and resolutions by which the Town seeks to ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development . 
2.  In addition to the use of impact fees, the Town may finance qualifying capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. 
O.   Updates and Revisions of the Impact Fees
Not less often than every five years and to be tied to the Comprehensive Plan update, the Planning Commission , following a public hearing, shall review and, if warranted, recommend changes in the schedules of impact fees. Factors to be considered may include, without limitation, past and projected growth in residential and nonresidential development , qualifying improvements actually constructed, changing levels of service, revised cost estimates for qualifying improvements , changes in the availability of other funding sources, changes in demand generation characteristics, sources of non-Town funds, and such other factors as may be relevant.

Q.   Transportation Impact Fee Calculation
1.  At the option of the Official , the transportation impact fee may be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 4 below. 
2.  The Official shall determine the land use category that best represents the proposed use in terms of trip generation characteristics. Trip generation rates or equations and/or primary trip data contained in the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual ( ITE Manual ) shall be utilized. 
3.  The Official shall make the determination of the appropriate land use category, trip generation rate or equation and primary trip factor based on the appropriateness and quality of the data, the guidelines for determining whether to use trip generation rates or equations set forth in the ITE Manual , and other relevant considerations. 
4.  Calculation 
a.  FEE = One-Way ADT x Primary Trip Factor x Average Trip Length x Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile 
b.  WHERE: 
i.  "One-Way ADT" means one-half the average daily trip ends on a weekday. 
ii.  "Primary Trip Factor" means the percentage of average daily trips to or from the development that are primary trips, as opposed to pass-by or diverted-link trips. 
iii.  "Average Trip Length" means the average distance per trip traveled on public streets in the Town . The average trip length is 2.78 miles based on analysis of 1990 trip and travel data. This distance shall be used until updated using the Town 's transportation model, and this Ordinance is updated to reflect such re-calculation. 
iv.  "Average Cost per Daily Travel Mile" means the total cost of required future public street improvements at Town build-out divided by the projected number of new vehicle travel miles to be generated by new development . This cost shall be $61.38 per daily mile until this Ordinance is updated to reflect recalculation by the Town . 
R.   Individual Transportation Fee Assessments
Individual assessments of transportation impact fees shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  The traffic engineer or engineering firm to perform each individual assessment shall be selected by the applicant from a list of qualified traffic engineers or engineering firms maintained by the Town . The list of engineers shall be created through the solicitation by the Town of professional traffic engineers qualified to perform this service. The list shall contain the names of at least three traffic engineers or traffic engineering firms, along with statements of qualifications on each. The list shall be updated periodically by a committee appointed by the Planning Commission . 
2.  The traffic study shall be signed by the traffic engineer submitting the assessment and shall include, without limitation, the following elements: 
a.  A projection of the number of vehicular trips entering and departing from the project during an average weekday. 
b.  If the site is already developed, and some or all of the existing development will be replaced by the completed project, a calculation of the number of vehicular trips for that portion of the existing development that will be replaced by the completed project. 
c.  The percentage of those trips identified in paragraphs a and b above that are "primary trips" (as opposed to "pass-by trips" or "diverted-link trips" for which the project is not the primary destination). 
d.  The assumptions and conclusions from which any projections are made. If the assumptions or conclusions are derived from the current edition of the ITE Manual or other standard reference materials, the materials shall be identified and appropriate excerpts or specific references provided. Otherwise, the reasoning underlying the assumptions and conclusions shall be clearly stated in writing. 
e.  Such other information as the Official shall reasonably request. 
3.  Following action by the Planning Commission , the Official shall determine the fee based on the review of the independent assessment and the guidelines and formula described above. 
S.   Use of Transportation Impact Fees
1.  The revenues from transportation impact fees collected within the benefit district and accrued interest on such revenues shall be used to finance project costs of qualifying transportation improvements , as determined by the Town Council , provided that the improvements are shown on the Capital Improvements Program and are located within the same benefit district. 
2.  Qualifying transportation improvements include: 
a.  Project engineering costs; 
b.  The acquisition cost of rights-of-way and easements , including legal costs; 
c.  The construction cost of improvements —including, but not limited to, public street travel lanes, public pedestrian and bicycle pathways, turning lanes or the portion thereof located within the right-of-way of a public street , lighting, signalization, signage, and landscaping improvements —that are required for the transportation improvement to function effectively; and 
d.  The principal, interest, and other financing costs of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town to finance qualified improvements . 
3.  Such revenues may also fund the cost of consultants used in updating the transportation portion of the Capital Improvements Program and in updating the fee computations. 
4.  Monies collected as transportation impact fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following: 
a.  Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than qualifying transportation improvements ; 
b.  Repair , operation, or maintenance of existing or new public street or pathway improvements ; 
c.  Town personnel and consultants hired for purposes other than those expressly permitted under paragraphs a and b above; and 
d.  Streets , pathways, and related transportation improvements that are within and intended to serve only a specific development such as a new residential subdivision .  
Chapter 16-6: - Natural Resource Protection 
 
Sec.16-6-101. - General 
A.   Purpose and Intent
The intent of this chapter is to establish standards to conserve or restore the natural resources that help define the character of Hilton Head Island and enhance the well-being of Island residents and visitors. Wetlands, dunes, beaches , and trees contribute substantially to the functioning of the Island's natural systems and processes, protection of wildlife habitat, water quality, control of flooding, community resiliency to natural hazards and disasters , and economic viability. 
B.   Applicability
Except as expressly provided otherwise, the standards in this chapter shall apply to all development in the territorial limits of the Town .  
Sec.16-6-102. - Wetland Protection 
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose and intent of the standards in this section are to protect and conserve natural wetlands that control flooding by absorbing and retaining flood waters, minimize erosion and sedimentation, maintain and enhance the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of open bodies of water, provide important wildlife habitat and native vegetation, and otherwise enhance the sustainability of the coastal island environment so important to the livability and economy of Hilton Head Island. The standards are intended to regulate development and activities in and around wetlands so as to: 
1.  Avoid the disturbance or alteration of wetlands wherever practicable; 
2.  Minimize any unavoidable alteration of wetlands; 
3.  Mitigate any loss of wetlands or wetland integrity by the revegetation or restoration of altered wetlands, creation of new wetlands, and conservation of existing wetlands; 
4.  Minimize erosion, sedimentation, and pollution of wetlands; 
5.  Limit the placement of fill in and excavation of wetlands; and 
6.  Provide buffers along the perimeter of wetlands that will protect the wetlands from impacts of adjacent development and allow for filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters wetlands, and allow for wetland views. 
B.   Applicability
1.  Except as expressly provided otherwise, the standards in this section shall apply to all development in the territorial limits of the Town . 
2.  Development within or adjacent to wetlands is also subject to State and federal regulations. 
3.  No person shall undertake any work in a wetland buffer without first receiving approval of a Natural Resources Permit in accordance with the procedures and standards of Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit, and the standards in this section. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
C.   General Performance Standards
1.  Fertilizers, pesticides, and other potential pollutants shall be prevented from directly entering into wetlands, whether by surface flow, ground water flow, or outfall structures . 
2.  During development , every precaution shall be taken to prevent the disruption of adjacent wetlands and open bodies of water. Siltation fences and other best-management practices shall be used at all times to minimize siltation, sedimentation, erosion, and disturbance of vegetation. 
3.  To ensure that sediment is not transported into adjacent wetlands or open bodies of water, erosion and sediment controls shall be left in place until filled areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation that will prevent the transport of sediment off the site of land-disturbing activities 
4.  When the use of fill is permitted, fill material shall be clean and shall not consist of garbage, refuse, toxic or contaminated material, or any material that through the actions of soil leaching may cause the degradation of surface or ground water quality. 
5.  Filling shall be limited to the minimum amount to achieve the purpose for which the fill is permitted. 
6.  Slopes resulting from the placement of fill shall be no steeper than a 3 to 1 (horizontal to vertical) ratio and shall be stabilized with vegetation to prevent erosion and sedimentation. The stabilization shall be completed at least 30 days before issuance of a Certificate of Compliance. The vegetation used for fill stabilization shall be maintained in a living condition. 
7.  Where wetlands are filled for street construction and culverts are deemed appropriate, a sufficient number of culverts shall be used to allow for the passage of water and maintain the natural hydrologic regime. 
D.   Wetland Buffer Standards
1.   Applicability
Wetland buffers shall be provided along the perimeter of all wetlands. 
2.   Wetland Buffer Width
a.  Wetland buffers shall comply with the average and minimum width standards in Table 16-6-102.D.2, Wetland Buffer Width, for the type of development and the type of wetland.> 
TABLE 16-6-102.D.2: WETLAND BUFFER WIDTH 1,2,3

1. Measured from the outer edge of the wetland, as certified in writing by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), a Town -approved wetlands consultant, or Ocean & Coastal Resource Management (OCRM). 
2. Average buffer width is determined by quantifying the buffer width for every 10-foot linear increment of pervious surface, impervious surface , or structure , as appropriate; summing these; and dividing the number of increments measured. Quantification of each increment of buffer shall be approved by the Official . 
3. Buildings, surface parking lots, and vehicular accessways shall be set back at least 5 feet beyond the outer edge of the wetland buffer . 
 
b.  The Official may authorize a reduction in the average or minimum wetland buffer width by up to ten percent on determining that pollution of the wetlands due to adjacent land disturbance is comparably reduced due to site-specific conditions (e.g., the buffer area drains away from the wetlands) or because the adjacent development is designed to reduce the flow, and maximize the filtration, of stormwater runoff towards the wetlands beyond the extent required by stormwater management regulations. 
3.   Development Within Wetland Buffers
a.   Prohibited Development Activities
The following activities are specifically prohibited in a wetland buffer unless expressly authorized in subparagraph b below or elsewhere in this Ordinance :

( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
(A)  Stormwater management facilities and utility lines that must cross the buffer shall do so at approximately a right angle to minimize the area of buffer width disturbed; and 
(B)  Stormwater management facilities and utility lines may run approximately parallel to the edge of the wetland if the utility or drainage easement allows the vegetation necessary to provide for significant filtration of stormwater runoff before it reaches the wetland; otherwise additional buffer width shall be required to provide the space for such filtration. 
08.  Water-dependent development activities such as docks, boat ramps , shoreline stabilization, and stream and wetland restoration ; 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
09.  Limited removal of: 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
(A)  Trees or other vegetation determined by the Official to be dead, dying, or diseased, provided the root system is retained intact; 
(B)  Non-native trees or other vegetation determined by the Official to constitute a threat to the growth or reintroduction of native species of vegetation; 
(C)  Fallen trees , tree limbs, brush, and similar debris that have accumulated in or along stream beds and are determined by the Official to substantially impede stream flow 
(D)  Fallen trees , tree limbs, and brush that are determined by the Official to impede pedestrian or bicycle traffic along approved multi-purpose pathways and pedestrian walkways. 
ii.  Any impervious surfaces shall either be sloped away from the wetland and stormwater runoff from them shall be routed over a greater distance for filtration purposes, or constructed or installed In accordance with an alternative filtration design approved by the Official as ensuring that the impervious surfaces do not adversely impact the natural functionally of the wetland buffer . 
iii.  The allowed development activity incorporates any additional measures the Official deems necessary to adequately protect the wetland's water quality and mitigate any loss of or damage to wildlife habitat or native plant communities. 
4.   View Corridors
Vegetation within wetland buffers may be removed or selectively pruned to establish view corridors to the wetlands, subject to the Official's determination of compliance with the following standards: 
a.  To the maximum extent practicable , view corridors shall be located where the least amount of native vegetation is required to be removed or pruned (i.e., where little vegetation exists or where existing vegetation is non-native), and the pruning of trees and vegetation adjacent to the corridor can be done in a manner that maintains the health of such trees and other vegetation. 
b.  No healthy specimen tree may be removed to create a view corridor. Selective pruning of trees (including specimen trees ) is allowed, in accordance with accepted International Society of Arboriculture practices. 
c.  Any trees removed shall be cut flush with existing grade and their root systems left intact. All removed vegetation shall be replaced with shrubs or other low-growing vegetation (not turf or sod) that will maximize the buffer's function in slowing runoff and removing pollutants before they reach the wetland system. 
E.   Wetland Alteration and Mitigation Requirements
1.   Wetland Alteration Allowed Only Where Unavoidable
a.  Alteration to a wetland shall be allowed only when the applicant clearly demonstrates that wetland alteration cannot be avoided. Wetland alteration shall be considered unavoidable only if there no feasible alternative layout or design that would avoid disturbance of wetland and still practically accomplish the overall basic purpose of the proposed development or activity, or if an overriding public interest in the alteration can be demonstrated. Examples of alternative layouts and design that might allow wetland alteration to be avoided include, but are not limited to: using wetland as required open space ; locating buildings , parking, and other disturbed areas in non-wetland areas; using existing wetland crossings for needed street or utility access to upland areas; renovating, remodeling, or expanding existing buildings rather than constructing new buildings ; using already disturbed areas as sites for new development ; and minimizing the footprint of buildings and parking areas (building "up" rather than "out"). 
b.  Where alteration to a wetland is allowed, any impact of the alteration on the wetland shall be minimized through the use of best management practices , re-design, innovative technology (e.g., pervious parking areas), preservation, and legal protection (e.g., deed restrictions, conservation easements ). 
c.  Any mitigation proposal to alter a wetland shall ensure that, upon completion, there will be no net loss to the wetland's values, functions, and area. 
2.   Mitigation Required for Altered Wetlands
a.  Where alteration of a wetland cannot be avoided, mitigation to compensate for the loss of wetland shall be required through any approved combination of wetland revegetation , wetland restoration , wetland creation , wetland preservation , wetland mitigation banking , or the payment of fees in lieu of mitigation, in accordance with the following standards. 
b.  The applicant shall demonstrate every effort to avoid and minimize the impact prior to pursuing mitigation through wetland revegetation , wetland restoration , wetland creation , wetland preservation , wetland mitigation banking , or the payment of fees in lieu of mitigation. 
3.   Minimum Mitigation Ratio
a.  Mitigation completed prior to grading or during construction of an approved development shall compensate for the altered wetland at a ratio of at least 1:1 (e.g., an acre of restored or created wetland for each acre of altered wetland). A higher mitigation ratio may be required based on the value of the altered wetland, or as required by OCRM. Although OCRM will accept upland buffers for wetland mitigation, this provision does not allow replacement of altered wetlands by upland buffers, since the goal is no net loss of wetland value, function, and area. 
b.  Mitigation completed post-construction for an approved development shall compensate for the altered wetland at a ratio of at least 3:1 (e.g., three acres of restored or created wetland for each acre of altered wetland). 
4.   Location of Mitigation
Wetland revegetation , restoration, creation, or preservation shall be provided on the site of the altered wetland wherever practical and beneficial to the wetland resources. If such mitigation cannot be provided on-site , it may be provided off-site , but only within a watershed on Hilton Head Island as identified on the Official Watershed Map. 
5.   Wetland Revegetation
Wetland revegetation involves the replanting of native vegetation in wetland areas where man-made changes have altered vegetation, but where wetland hydrologic and soil conditions have been retained. Wetland revegetation shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  All plants used for revegetation shall be native plants. Refer to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1988, National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands: 1988 National Summary, Biological Reports 88(24). 
b.  Revegetated areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment. 
c.  Trees and plants required herein shall be inspected over a three year period after installation to determine whether they are surviving in a healthy condition. If the trees or plants appear unable to promote healthy future growth, they shall be replaced by other native plants. 
d.  The size and species of vegetation shall be appropriate to the location being revegetated and the type of habitat being created, and shall be of the same species and diversity as that being removed. 
e.  All revegetation shall be done in accordance with best management practices . 
f.  Wetland restoration , enhancement, or creation may be permitted only where the proposed project exhibits that the hydrologic, soil, side slope, and other basic characteristics of the wetland are adequate to achieve the proposed project goals. 
g.  Wetland restoration or creation may be permitted to compensate for new wetland losses only where the restored or created wetland will be at least as persistent as the existing wetland system it is intended to replace. 
6.   Wetland Restoration
Wetland restoration involves the restoration of wetland conditions on lands altered by man-made changes in vegetation, hydrology, or soils. Areas suitable for wetland restoration include agricultural lands , mining sites , silvicultural lands , industrial sites , and other degraded wetland systems. Wetland restoration projects shall comply with the following standards. 
a.  The degraded nature of the system shall be documented by the applicant before a restoration plan can be considered. 
b.  A wetland restoration plan shall be submitted to demonstrate achievement of a long-term wetland hydrologic regime through the re-establishment of natural hydrophytic vegetation or the planting of hydrophytic vegetation species, as appropriate to the site . 
c.  The wetland restoration plan shall include a planting plan that identifies the species composition, sizes, plant spacing, and planting schedule for any new plants. 
d.  The wetland restoration plan shall include a monitoring program to ensure the success of the project. Success criteria include a predominance of hydrophytic plant species from natural regeneration or the reasonable growth of planted hydrophytic vegetation with a survival rate of at least 75 percent over a three-year establishment period. 
e.  Any problems detected during monitoring shall immediately be evaluated as to the cause and measures shall be taken to alleviate the problem or readjust the mitigation plan. A contingency plan shall be developed on how detected problems will be corrected to meet the success criteria. 
7.   Wetland Creation
Wetland creation involves the conversion of uplands into wetland systems. Sites suitable for wetland creation are prior converted wetlands, cut-overs, agricultural lands , or very young forest stands. Creation adjacent to existing wetlands may be beneficial to obtain hydrology. Wetland creation projects shall comply with the following standards. 
a.  A wetland creation plan designed by a qualified wetland consultant shall be submitted to demonstrate achievement of a long-term wetland hydrological regime through the creation of new wetlands. 
b.  The wetland creation plan shall include a planting plan that identifies the species composition, sizes, plant spacing, and planting schedule for any new plants. 
c.  If at all possible, hydric soils from a wetland area to be filled or excavated shall be used for the base soils of the created wetland. To provide a stock of seed and rhizomes to assist in vegetating the creation site , the creation site shall be excavated below grade and backfilled with the hydric topsoil to a depth of six to 16 inches. Usable hydric soils shall be moved and spread quickly. If hydric soils are not available, nonhydric topsoils shall be used. Under no circumstances shall bare sub-soil be used as a planting medium. 
d.  Vegetation shall match that being altered as to species, density , and diversity. 
e.  The wetland creation plan shall include a monitoring program to ensure the success of the project in terms of both vegetation and hydrology. The monitoring program shall be spelled out in a recorded memorandum of agreement and included as part of the conditions of approval. Unless otherwise established in the mitigation plan, success criteria include a predominance of hydrophytic plant species from natural regeneration or the reasonable growth of planted hydrophytic vegetation with a survival rate of at least 75 percent over a three-year establishment period. 
f.  Any problems detected during monitoring shall immediately be evaluated as to the cause and measures shall be taken to alleviate the problem or readjust the mitigation plan. A contingency plan shall also be developed on how detected problems will be corrected to meet the success criteria. The contingency plan shall be spelled out in the recorded memorandum of agreement and included as part of the conditions of approval. 
8.   Wetland Preservation
Wetland preservation involves the conservation of a wetland area in perpetuity through legal limitations on the use and disturbance of the area. Wetland preservation projects are allowed under the following conditions: 
a.  No more than 50 percent of required mitigation shall be in wetland preservation . 
b.  Total wetland area preserved shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.2 to obtain the amount eligible to be applied toward required mitigation. 
Example: If the mitigation requirement for asiteis 1.0 acre, then a maximum of 0.5 acres is eligible for mitigation through preservation. To obtain maximum credit for preservation mitigation in this case, at least 2.5 acres ofwetlandsand their associated upland buffers must be preserved through deed restrictions or conservationeasements(2.5 acres *0.2 adjustment = 0.5 acre credit). 
 
c.  Upland buffers shall be included in all preservation mitigation, but only wetland area shall be applied toward the mitigation requirement. 
9.   Wetland Mitigation Banking
Wetland mitigation banking involves the purchase of credits from an established mitigation bank for wetland area that has previously been restored, created, enhanced, or preserved on another site to compensate for wetland lost to development . Wetland mitigation banking is allowed under the following conditions: 
a.  The bank to be debited is within any watershed on Hilton Head Island as shown on the Official Watershed Map. 
b.  The mitigation bank to be debited has received federal and State approval prior to allowance of debits for wetlands impacts. 
10.   Payment of Fees in Lieu of Mitigation
If the applicant has made all reasonable efforts to mitigate altered wetland through wetland revegetation , restoration, creation, and preservation, and no mitigation bank credits are available, then the applicant may pay a fee to the Town in lieu of mitigation, subject to the following standards: 
a.  The fee shall be calculated by the Official based on the area of wetland altered but not mitigated in accordance with this subsection, the current cost of land in the watershed, and the cost of wetland mitigation design, construction , plant installation, and maintenance . 
b.  The fee shall be submitted to the Town prior to approval of a Development Plan for the development proposing the wetland alteration . 
c.  The Town shall establish a separate accounting fund in which the fees in lieu of wetland mitigation shall be deposited, subject to the following requirements: 
i.  Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. 
ii.  Any yield on the accounting fund shall accrue to that fund and be used for the purposes specified for the fund. 
iii.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for the accounting fund showing the revenues to, and disbursements from, the fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of the fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town . 
iv.  Fees in lieu of mitigation shall only be spent on qualifying wetland creation projects. Qualifying debits include land acquisition, design, construction , plant installation, and maintenance of wetland mitigation areas. 
11.   Maintenance and Monitoring
a.  For all mitigation projects, the Official shall require, at a minimum: 
i.  Maintenance of all plantings at a survival rate of at least 75 percent over a three-year establishment period; 
ii.  Replantings as necessary to maintain the required survival rate; and 
iii.  Removal of exotic species. 
b.  The applicant shall submit monitoring reports every six months for a three-year establishment period (unless otherwise established at the time of project approval). 
c.  These requirements shall be spelled out in a recorded memorandum of agreement and included as part of the conditions of approval. 
Sec.16-6-103.   Beach and Dune Protection
A.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this section is to protect, preserve, restore, and enhance the beach and dune systems that are so important to protecting life and property from storms, providing significant economic benefits through tourism, providing habitat for important plants and animals, providing a healthy environment for recreation, and improving the quality of life for citizens of and visitors to Hilton Head Island. 
B.   Applicability
1.  The standards in this section shall apply to all development . 
2.  If these standards conflict with standards in any Town-adopted shoreline management program, the standards in that program govern. 
3.  Development on beaches and dunes is also subject to State regulations administered by OCRM. 
4.  No person shall undertake any work in a dune or dune system without first receiving approval of a Natural Resources Permit in accordance with the procedures and standards of Sec. 16-2-103.K, Natural Resources Permit, and the standards in this section.

3.  Erosion control structures shall not interfere with existing or planned public access to the beach unless equivalent, alternate access can be provided. 
4.  Beach nourishment or construction of erosion control structures shall be done at times of the year when impact on wildlife, particularly endangered species, is minimized. Appropriate State and federal permits shall be secured before Town approval. 
E.   Beach Access Standards
1.  Pedestrian or bicycle access to beach areas shall be provided by elevated walkways with a two foot minimum clearance where dunes of any size or age exist or are to be restored. In no case shall direct vehicular access to beach areas be permitted unless specifically authorized by the Town . 
2.  In reviewing all development applications involving property adjacent to the beach , the Official shall consider the need for beach access to meet the general public interest. 
3.  The Official shall not approve any development on property adjacent to the beach that would cause the net loss of any existing officially designated beach access . 
F.   Development on Dunes
1.   General
No dune in an active beach system shall be leveled, breached, altered, or undermined in any way by development or other human-caused activity, and no dune vegetation may be disturbed or destroyed, except for: 
a.  The construction and maintenance of very limited elevated boardwalks with a two foot minimum clearance or similar beach access for handicap accessibility necessary for pedestrian and bicycle access to the beach , in accordance with the standards in paragraph 2 below and their associated wooden deck not larger than 144 square feet; 
b.  The establishment and maintenance of a view corridor in accordance with paragraph 3 below; 
c.  The planting of native, salt-tolerant vegetation or the placement and maintenance of wood-and-wire sand fences, where used to speed accumulation of sand for dune stabilization, restoration, or reconstruction; 
d.  The removal of non-native invasive vegetation, provided any trees removed shall be cut flush with existing grade and their root systems left intact; 
e.  The placement of informational signs , trash receptacles, and other similar minor structures serving persons accessing the beach ; 
f.  Tie-downs or anchors to existing minor structures or trees ; 
g.  Limited shore stabilization measures approved under the S.C. Beachfront Management Act; and 
h.  Temporary measures (e.g., sandbags, sand scraping) approved by the Town or OCRM to address an emergency situation. 
2.   Dune Boardwalks
All boardwalks constructed on dunes for pedestrian and bicycle access to the beach shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  Dune boardwalks shall be designed and sited to protect dune features, minimize disturbance of native dune vegetation, avoid lateral beach access , and minimize the amount of construction material that may become debris during a storm event. If removal or disturbance of native dune vegetation cannot be avoided, replacement vegetation in an equivalent amount shall be planted. 
b.  Dune boardwalks shall generally be constructed perpendicular to the shoreline and extend at least to the seaward toe of the primary dune . 
c.  Dune boardwalks constructed across existing or proposed native beach and dune vegetation shall be post-supported and elevated a minimum of two feet above the grade to allow for sand build-up and clearance above the vegetation. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
d.  Where possible, stairways and ramps leading from the dune crest down to the beach shall be designed to minimize the quantity of material used in construction . 
e.  Dune boardwalks shall not exceed an overall width of six feet unless otherwise permitted by SCDHEC-OCRM. Support posts shall not be encased in concrete or installed in dune slopes greater than 30 degrees. 
f.  Windblown sand may be removed from dune boardwalks . 
3.   View Corridors
Dune vegetation may be removed or selectively pruned to 4 feet to establish view corridors to the beach , in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  To the maximum extent practicable , view corridors shall be located where the least amount of native dune vegetation is required to be removed or pruned (i.e., where little dune vegetation exists or where existing vegetation is non-native), and the pruning of trees and vegetation adjacent to the corridor can be done in a manner that maintains the health of such trees and other vegetation. 
b.  No healthy specimen tree may be removed to create a view corridor. Selective pruning of trees (including specimen trees ) is allowed, in accordance with accepted International Society of Arboriculture practices. 
c.  Any trees removed shall be cut flush with existing grade and their root systems left intact. All removed vegetation shall be replaced with shrubs or other low-growing vegetation (not turf) that will enhance the stabilization of the dune system .

( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
ii.  The location of any trees with a DBH less than 6 inches (Category I, II and IV) less than 8 inches (cedar and palmetto trees ) and less than 12 inches (Category III other than cedar and palmetto trees ) that the applicant wishes to count toward the minimum standard of tree coverage on the site ; and 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
iii.  The species and DBH of all trees . 
b.  In conjunction with the tree survey , trees shall be marked with color ribbons, using blue ribbons to mark trees to be preserved, red ribbons for trees to be removed, and orange ribbons for hazardous trees that are proposed to be removed (hazardous trees will not count towards the overall required tree replacement). In heavily wooded areas, the Official may allow large groups of trees to be preserved or removed to be marked with the appropriately colored ribbon extending around the perimeter of the group of trees . 
D.   Pre-Construction Underbrushing
No underbrushing of property other than public utility easements shall occur before a building permit is issued unless approved by the Official as in compliance with this section. 
1.  Applicants for final development approval shall schedule an on-site inspection with the Official to explain the extent and purpose of the underbrushing activity. Purposes that will be considered justification for pre-development underbrushing activity include showing property for sale and facilitating surveying work in very densely vegetated areas. 
2.  In all cases, applicants shall be required to maintain all vegetation in required buffers except for a six-foot-wide path providing access to the interior of the property. Such buffer areas shall be clearly marked and protected prior to the commencement of the underbrushing activity. 
3.  The intent of this provision is to retain suitable species of native understory that can be incorporated into landscape plans and development plan approvals so as to conserve water, preserve indigenous plant species and dependent wildlife species, protect wildlife habitat, and save the applicant landscaping and irrigation costs. 
4.  Following the receipt of final development approval, the applicant shall work with the Official to preserve understory in the front and side buffers. 
5.  Any property owner who fails to abide by this restriction shall be required to restore the affected property to a condition as close to its original condition as practicable. 
6.  Exemption 
a.  Underbrushing on land by a property owner in zoning districts RM4, RM8; RM12, RS3, RS5, RS6, MF, MV, S, and WMU is exempt from the requirements of Section 16-6-104.D; however, all vegetation in required buffers shall be maintained except for a six-foot-wide path providing access to the interior of the property. Such buffer areas shall be clearly marked and protected prior to the commencement of the underbrushing activity. A Natural Resources Permit shall be required for such underbrushing . 
b.  In the event that a property owner applies for a permit for non- single-family development or commences any construction on land within twelve (12) months of underbrushing , the property owner shall be presumed to have undertaken the underbrushing in anticipation of non- single-family development or construction and the permit for the non- single-family development or construction shall not be issued for a period of one year after completion of the underbrushing . The presumption that the underbrushing activity was completed in anticipation of non- single-family development may be rebutted by the production by the property owner of evidence establishing that the underbrushing was not in anticipation of non- single-family development . 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
E.   Limitations on Development Applications Subsequent to Exempt Forestry Activity
Clearing of a site to circumvent the requirements of this section is prohibited. If the forestry exemption in Sec. 16-6-104.B.2.a.vii above is used to remove all or substantially all of the trees that would have been protected by this section pursuant to a development application , no such application shall be accepted for a period of one year after completion of the timber harvest, or for a period of five years after completion of the timber harvest if the tree removal constituted a willful violation of this section. 
F.   Specimen Tree Preservation
1.   Specimen Tree Defined
For purposes of this section, a specimen tree is any tree of a species designated by the State or federal government as an endangered, threatened, or rare species, or any tree of a type and with a DBH equal or greater than that indicated in Table 16-6-104.F.1, Specimen Trees, for the tree type. 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 )

Sassafras 	12 
 
2.   General Requirements
a.  No specimen tree may be removed except in accordance with paragraph b below. In addition, all specimen trees shall have the following protections, whether located on public or private land with the exception of specimen trees located on single-family lots : 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
i.  Any activities performed within the drip line of a specimen tree shall have the prior approval of the Official . 
ii.  Specimen trees shall not be cut, removed, pushed over, killed, or otherwise harmed. 
iii.  No more than 20 percent of the total area within the drip line of any specimen tree shall be subject to paving or soil compaction, and no paving or soil compaction is allowed within 15 feet of the tree trunk. (See Figure 16-6-104.F.2: Limits of Paving or Compaction near Specimen Trees.) The Official may allow paving or soil compaction beyond the 20 percent limit if low impact development techniques (e.g., pervious pavers, materials placed at or above grade , no use of mechanical machinery) are used as an alternative means of protecting the specimen tree . 
 
Figure 16-6-104.F.2: Limits of Paving or Compaction near Specimen Trees 
b.  If preservation of a specimen tree causes unnecessary hardship, the applicant may apply for a variance from this subsection (see Sec. 16-2-103.S, Variance) once any required State or federal government agency approval, if applicable, to remove the tree is received in writing. 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
G.   Minimum Tree Coverage Standard
1.   Applicability
a.  All new development except for the construction of any public street , pathway, drainage project, single family subdivision, athletic field, airport runway, golf course or minor utility and the redevelopment or alteration of existing development (see subparagraph b below) shall include at least 900 adjusted caliper inches (ACI) of trees per acre of pervious surface area. Pervious surface area equals the gross acreage less the maximum impervious cover required for the proposed development . In the case of development in the CR zoning district , the maximum impervious coverage solely for the purposes of this section shall be 80%. 
b.  Redevelopment or alteration of existing development shall have the option of meeting the standard in subparagraph a above or meeting replacement requirements in Sec. 16-6-104.I, Standards for Supplemental and Replacement Trees, based on trees removed by tree category. 
c.  For the construction of any public street , pathway, drainage project, single family subdivision, athletic field, airport runway, golf course or minor utility the applicant shall make all reasonable efforts to save significant trees and stands of trees. In these cases, at the discretion of the official, a centerline field inspection may relieve the applicant of the tree survey requirement. Reasonable tree replanting may be required by the Official for these uses. 
Example: A 2-acresitein a PR, Parks and Recreation District, is permitted a maximum impervious surface coverage of 45 percent or 0.9 acres. This leaves 1.1 acres of pervious surface. Multiplied by 900 adjusted caliper inches (ACI), it gives asitestandard of 990 adjusted caliper inches which must be met post-development. 
 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
2.   Measurement of ACI
To measure the ACI of trees on the development site , the following Tree Value Factors in Table 16-6-104.G.2, Tree Value Factors, shall be multiplied by the respective DBH in inches of trees in each category as listed in the Tree Equivalency Table in Sec. 16-6-104.H and then totaled. 
TABLE 16-6-104.G.2: TREE VALUE FACTORS
TREE CATEGORY	TREE VALUE
FACTOR 
Category I 	Broad-leaved Evergreen Overstory Hardwoods and Endangered Species 	1.00 
Category II 	Deciduous Overstory Hardwoods and Broad-leaved Evergreen Understory 	0.75 
Category III 	Cone-Bearing Evergreens and Palms 	0.5 
Category IV 	Ornamentals 	0.25 
 
Example: Site has 200 inches of Category Itrees; 550 inches of Category II; 1,020 inches of Category III; 100 inches of Category IV for a total pre-development treevalue ACI of 1,147.5 for thissite. 
 
3.   Supplemental Planting
Supplemental planting shall be at 15 percent of the difference between the minimum standard ACI less the pre- development ACI on the site . 
Example: Thesitehas 1,147.5 ACI pre-development(which is greater than thesiterequirement of 990 ACI, so no supplemental planting is required). If, however, thesitehad 800 ACI pre-development, it would be 190 inches below thesiterequirement. Multiplying 190 x .15 = 28.5 inches oftreesto be planted to raise thesiteto the minimum standard. 
 
4.   Replacement Planting
Replacement planting shall be at 30 percent of the difference between minimum standard ACI and the ACI of trees remaining after construction . At the discretion of the Official, no more than 60% of the required tree planting on golf courses may be substituted for other environmental improvements, such as establishing native plants in lagoons to improve water quality and wildlife habitat or reestablishing understory vegetation in forested areas of the course. 
Example: If thesitehas 500 ACI afterdevelopment: 990-500 = 490 x .30 = 147 inches must be replaced. 
 
H.   Tree Equivalency Table
The purpose of Table 16-6-104.H Tree Equivalency Table, is to illustrate the relative value of broad groups of trees , as well as individual trees , provide guidance in choosing trees , and provide guidance in selecting trees to supplement inadequate buffers.

The signs shall be clearly visible from all sides of the outside of the fenced-in area. The size of each sign must be a minimum of two feet by two feet. The sign message shall identify the fenced or marked area as a tree protection zone and direct construction workers not to encroach into the area (e.g., "Tree Protection Zone: Do Not Enter"). (See Figure 16-6-104.J.2: Tree Protective Fencing and Signage.) 
c.   Duration of Protective Fencing or Signage
Required protective fencing and signage shall be erected before any grading or other development activity begins and shall be maintained until issuance of a Certificate of Compliance following completion of all development in the immediate area of the fencing or signage. 
4.   Tree Protection Zone Encroachments and Protective Measures
Encroachments into tree protection zones may occur only when no other alternative exists, and shall comply with landscaping best management practices and the following limitations and requirements: 
a.   Construction Activity, Equipment, or Materials Storage
No development or demolition activity—including grading, the operation or parking of heavy equipment or the storage of material—shall be allowed within the tree protection zone . 
b.   Soil Compaction
Where compaction might occur due to construction traffic or materials delivery through a tree protection zone , the area must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within a tree protection zone . 
c.   Fill, Retaining Walls, and Drywells
No fill shall be placed within a tree protection zone unless retaining walls and drywells are used to protect trees to be preserved from severe grade changes and venting adequate to allow air and water to reach tree roots is provided through any fill. 
d.   Chemical Contamination
Trees located within a tree protection zone shall be protected from chemical contamination from liquids or other materials, including but not limited to paint, chemical solvents, gasoline, oil, diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, concrete spoils, or rinse water from vehicle cleaning, including rinsing of concrete truck tanks and chutes. 
e.   Impervious Surface
No impervious surface is allowed within a tree protection zone . 
f.   Trenching Prior to Clearing
The removal of trees adjacent to tree protection zones can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees . Prior to clearing activities, trenches with a minimum width of one-and-one-half inches and a minimum depth of 12 inches shall be cut along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear tree roots. 
5.   Inspections
a.  All tree protection measures shall be inspected by the Official before start of any land disturbing activities and during the development process. The Official may continue to conduct random inspections to ensure that retained trees , supplemental trees , and replacement trees are maintained in a healthy state. 
b.  If any tree protected by this section is removed, dies, or is destroyed at any time during development activities or after completion of the development , it shall be replaced in accordance with Sec. 16-6-104.I, Standards for Supplemental and Replacement Trees. 
K.   Tree Damage During Development
1.  If a specimen tree or other existing tree to be preserved under the tree protection plan is damaged during development of the development site , an arborist or other qualified professional shall, at the expense of the applicant , assess the damage and provide a written report to the Official that documents the following: 
a.  Severity of the tree damage; 
b.  Determination on whether corrective measures can be taken to save the tree or whether the tree has been damaged beyond repair ; and 
c.  Any corrective measures recommended to ensure the tree's survival (e.g., pruning damage to tree canopy, root pruning, fertilization, soil enhancements for damage to tree roots, and application of irrigation to compensate for root loss). 
2.  If the assessment concludes that the tree can survive with corrective measures, the applicant shall promptly have recommended corrective actions undertaken by an arborist or other qualified professional. Such corrective measures shall be completed before issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for the development . 
3.  If the assessment concludes that a tree has been damaged beyond repair , the tree shall be replaced with one or more trees that shall comply with the standards in Sec. 16-6-104.I, Standards for Supplemental and Replacement Trees. 
L.   Tree Mitigation Fee
1.   General
The tree mitigation fee is established to allow the future planting of replacement trees removed for development in limited cases where this section's requirements for preservation of specimen trees (see Sec. 16-6-104.F) or for retention of existing tree coverage (see Sec. 16-6-104.G) cannot be reasonably achieved, and to allow the future planting of trees following a disaster. 
2.   Airport
On Hilton Head Island Airport property, the Official may allow a tree mitigation fee payment to be paid in lieu of the replacement of trees removed from beneath the side and approach slopes to the airport runway on determining that adequate buffers are being established in addition to those required in Sec. 16-5-103, Buffer Standards, and Sec. 16-6-102.D, Wetland Buffer Standards. 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
3.   Amount of Fee
The tree mitigation fee shall be calculated by the Official based on the cost of the required replacement trees and the cost of planting. Such costs shall be determined based on a cost estimate received from a local landscaping firm or through pricing information available through a project completed no more than one year earlier. 
4.   Timing of Fee Payment
All required tree mitigation fees shall be paid prior to Development Plan approval. 
5.   Tree Replacement Fund
a.  The Town shall establish and maintain a separate accounting fund for the deposit of tree mitigation fees paid in lieu of providing required replacement trees . Such funds need not be segregated from other Town monies for banking purposes. Any yield on such accounting fund shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for the fund. 
b.  The Town shall maintain and keep financial records for such accounting fund showing the revenues to such fund and the disbursements from such fund, in accordance with normal Town accounting practices. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the Town . 
c.  Monies from the tree replacement fund shall only be spent on planting of trees on publicly owned and maintained property. Qualifying debits include the cost of the trees , cost of installation of the trees , and cost of one year of maintenance for the trees .

( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
ii.  The location of any trees with a DBH less than 6 inches (Category I, II and IV) less than 8 inches (cedar and palmetto trees ) and less than 12 inches (Category III other than cedar and palmetto trees ) that the applicant wishes to count toward the minimum standard of tree coverage on the site ; and 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
iii.  The species and DBH of all trees . 
b.  In conjunction with the tree survey , trees shall be marked with color ribbons, using blue ribbons to mark trees to be preserved, red ribbons for trees to be removed, and orange ribbons for hazardous trees that are proposed to be removed (hazardous trees will not count towards the overall required tree replacement). In heavily wooded areas, the Official may allow large groups of trees to be preserved or removed to be marked with the appropriately colored ribbon extending around the perimeter of the group of trees . 
D.   Pre-Construction Underbrushing
No underbrushing of property other than public utility easements shall occur before a building permit is issued unless approved by the Official as in compliance with this section. 
1.  Applicants for final development approval shall schedule an on-site inspection with the Official to explain the extent and purpose of the underbrushing activity. Purposes that will be considered justification for pre-development underbrushing activity include showing property for sale and facilitating surveying work in very densely vegetated areas. 
2.  In all cases, applicants shall be required to maintain all vegetation in required buffers except for a six-foot-wide path providing access to the interior of the property. Such buffer areas shall be clearly marked and protected prior to the commencement of the underbrushing activity. 
3.  The intent of this provision is to retain suitable species of native understory that can be incorporated into landscape plans and development plan approvals so as to conserve water, preserve indigenous plant species and dependent wildlife species, protect wildlife habitat, and save the applicant landscaping and irrigation costs. 
4.  Following the receipt of final development approval, the applicant shall work with the Official to preserve understory in the front and side buffers. 
5.  Any property owner who fails to abide by this restriction shall be required to restore the affected property to a condition as close to its original condition as practicable. 
6.  Exemption 
a.  Underbrushing on land by a property owner in zoning districts RM4, RM8; RM12, RS3, RS5, RS6, MF, MV, S, and WMU is exempt from the requirements of Section 16-6-104.D; however, all vegetation in required buffers shall be maintained except for a six-foot-wide path providing access to the interior of the property. Such buffer areas shall be clearly marked and protected prior to the commencement of the underbrushing activity. A Natural Resources Permit shall be required for such underbrushing . 
b.  In the event that a property owner applies for a permit for non- single-family development or commences any construction on land within twelve (12) months of underbrushing , the property owner shall be presumed to have undertaken the underbrushing in anticipation of non- single-family development or construction and the permit for the non- single-family development or construction shall not be issued for a period of one year after completion of the underbrushing . The presumption that the underbrushing activity was completed in anticipation of non- single-family development may be rebutted by the production by the property owner of evidence establishing that the underbrushing was not in anticipation of non- single-family development . 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
E.   Limitations on Development Applications Subsequent to Exempt Forestry Activity
Clearing of a site to circumvent the requirements of this section is prohibited. If the forestry exemption in Sec. 16-6-104.B.2.a.vii above is used to remove all or substantially all of the trees that would have been protected by this section pursuant to a development application , no such application shall be accepted for a period of one year after completion of the timber harvest, or for a period of five years after completion of the timber harvest if the tree removal constituted a willful violation of this section. 
F.   Specimen Tree Preservation
1.   Specimen Tree Defined

2.   General Requirements
a.  No specimen tree may be removed except in accordance with paragraph b below. In addition, all specimen trees shall have the following protections, whether located on public or private land with the exception of specimen trees located on single-family lots : 
( Revised 5-17-2016 - Ordinance 2016-07 ) 
i.  Any activities performed within the drip line of a specimen tree shall have the prior approval of the Official . 
ii.  Specimen trees shall not be cut, removed, pushed over, killed, or otherwise harmed. 
iii.  No more than 20 percent of the total area within the drip line of any specimen tree shall be subject to paving or soil compaction, and no paving or soil compaction is allowed within 15 feet of the tree trunk. (See Figure 16-6-104.F.2: Limits of Paving or Compaction near Specimen Trees.) The Official may allow paving or soil compaction beyond the 20 percent limit if low impact development techniques (e.g., pervious pavers, materials placed at or above grade , no use of mechanical machinery) are used as an alternative means of protecting the specimen tree . 
 
Figure 16-6-104.F.2: Limits of Paving or Compaction near Specimen Trees 
b.  If preservation of a specimen tree causes unnecessary hardship, the applicant may apply for a variance from this subsection (see Sec. 16-2-103.S, Variance) once any required State or federal government agency approval, if applicable, to remove the tree is received in writing. 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
G.   Minimum Tree Coverage Standard
1.   Applicability
a.  All new development except for the construction of any public street , pathway, drainage project, single family subdivision, athletic field, airport runway, golf course or minor utility and the redevelopment or alteration of existing development (see subparagraph b below) shall include at least 900 adjusted caliper inches (ACI) of trees per acre of pervious surface area. Pervious surface area equals the gross acreage less the maximum impervious cover required for the proposed development . In the case of development in the CR zoning district , the maximum impervious coverage solely for the purposes of this section shall be 80%. 
b.  Redevelopment or alteration of existing development shall have the option of meeting the standard in subparagraph a above or meeting replacement requirements in Sec. 16-6-104.I, Standards for Supplemental and Replacement Trees, based on trees removed by tree category. 
c.  For the construction of any public street , pathway, drainage project, single family subdivision, athletic field, airport runway, golf course or minor utility the applicant shall make all reasonable efforts to save significant trees and stands of trees. In these cases, at the discretion of the official, a centerline field inspection may relieve the applicant of the tree survey requirement. Reasonable tree replanting may be required by the Official for these uses. 
Example: A 2-acresitein a PR, Parks and Recreation District, is permitted a maximum impervious surface coverage of 45 percent or 0.9 acres. This leaves 1.1 acres of pervious surface. Multiplied by 900 adjusted caliper inches (ACI), it gives asitestandard of 990 adjusted caliper inches which must be met post-development. 
 
(Revised 4-18-2017 - Ordinance 2017-05 ) 
2.   Measurement of ACI
To measure the ACI of trees on the development site , the following Tree Value Factors in Table 16-6-104.G.2, Tree Value Factors, shall be multiplied by the respective DBH in inches of trees in each category as listed in the Tree Equivalency Table in Sec. 16-6-104.H and then totaled. 
TABLE 16-6-104.G.2: TREE VALUE FACTORS
TREE CATEGORY	TREE VALUE
FACTOR 
Category I 	Broad-leaved Evergreen Overstory Hardwoods and Endangered Species 	1.00 
Category II 	Deciduous Overstory Hardwoods and Broad-leaved Evergreen Understory 	0.75 
Category III 	Cone-Bearing Evergreens and Palms 	0.5 
Category IV 	Ornamentals 	0.25 
 
Example: Site has 200 inches of Category Itrees; 550 inches of Category II; 1,020 inches of Category III; 100 inches of Category IV for a total pre-development treevalue ACI of 1,147.5 for thissite. 
 
3.   Supplemental Planting
Supplemental planting shall be at 15 percent of the difference between the minimum standard ACI less the pre- development ACI on the site . 
Example: Thesitehas 1,147.5 ACI pre-development(which is greater than thesiterequirement of 990 ACI, so no supplemental planting is required). If, however, thesitehad 800 ACI pre-development, it would be 190 inches below thesiterequirement. Multiplying 190 x .15 = 28.5 inches oftreesto be planted to raise thesiteto the minimum standard. 
 
4.   Replacement Planting
Replacement planting shall be at 30 percent of the difference between minimum standard ACI and the ACI of trees remaining after construction . At the discretion of the Official, no more than 60% of the required tree planting on golf courses may be substituted for other environmental improvements, such as establishing native plants in lagoons to improve water quality and wildlife habitat or reestablishing understory vegetation in forested areas of the course. 
Example: If thesitehas 500 ACI afterdevelopment: 990-500 = 490 x .30 = 147 inches must be replaced. 
 
H.   Tree Equivalency Table
The purpose of Table 16-6-104.H Tree Equivalency Table, is to illustrate the relative value of broad groups of trees , as well as individual trees , provide guidance in choosing trees , and provide guidance in selecting trees to supplement inadequate buffers.

Chapter 16-7: - Nonconformities 
 
Sec.16-7-101. - General Provisions 
A.   Purpose
The zoning regulations and development standards established by this Ordinance are designed to guide the future development and redevelopment of land within the Town by encouraging and regulating site development and appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses that promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. While the Town recognizes the continued existence of nonconformities is generally inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance , it also recognizes this Ordinance needs to provide flexibility to encourage redevelopment of nonconforming development if it lessens the degree of the nonconformity and if redevelopment is consistent with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan and the district in which the development is located. This Chapter provides for the regulation of nonconforming uses , structures , signs , and site features, and specifies those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities are allowed to continue and redevelop. 
B.   Applicability
This Chapter applies to uses , structures , signs , and site features that were made nonconforming by initial adoption of this Ordinance or a subsequent amendment to this Ordinance . It also applies to uses , structures , signs , and site features that were a lawful nonconformity under a provision of a previously applicable ordinance of the Town and that remain nonconforming with one or more provisions of this Ordinance , even if the type or extent of nonconformity is different. 
C.   Authority to Continue
Legal nonconformities are allowed to continue in accordance with the regulations of this Chapter. 
D.   Burden of Proof
The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity as defined by this Title shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the Town or any other person. 
E.   Repairs and Maintenance
1.  Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep legal nonconforming uses , structures , or site features in a safe condition are permitted, provided that no alterations may be made except those allowed by this Chapter, or as may be required by other law or ordinance . 
2.  This Chapter shall not be construed to prevent strengthening or repair of a structure in compliance with the order of a public official whose duties include protecting the public safety. 
F.   Substitution of Nonconformities for Redevelopment
To provide flexibility and encourage redevelopment of sites with nonconforming features or structures , the Official is authorized to approve a Development Plan for such sites if the proposed development : 
1.  Will not include any new development that increases the amount of encroachment into any required buffer or setback; 
2.  Will not increase the impervious cover on the site over the maximum allowed for the district or the existing impervious cover , whichever is greater; 
3.  Will not result in a density in excess of what is allowed under this Ordinance , or the existing density , whichever is greater; 
4.  Will lessen the extent of existing nonconforming site features to the greatest extent possible; 
5.  Will not have an adverse impact on the public health, safety or welfare; and 
6.  Will lessen the extent of nonconformities related to any existing nonconforming structure on the site to the greatest extent possible. 
G.   Discontinuance or Abandonment
1.  A legal nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of 18 consecutive months shall not be re-established. Any structure or land , or structure and land in combination which was formerly devoted to a legal nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of 18 consecutive months, shall not again be devoted to any use other than a use that is allowed in the zoning district in which the land is located. A conforming use shall not be permitted to revert back to a nonconforming use . 
2.  A legal nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued immediately if it is replaced by a conforming use on the land and thereafter the nonconforming use shall not be re-established. 
3.  A legal nonconforming structure shall be considered abandoned immediately if it is replaced by a conforming structure . Thereafter the nonconforming structure shall not be re-established. 
4.  Discontinuance of a legal nonconforming use or abandonment of a legal nonconforming structure shall be deemed to exist upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following, for a period of 18 consecutive months: 
a.  Failure to obtain permits or take all other necessary steps to resume a legal nonconforming use ; or 
b.  Utility services, such as water and electricity, to the property are disconnected; or 
c.  Removal of equipment or fixtures which are necessary for the operation of a legal nonconforming use ; or 
d.  Structures that have fallen into disrepair as defined by Section 9-8-10 of the Municipal Code ; or 
e.  Signs advertising a legal nonconforming use are removed. 
H.   Expansion, Enlargement, or Extension
For purposes of this Chapter only, the terms "expansion", "enlargement" or "extension" refer to any increase in the size of a legal nonconforming structure , or site feature. The footprint of any existing nonconforming site feature or structure may be maintained or expanded as long as the applicant receives an approval as provided in Sec. 16-7-101.F, Substitution of Nonconformities for Redevelopment, unless one of the following is involved: 
1.  Expansion , enlargement, or extension associated with a nonconforming use ; and 
2.  Replacement of a nonconforming site feature with a nonconforming structure ; and

B.   Relocation
A legal nonconforming use may not be moved, in whole or in part, to any other portion of the parcel of land on which it is located, or to another parcel of land , unless the use will be in conformance with the use regulations of the district into which it is moved. 
C.   Change in Use
A nonconforming use , if changed to a conforming use , may not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use . 
D.   Accessory Use
A use that is accessory to a legal nonconforming use shall not continue after the legal nonconforming use has ceased or been abandoned or discontinued, unless it conforms to all provisions of this Ordinance .  
Sec.16-7-103. - Nonconforming Structures 
The following provisions apply to all nonconforming structures unless approved in accordance with Sec. 16-7-101.F, Substitution of Nonconformities for Redevelopment. 
A.   Expansion, Relocation or Redevelopment
A legal nonconforming structure shall not be expanded, enlarged, relocated, or redeveloped, in whole or in part, unless the structure is made conforming in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or is otherwise allowed by the provisions in this Chapter or Chapter 16-9: Disaster Recovery. 
B.   Damage or Destruction of Nonconforming Structure
A legal nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed by means not covered by Chapter 16-9: Disaster Recovery (including intentional human destruction), may be repaired, reconstructed, or rebuilt only in accordance with the following requirements. 
1.   Single-Family Exception
a.  A single-family dwelling unit existing within the Town that is damaged or destroyed, and is either permitted in the district in which it is located, or is a legally established nonconforming use in that district, may be rebuilt, restored or repaired consistent with the requirements of Title 15 of the Municipal Code . 
b.  If any such dwelling unit is a legally established nonconforming structure as to a development standard under this Ordinance , then the rebuilding, restoration or repair shall comply with the development standards of this Ordinance to the extent deemed reasonably practical by the Official .

C.   Horizontal Property Regime
1.  The provisions in this chapter shall not be construed or enforced to deprive an owner of a dwelling unit within a horizontal property regime from rebuilding in the event the members of the regime vote for and fully fund, through insurance or otherwise, the total restoration of the development of which the dwelling unit is a part. 
2.  The Town shall require a surety in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance to insure full performance of the restoration project when regime insurance is not sufficient to fully cover the costs of reconstruction. 
D.   Placards and Safety Assessment
1.  Following a disaster, the Town will perform a safety assessment to determine the safety of structures that sustained damage or were destroyed as a result of the disaster. When the safety assessment is complete, each structure will receive a placard informing the owner about the safety of the structure . The following placards will be issued following a safety assessment: 
a.  Green Placard means Inspected—Lawful Occupancy Permitted. 
b.  Yellow Placard means Restricted Use. 
c.  Red Placard means Unsafe—Do Not Enter or Occupy. 
E.   Planning Review Not Required
1.   Planning Review Not Required
a.  Any structure that sustains damage as a direct result of a disaster and receives a green placard after a safety assessment may be repaired to the state or condition that existed prior to the disaster without the necessity of obtaining a development approval or permit. The repair work shall be completed within 18 months of the date the Mayor declares the Town is ready to begin receiving applications for permits after the declared disaster. 
b.  If a structure receives a green placard after a safety assessment and the repair is delayed through litigation or other cause beyond the control of the owner, the time of such delay due to litigation or other cause beyond the control of the owner shall not be considered when computing the 18-month period for the repair work. 
c.  Owners who want to repair or rebuild damaged structures who cannot or do not comply with the time period requirements for repair work set forth in subparagraphs a and b above, shall comply with all relevant procedures and standards of this Ordinance in repairing or rebuilding a structure .

Sec.16-10-103. - Use Classifications, Use Types, and Definitions 
A.   Residential Uses
1.   Description
The Residential Uses classification is primarily characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Such household living uses include single-family dwellings and multifamily dwellings (triplexes and other multifamily development , including townhouse development ). The Residential Uses classification also includes group living uses (the residential occupancy of a group of living units by persons who do not constitute a single-family ), as well as recreational vehicle (RV) parks (providing spaces for overnight accommodation of people in a recreational vehicle ). Accessory uses commonly associated with Residential Uses are recreational activities, raising of pets, hobbies, parking of the occupants' vehicles, and administrative offices in multifamily , group living , and recreational vehicle (RV) parks developments. Home occupations are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations (see Sec. 16-4-103.E.3, Home Occupation). 
2.   Use Types and Definitions
Group Living 
The residential occupancy of a group of living units by persons who do not constitute a single-family and may receive some level of personal care. Individual living units often consist of a single room or group of rooms without cooking and eating facilities, but unlike a hotel , are generally occupied on a monthly or longer basis. Uses include group homes, assisted living facilities, and similar uses . Although continuing care retirement communities may include single-family and multifamily dwellings and health care uses , they are categorized as a group living use because of their focus on the present or future provision of personal care to senior citizens and their integration of various uses as a single cohesive development . Group living does not include uses where persons generally occupy living units for periods of less than 30 days (e.g., hotels ), which are categorized as Resort Accommodation Uses . It also does not include uses where residents or inpatients are routinely provided more than minor health care services (e.g., nursing homes , hospitals ) unless they are associated with a continuing care retirement community. These types of facilities are categorized as Health Services uses . Accessory uses common to group living uses include recreational facilities, administrative offices, and food preparation and dining facilities. 
Multifamily 
A building , parcel , or development containing three or more dwelling units . This use includes townhouse developments and manufactured housing parks. 
Mixed-Use 
Development that includes two or more different uses , which shall include multifamily use and one or more of the Office uses, as described in Sec. 16-10-103.F or one or more of the Commercial Services uses , as described in Sec. 16-10-103.G or some combination thereof. Such uses should be functionally integrated and share vehicular use areas, ingress/egress, and pedestrian access . 
Recreational Vehicle (RV) Park
