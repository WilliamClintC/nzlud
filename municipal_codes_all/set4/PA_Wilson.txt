§ 38-4 WILSON CODE § 38-7
1:20
§ 38-7. Vested benefit.
Should a police officer, before completing superannuation retirement age
and service requirements but after having completed 12 years of total
service, for any reason cease to be employed as a full-time police officer
by the Borough, and who is a member of the pension fund, he shall be
entitled to vest his retirement benefits by filing with Council within 90
days of the date he ceases to be a full-time police officer a written notice
of his intention to vest. Upon reaching the date which would have been
his superannuation retirement date if he had continued to be employed
as a full time officer, he shall be paid a partial superannuation retirement
allowance determined by applying the percentage his years of service bears
to the years of service which he would have rendered had he continued to
work until his superannuation retirement date to the gross pension; using,
however, the average monthly compensation during the appropriate period
prior to his termination of employment.
§ 38-8. Postponed retirement.
A member may continue employment after attaining normal retirement
date, if requested to do so by Borough Council, and the member voluntarily
agrees to do so. Such members as are retired shall be subject to service,
from time to time, as a police reserve, in cases of riot, tumult or
preservation of the public peace until unfit for such service, when they may
be finally discharged by reason of age or disability. The retirement benefit
shall be based on the average monthly compensation during the last 36
months of employment by the Borough.
§ 38-9. Refund; disability benefits; death benefits.
A. Should an officer or member of the police force be discharged or
voluntarily withdraw from the police force, or for any reason
whatsoever be ineligible to receive a pension after having contributed
to the fund, he shall be entitled to a refund of all money paid by him into
the fund together with 4% of all interest earned by such monies while in
the fund, as determined by Borough Council, less any amounts which
have been paid to him from the fund by pension or otherwise, and he
shall be excluded from further participation in the fund and shall have
no further rights therein. If such ineligibility is due to nonservice
disability or nonservice death prior to retirement, such monies shall be
paid to the police officer or, in case of death, to a designated beneficiary
or to his estate.
B. In the event of permanent injury or disease contracted in the actual
performance of his duties, and without fault, neglect or misconduct on
his part, which prevents the police officer from performing his duty as a
police officer, benefits shall become payable to the police officer at a
rate equal to 50% of the officer's average monthly compensation,
provided that any police officer who receives benefits for the same
injury under the Social Security Act (49 Statutes 620, 42 U.S.C.A. § 301
§ 38-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 38-9
1:21
et seq.) shall have the disability benefits offset or reduced by the
amount of such benefits.
(1) "Total and permanent disability" means a physical or mental
condition of a member resulting from bodily injury or disease or
mental disorder which renders him incapable of engaging in any
gainful employment.
(2) A police officer who has indicated his desire to retire on disability
pay and is found eligible for disability payments as set forth above
shall receive a monthly pension for the remainder of his life, or
until sooner reinstated as an active member of the police force,
provided, however, that if the police officer retiring on disability
shall be eligible for and receive workmen's compensation benefits
or other insurance benefits from Borough-owned policies for such
disease or injury, and if such workmen's compensation and other
insurance benefits shall exceed the amounts set forth herein for
disability payments, then no disability shall be made to the retiring
member until such workmen's compensation or other insurance
benefits shall have been exhausted. In the event such workmen's
compensation benefits or other insurance benefits from Boroughowned
policies for such disease and injury are payable but do not
exceed the monthly service related disability pension payment,
then each disability pension payment hereunder shall be reduced
by the amount of such workmen's compensation or other insurance
benefits.
(3) The determination as to the existence and the continuance of the
disability shall be made by one or more qualified physicians
appointed by the Borough Council. A disabled member may be
required to submit to a physical examination to prove the existence
of disabilities and every six months may be required to submit to a
physical examination to prove its continuance.
C. Survivor benefits shall accrue to widows and certain minor children of
members who are entitled to benefits by reason of age and service or
disability as follows:
(1) The surviving spouse of a member of the police force or a member
who retires on pension who dies or, if no spouse survives or if he or
she survives and subsequently dies, then the child or children
under the age of 18 years, or if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23 years, of a member of the police force or a
member who retires on pension who dies, shall, during her lifetime
in the case of a surviving spouse or until reaching the age of 18
years or, if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years
in the case of a child or children, be entitled to receive a pension
calculated at no less than 50% of the pension the member was
receiving or would have been receiving had he been retired at the
time of his death.
§ 38-9 WILSON CODE § 38-9
1:22
§ 38-10. Contributions.
(2) The surviving spouse of a member of the police force who dies
before his pension has vested or, if no spouse survives or if he or
she survives and subsequently dies, the child or children under the
age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or attaining the age
of 23 years, of the member of the police force shall be entitled to
receive repayment of all money which the member invested in the
pension fund plus interest or other increases in value of the
member's investment in the pension fund unless the member has
designated another beneficiary for this purpose.
(3) For the purposes of this article, the phrase "attending college" shall
mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited
institution of higher learning and are carrying a minimum course
load of seven credit hours per semester.10
D. When beneficiaries entitled to receive benefit. [Added 7-13-2009 by
Ord. No. 749, approved 7-13-2009]
(1) The beneficiaries (as defined in this Subsection D) of a police
officer shall be entitled to receive a benefit if a police officer dies:
(a) After he/she has begun receiving benefits under a normal
retirement benefit; or
(b) After he/she has begun disability retirement benefits, provided
that such benefits did not terminate to his/her death benefits
because he/she ceases to be disabled; or
(c) While still employed by the Police Department and having met
the age and service requirements for normal benefits; or
(d) Prior to commencement of any retirement benefit under this
section and was vested in his/her accrued benefit.11
A. The Borough Council agrees to contribute the payments made by the
State Treasurer to the municipality from the monies received from
taxes paid upon premiums by foreign casualty insurance companies for
purposes of pension, retirement, death or disability benefits for
policemen which shall be used as follows to reduce the unfunded
liability or, after such liability has been funded, to apply against the
annual obligation of the municipality for future service costs or, to the
extent that the payment may be in excess of such obligation, to reduce
the member's contributions. It shall be the duty of the Borough Council
to apply such payments as set forth above.

meeting of each year shall act on whether or not a cost-of-living increase
shall be granted for members of the police force receiving retirement
benefits; provided, however, that if such cost of living is granted, it shall not
exceed the percentage increase in the consumer price index from the month
in which the police member last worked; provided, further, that in no case
shall the police pension benefits exceed 75% of the average monthly salary
for computing return of benefits; and provided, further, that the total cost
of living increase shall not exceed 30%. No cost of living increase shall be
granted which would impair the actuarial soundness of the police pension
fund.
§ 38-12. Management of funds.
All the funds of this plan shall be held by a trustee or trustees appointed
by the Borough Council, in trust, under a trust agreement which shall be a

corpus or income of the Trust shall be used for or diverted to purposes other
than the exclusive benefit of the members and contingent annuitants of this
plan prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to
such persons. No person shall have any interest in or right to any part of
the earnings of the trust or any part of the assets thereof; except as and to

documents on behalf of the Board, in which event the Board shall notify
the Trustees in writing of such action and the name or names of its
member or members so designated. The Trustees thereafter shall
accept and rely upon any document executed by such member or
members as representing action by the Board until the Board shall file
with the Trustees a written revocation of such designation. The Board
may adopt such bylaws and regulations as it deems desirable for the
conduct of its affairs, and may appoint such accountants, actuaries,
counsel, specialists, consultants and other persons as it may deem

and liability arising from any action or failure to act, except when the
same is judicially determined to be due to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such member. In addition, the Board and any member or

accountant, actuary, counsel or consultant appointed by the Board or the
Borough Council.

years of municipal service and multiplying the result by the number of

plan has become incompetent, bankrupt or insolvent or that any attempt
has been made to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge,
encumber or charge any of his benefits under the plan, except as specifically
provided in the plan, then such benefit shall cease and terminate and, in the
event, Council or its agency shall hold or apply the same to or for the benefit

The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 110-2. Applicability. [Amended 7-14-2014 by Ord. No. 773,
approved 7-14-2014]
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business, or corporation
to undertake or cause to be undertaken any construction or development
anywhere within the Borough of Wilson unless an approved building permit
has been obtained from the floodplain administrator of Wilson Borough
pursuant to this chapter and other requirements of the Borough of Wilson. If
there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this chapter, the more
restrictive shall apply.
§ 110-3. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any provisions currently in effect in flood-prone
areas. However, any other or underlying ordinance shall remain in full force
and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive.
§ 110-4. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community;
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage; and
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive developments in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
[Added 7-14-2014 by Ord. No. 773, approved 7-14-2014]
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
chapter does not imply that areas outside any identified flood-prone
area, or that land uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Wilson or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
§ 110-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-4

approved 7-8-1991; 7-14-2014 by Ord. No. 773, approved 7-14-2014]
The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Borough of Wilson, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated July 16, 2014,
and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or
the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as
part of the Flood Insurance Study. The above-referenced FIS and
FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are hereby
adopted by the Borough of Wilson and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
B. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
C. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
D. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable

§ 110-19. Disputes. [Amended 7-14-2014 by Ord. No. 773, approved
7-14-2014]
Should a dispute arise concerning the identification of any flood-prone area,
an initial determination shall be made by the floodplain administrator, and
any person aggrieved by such decision may appeal to the Wilson Borough
Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
A. The areas considered to be flood-prone may be revised or modified by
the Council of Wilson Borough where studies or information provided
by a qualified agency or person documents the need or possibility for
such revision.
B. The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the
Borough Council where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revisions. However,
prior to any change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, a
community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard
area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 110-20B for

notification of the violations no attempt has been made to remove the
graffiti from the premises, the Borough may undertake any necessary
cleanup. The Borough of Wilson will offer to remove said graffiti from
the premises at no cost to the property owner. If the property owner
does not allow the removal of the graffiti the Borough may require said
owner to pay for costs and expenses. Any cost or expense incurred by
the Borough for removal of graffiti and cleanup of private property may
be billed to the owner within 14 days of removal. Upon failure to repay

§ 132-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and entitled as the "Borough of Wilson Rules
and Regulations for Borough Parks and Recreation Areas."
§ 132-2. Statutory authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted to Boroughs
pursuant to the Borough Code, 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 101, et seq., as amended,
and pursuant to such other police powers and other powers which may be
lawfully exercised by Boroughs.
§ 132-3. Interpretation and legislative findings.
This chapter is declared to be an exercise of the police power of the
Borough of Wilson and its provisions shall be liberally construed for the
preservation and protection of the natural environment, public peace,
health, safety and welfare. The Borough of Wilson finds as follows and
declares that this chapter is passed in response to the following facts:
A. Unlawful and inappropriate behavior in the parks and recreation areas
of the Borough diminishes these precious assets and deprives citizens
of the full use and enjoyment of the natural beauty, recreational
opportunities and peaceful repose that parks and recreation areas are
intended to preserve.
B. In addition to more serious criminal acts that threaten personal injury
and property damage, a wide range of illegal disorderly behavior can
transform a park or recreation area into an unwelcoming, unattractive
and ultimately unsafe public space requiring increased expenditures for
public safety and maintenance.
C. The laws intended to preserve and protect the parks and recreation
areas for the benefit of all are effective only if those who use the parks
and recreation areas obey the law. The current criminal and civil
penalties for violating the law are frequently inadequate alone to deter
illegal behavior, prevent its recurrence or provide for the removal of the
offender from the park or recreation areas.

C. Disclosure. The owner or manager shall disclose to the occupant, in
writing, on or before the commencement of the tenancy: the name,

D. Maintenance of premises.

International Property Maintenance Code/2006, as amended, and
shall regularly perform all routine maintenance, including lawn
mowing and ice and snow removal, and shall promptly make any
and all repairs necessary to fulfill this obligation.
(2) However, the owner and occupant may agree that the occupant is
to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations or
remodeling, if such responsibilities are established in writing. Such
an agreement may be entered into between the owner and
occupant only if entered into in good faith and not for the purpose
of evading the obligations of the owner or occupant.
(3) The existence of an agreement between owner and occupant shall
not relieve an owner of any responsibility under this article or other
Borough codes for proper repair and maintenance of a building or
premises.
E. Rental agreement and addendum.
(1) All rental agreements for regulated rental units shall be in writing
or otherwise legally enforceable.

alternative version is preapproved by a Code Enforcement Officer.
The owner shall secure a written acknowledgment from the
occupants that the occupants have received the addendum. Upon
oral or written request by the Borough of Wilson, the owner, within
10 days of the request, shall furnish to the Borough copies of the
acknowledgment that the occupants received the addendum.
F. The owner and occupants shall comply with all provisions of the
Pennsylvania Landlord-Tenant Act.50
G. Common areas. The owner shall be responsible to minimize disruptive

and to maintain proper physical conditions in such areas. The owner
shall be required to ensure that common areas and the outside
premises are in compliance with Borough codes.
H. Eviction. In the event that an occupant(s) of a regulated rental unit is
involved in a third disruptive conduct violation within any three year
period during which a residential rental license was required, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall provide a written statement to the owner or
his manager that the property shall be vacated. If the disruptive
conduct was caused by only one occupant, then the owner or his
manager officer shall limit the vacate order to that person. Occupants
shall be responsible to prevent their guests from engaging in disruptive
conduct on the premises. The owner shall begin eviction proceedings
within 15 days after receiving such statement and shall continue such
proceedings to completion, without interruption, unless the occupants
vacate the premises. Once an eviction is ordered, those occupant(s)
shall not be permitted to occupy any area on the same lot for a
minimum period of two years. In addition, once an eviction is ordered,
those occupant(s) shall not, for a minimum period of two years, be
permitted to occupy any dwelling unit or boarding/rooming house unit
that is owned by the same person or entity within the Borough of
Wilson.
(1) Failure of an owner to comply to vacate the premises shall result in
the suspension or revocation of the residential rental license and
shall be a violation of this article.
(2) This article shall not limit the ability of an owner to evict tenants in
compliance with state law for reasons other than violations of this
article.
(3) A requirement to evict occupants shall not apply if a successful
appeal is made to the Property Maintenance Board of Appeals, or if
the District Magistrate rules in the occupant's favor during eviction
proceedings, or where a court appeal or other legal action has been
filed that would lawfully prevent eviction.

Code Enforcement Officer, the owner shall take necessary action, or
cause such action to be taken, to eliminate the violation within the time
limit provided on the notice or citation.

(1) In case the owner of premises shall neglect, fail or refuse to comply
with any notice from the Borough or its Code Enforcement Officer
to correct a violation relating to maintenance and repair of the
premises under any Code within the period of time stated in such
notice, the Borough may cause the violation to be corrected. There
shall be imposed upon the owner a charge of the actual costs
involved, plus 25% of said costs or $50, whichever is greater, for
each time the Borough shall cause a violation to be corrected. The
owner of the premises shall be billed after such work has been
completed. Any such bill which remains unpaid and outstanding
after the time specified therein for payment shall be grounds for
the imposition of interest and a municipal lien upon the premises as
provided by law. Such a lien may be reduced to judgment and
enforced and collected as provided by law, together with interest at
the legal rate, attorney's fees and court costs.
(2) The remedies provided by this subsection are not exclusive and the
Borough and its Code Enforcement Officer may invoke such other
remedies available under this article or other applicable Codes,
ordinances or statutes, including, where appropriate,
condemnation proceedings or declaration of premises as unfit for
habitation; or suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of the
residential rental license.
K. The owner or manager shall allow and schedule inspections by a Code
Enforcement Officer of the premises during Borough business hours
after a minimum of seven calendar days notice have been provided to
the owner or manager. The owner or manager shall provide a minimum
of three calendar days' advance notice to at least one adult occupant of
each rental unit of the time and date of the inspection. These advance
notice requirements shall not apply when the Code Enforcement Officer
has reason to believe that an imminent threat to public health and
safety may exist. See also § 142-8.

designated year, the Borough may inspect the unit in one or more
following years.

Code violation on the property. These time extensions shall only
apply after the first initial inspection and if the property has not
been subject of any Code enforcement actions (other than items
that were satisfactorily corrected within 30 days), and has no
outstanding taxes, fines or fees due to the Borough of Wilson or a
Borough Authority. If a regulated rental unit was inspected by the
Borough for Code compliance within the previous three years, then
an inspection under this article may be delayed to result in a

immediately vacated, a Code Enforcement Officer may require
that the violations be corrected within 24 hours, or another
time period stated on the notice or citation.
(2) Nonrenewal. A Code Enforcement Officer shall delay or deny the
renewal of a residential rental license if there are outstanding
violations of Borough codes for that rental unit that have not been
corrected at the time of license renewal. If the violations are not a
threat to the safety of the occupants or other members of the
public, a Code Enforcement Officer shall permit the current
occupants to continue to reside in the premises for a reasonable
period of time established by a Code Enforcement Officer in the
notice of nonrenewal, with the time limit removed when the
violations of Borough codes are corrected. A Code Enforcement

Enforcement Officer. Such suspension shall continue until such
time as a violation(s) of Borough codes is corrected.
(a) If the violations are not a threat to the safety of the occupants
or other members of the public, a Code Enforcement Officer
shall permit the current occupants to continue to reside in the
premises for a reasonable period of time established by a Code
Enforcement Officer in the notice of suspension.
(b) A Code Enforcement Officer may suspend the license to rent a
regulated rental unit if the owner or his/her designated
manager are not available or do not respond to contacts by a
Code Enforcement Officer, or if the name and contact
information for the owner or manager is no longer valid, or if
the manager no longer represents the owner.
(5) Reinstatement. A residential rental license shall be reinstated if the
owner of a regulated rental unit corrects the reason for the
revocation of the residential rental license and has paid the
residential rental license reinstatement fee.
C. Criteria for applying sanctions. The Code Enforcement Officer, when
deciding upon the sanctions provided in Subsection B above, shall
consider the following:
(1) The effect of the violation on the health and safety of occupants of
the regulated rental unit, other residents of the premises, and
neighboring residents.

those violations were satisfactorily corrected in a timely manner.
(3) The effect of sanctions upon the occupants, particularly when the

the owner and good faith efforts of the owner to bring the property
into compliance.

by occupants of regulated rental units as required by this article.

owner or manager of the action to be taken and the reason therefor.
Such notification shall be in writing, addressed to the owner or
manager in question, and shall contain the following information:

I. Building sewer construction.
(1) Building sewers shall be constructed in such a manner that results
in the building sewer meeting all local and state requirements.
(2) Installation of the building sewer shall be in accordance with the
following standards and all other practices to ensure a quality
installation:
(a) Bedding. All pipe used for building sewers is to be laid on
proper bedding. This bedding shall consist of crushed stone
laid to a minimum depth of six inches under clay pipe. No stone
bedding is required under cast-iron pipe unless subsurface
conditions such as rock are encountered. In these cases,
proper bedding is required. No slag will be allowed as bedding
or fill in building sewers.
§ 147-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-12
1:235
§ 147-13. Right of access.
The Easton Area Joint Sewer Authority shall have the right of access at
all times to any part of any improved property served by the treatment
works as shall be required for the purposes of inspection, measurement,
sampling and testing and for performance of other functions relating to
service rendered by the Easton Area Joint Sewer Authority through the
treatment works.
§ 147-14. Additional rules and regulations.
The Authority shall have the right to adopt, from time to time, such
additional rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary and proper in
connection with the use and operation of the treatment works, which rules
and regulations shall become effective as though set forth herein.
(b) Joints. All pipe joints used in building sewers must be in
accordance with ASTM standards utilizing resilient materials.
Every joint must be watertight so as to not allow groundwater
infiltration.
(c) Connection to public sewer mains.
[1] Connection of building sewers to the public sewer mains
will be made by utilizing existing Y-fittings or laterals
which were installed and plugged during construction,
where they exist.
[2] Connection of building sewers to public sewer mains
where no Y or lateral exists will be done by means of
cutting the main line and installing a Y-fitting whenever
feasible.
[3] Where it is not feasible to install a Y-fitting in the existing
main line, it may be necessary to tap into the main line.
These tapped connections are frequent sources of future
trouble and consequently must be made with the utmost
care. Supervision of tapping procedures may be required
by the Plumbing Inspector.
(d) Location of potable water line relating to building sewers.
Potable water lines are to be laid in a separate trench from the
building sewer whenever feasible. If the potable water line
must be laid in the same trench as the building sewer, the
water line must be laid as far as possible above the elevation of
nearby sewers.
(e) Clean, select backfill only must be used and is to be properly
placed over pipes in such a manner as not to cause damage or
potential damage to them. Backfill will be tamped to minimize
settling. The surface will be returned to its original or
satisfactory condition.

above. The Borough Council may, for subdivisions exceeding 10
acres in size where large lots are proposed, waive the ten-acre
maximum requirements set forth above, provided that such a
subdivision shall not be the first stage of a larger development or
tract.
(2) In such a case, the subdivider shall submit the final plan application
which shall be processed by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the requirements of §§ 153-15 through 153-18.
Said final plan application, if it does not require any alteration or
modification, may be reviewed and approved in accordance with
the procedures set forth in § 153-17. However, in the event that a
modification or condition for approval is required, then the plan
shall be considered to be a preliminary plan and a new final plan
application incorporating the required conditions or modifications
shall be submitted.
(3) Any subdivider desirous of following this procedure may also
submit a sketch plan as set forth in § 153-15 in order to expedite
the preparation of the final plan.

street, the Borough may require marginal access streets, rear service
alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with the major street and separation of local and through
traffic. Where residential reverse frontage lots are utilized, they shall

two feet to 10 feet above the center-line grade of each street. Such
clear sight triangles shall be established from the point of intersection
of the center lines of the intersecting streets for a distance of 75 feet
where both streets are local streets, 100 feet where one or both streets
are collector streets or nonresidential streets and 150 feet where one or
both streets are major streets.
D. To the fullest extent possible, intersections with major streets shall be
located not less than 800 feet apart, measured from center line to
center line.

public health, safety or welfare. All aggrieved persons, firms or corporations

that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good-faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice, and thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final

A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with a primary place of employment within the
Borough of Wilson during the tax year. Each natural person who

basis, in accordance with the provisions of this article.

(1) Emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services;
(2) Road construction and/or maintenance;

year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for
that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:

successor to be a total, one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough
utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall
have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2
forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to
the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Borough that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax
from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for a given
calendar year becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year
under Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of the calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
§ 157-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 157-14
1:313
§ 157-15. Duty of employers to collect.
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person under this subsection,
plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject
to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue
collection under this article.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
(NOTE: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425; with respect
to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426.) Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to
remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is
later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for
refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
A. Each employer within the Borough of Wilson, as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Wilson but who engage in
business within the Borough of Wilson, is hereby charged with the duty
of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the Borough of Wilson and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the Borough of
Wilson.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this

1:314
§ 157-16. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 157-17. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 157-14 above and remits the amount so withheld in accordance
therewith.
G. Employees shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

§ 157-18. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the Borough of Wilson shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 157-19. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 157-20. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough of Wilson but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
Borough of Wilson do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents
of the Borough of Wilson. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the Borough of Wilson and employee of a nonresidential employer
may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed person,
and in the event his tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of
this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 157-21. Duty of Collector; administration and enforcement of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires that the
person work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in
the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council.
It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by

in his custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject
to this tax who are in his employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600
and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to

have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton
County as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is authorized to examine the books and payroll records of
any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an
employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each
employer is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the
means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

§ 157-24. Interpretation; validity.
A. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to empower the Borough
of Wilson to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation
not within the taxing power of the Borough under the Constitution of
the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of

subdivision imposes a tax on real estate transactions taxed under this
article, the provisions of said Section 8 shall apply.88

of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

(6) A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife but who have since been divorced,

provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent
and child or the spouse of such child; between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister; and brother or sister or the spouse of
a brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation
under this subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,

commercial purposes.

proper development of a site plan, as required herein, and to
prevent unnecessary expenses associated with the development of
a site plan. This optional procedure shall be considered to be a
convenience for the applicant and shall not constitute an official
zoning permit application or submission and shall not convey any
benefits or assurances to the applicant which he would not
otherwise have had if such an optional site plan were not submitted
by the applicant. All such optional plans shall be clearly marked
with the words "Sketch Plan."

competent review authority.
F. The appropriate body (Zoning Officer or Zoning Hearing Board as
required by this chapter) shall take action by approving or disapproving
the plan either within 45 days after receiving the Planning
Commission's written recommendation or within 90 days after the site
plan is officially submitted. The Zoning Officer shall inform the
applicant, in writing, of the action taken by the appropriate body and

§ 170-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-11
1:369
(7) Sanitary and stormwater facilities and connections. Provisions to
be made for treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial
wastes, water supply and storm drainage. Submission of a
stormwater management plan with supporting calculations shall be
required.
(8) The capacity and arrangement of all buildings used or intended to
be used for dwelling purposes, including information on total land
area, area to be reserved in common open space, density, maximum
building coverage, total area to be covered with impervious
surfaces and other information which will assist the Commission in
determining compliance with this chapter.
(9) A description of any proposed use in sufficient detail to permit the
Commission to determine compliance with the performance and
traffic impact requirements set forth in § 170-85 and the floodprone
area requirements of § 170-86.
(10) Any other data deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer, Planning
Commission, or Borough Council to enable them to determine the
compliance of the proposed development with the terms of this
chapter.
I. Site design guidelines. In addition to the requirements of § 170-11H,
the following guidelines are presented to assist the applicant in the
preparation of site and building plans and to assist the Planning
Commission in the review of all site plans. These guidelines are divided
into nine categories and are meant to encourage creativity, innovation
and well-designed developments. They not only apply to principal
buildings and structures, but also to all accessory buildings, structures,
freestanding signs and other site features.
(1) Preservation of landscape. Preserve the landscape in its natural
state by minimizing tree and soil removal. Ensure that grade
changes are compatible with the general appearance of
neighboring developed areas.
(2) Relation of proposed buildings to environment. Relate proposed
structure(s) harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings
that have a visual relationship to the proposed structure(s). To
achieve this favorable relationship between existing and proposed
uses, create focal points with respect to avenues of approach,
terrain features or other buildings and relate open space between
all existing and proposed buildings.
(3) Drive, parking and circulation. For vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking, give
special attention to the location and number of access points to
public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general
interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic
and arrangement of safe and convenient parking areas. Design
these vehicular and pedestrian areas to enhance the appearance of
§ 170-11 WILSON CODE § 170-11
1:370
§ 170-12. Zoning and occupancy permits and certificates.
an access to the proposed buildings and structures and to the
neighboring properties.
(4) Surface water drainage. Give special attention to proper site
surface drainage to ensure that removal of surface waters will not
adversely affect either neighboring properties or the public storm
drainage system. Remove and efficiently carry away all stormwater
from all roofs, canopies and paved areas. Collect surface water in
all paved areas to permit vehicular and pedestrian movement.
(5) Utility service. Place electric and telephone lines underground
where possible. Locate, paint and undertake any other treatment to
ensure that any utilities which remain above ground will have a
minimal adverse impact on neighboring properties.
(6) Advertising features. Ensure that the size, location, lighting and
materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures
or features will enhance rather than detract from the design of
proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties.
(7) Special features. Provide needed setbacks, buffer yards and other
screening methods for exposed storage areas, exposed machinery
installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings
and structures and similar accessory areas and structures to help
make them compatible with the existing or contemplated site
design and with neighboring properties.
(8) Performance, traffic impact and flood area requirements.
Adequately address all requirements identified relative to
§§ 170-85 and 170-86.
(9) Subdivision and land development ordinance requirements. Where
the zoning proposal requires approval under Chapter 153,
Subdivision and Land Development, of the Code of the Borough of
Wilson, the site plan shall also address the requirements of that
chapter.
A. Applications to Zoning Officer.
(1) All applications for zoning permits for permitted or special
exception uses, for occupancy permits, for certificates of
nonconforming use, for variances and for interpretations of any
fact or provision of this chapter shall be made directly to the
Zoning Officer. Such applications shall be in writing and shall
include a plot plan drawn to scale showing the location and
dimensions of the lot area and of the proposed uses of buildings
and/or land and any other information required by this chapter.
§ 170-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-12
1:371
(2) All applications for special exception or other uses subject to site
plan review as set forth in § 170-11H shall also include the

shall be in writing and shall explain fully the facts and particulars of the
case and shall clearly state the reasons and provisions of this chapter
on which the appeal is based.
C. Zoning permits.
(1) The purpose of the zoning permit is to determine compliance with
the provisions of this chapter, and no person shall erect, alter or
convert any structure, building or part thereof, nor alter the use of
any land, subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, until a zoning
permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer, zoning permits shall
be issued in duplicate and one copy shall be kept conspicuously on
the premises, and no person shall perform building operations of
any kind unless a zoning permit is being displayed as required by
this chapter.
(2) Permits granted for uses of a temporary or seasonal nature may be
limited to the appropriate length of time (refer to § 170-93). The
Zoning Officer or the Zoning Hearing Board may revoke a zoning
permit at any time if it appears that the application is in any respect
false or misleading or that work being done upon the premises
differs materially from that called for in the application.
(3) No zoning permit shall be issued by the Zoning Officer for any
special exception or variance or appeal except on written order of
the Zoning Hearing Board, or for any proposed construction,
alteration or use that would be in violation of any provision of this
chapter.
(4) No zoning permit shall be issued by the Zoning Officer for any
conditional use except on written order of the Borough Council.
(5) Unless there has been substantial progress in the work for which a
zoning permit was issued, as determined by the Zoning Officer, said
permit shall expire one year from the date of issue, except that the
Zoning Officer may grant a request for a reasonable extension of
time, not to exceed one year, if warranted by the nature of the
construction involved.

1:372
§ 170-13. Zoning Officer.
D. Occupancy permits. The purpose of an occupancy permit is to certify
that the premises comply with the provisions of this chapter and may be
used for the purposes set forth in the occupancy permit. Prior to the use
or occupancy of any land or building or for any change of use of any
existing building or for any change of use of land, an occupancy permit
shall be secured from the Zoning Officer. A copy of the occupancy
permit shall be kept upon the premises and shall be displayed upon
request made by any officer of the municipality. All applications for
occupancy permits shall be in writing on forms to be furnished by the
Zoning Officer.
E. Certificate of nonconforming use. The registration of an existing
nonconforming use and/or structure may be requested by the owner of
the property where such a use or structure is located. Upon application
by such an owner, the Zoning Officer shall inspect and register the
nonconforming uses and/or nonconforming structures on the property.
The owner of the premises occupied by the lawful nonconforming use or
structure will then be issued a certificate of nonconforming use from
the Zoning Officer. Such certificate shall be for the purpose of certifying
to the owner his right to continue such nonconforming use or structure
in accordance with the requirements of § 170-92.
A. Appointment of Zoning Officer. This chapter shall be enforced by the
Zoning Officer who shall be appointed by the Council. Said Zoning

(f) The preparation and submission of a report of its activities to
the Council once a year.
(2) All findings and decisions of the Board shall be in writing and shall

the applicant unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an
extension of time.
(3) The Board shall perform such other duties as may be provided or
made necessary by this chapter or by State Act of 1968, P.L. 805,
No. 247, as reenacted and amended, including the interpretation of
zoning boundaries, the holding of hearings after proper notice or

reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in
this chapter as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the
Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.), as may be
amended by state statute in the future, and this chapter.
§ 170-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-15
1:375
A. Purpose. The special exception process is designed to allow careful
review of uses that have some potential of conflicts with adjacent uses
or areas.
B. Special exception procedure.
(1) A site plan shall be submitted, which shall contain the information
required in § 170-11. If a fully engineered subdivision or land
development will be required, it may be submitted separately, such
as after a special exception is approved.
(2) The Zoning Officer should provide a review to the Zoning Hearing
Board regarding the compliance of the application with this
chapter.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board shall follow the procedures provided in
§ 170-14.
(4) The Borough staff should offer a special exception application to
the Planning Commission for any advisory review that the
Commission may wish to provide. However, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall meet the time limits of state law for a decision,
regardless of whether the Planning Commission has provided
comments.
C. Consideration of special exception applications. When special
exceptions are allowed by this chapter, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance
with standards established by this chapter, including the following:
(1) The applicant shall establish by credible evidence that the
application complies with all applicable requirements of this
chapter. The applicant shall provide the Board with sufficient plans,
studies or other data to demonstrate compliance.
(2) The approval may be conditioned upon the applicant later showing
proof of compliance with other specific applicable Borough, state
and federal laws, regulations and permits. Required permits or
other proof of compliance may be required to be presented to the
Borough prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, building
permit, certification of occupancy and/or recording of an approved
plan.
(3) The applicant shall establish that the traffic from the proposed use
will be accommodated in a safe and efficient manner that will
minimize hazards and congestion, after considering any
improvements proposed to be made by the applicant as a condition
on approval.
(4) The application shall include proper site layout, internal
circulation, parking, buffering, and all other elements of proper
design as specified in this chapter.
§ 170-15 WILSON CODE § 170-15
1:376
§ 170-16. Conditional use process.
(5) The proposed use shall not substantially change the character of
any surrounding residential neighborhood, after considering any
proposed conditions upon approval such as limits upon hours of
operation.
(6) The proposed use shall not create a significant hazard to the public
health and safety, such as fire, toxic or explosive hazards.
(7) The proposed use shall be suitable for the site, considering the
disturbance of steep slopes, mature woodland, wetlands,
floodplains, and other important natural features.
D. Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board
may require such reasonable conditions and safeguards (in addition to
those expressed in this chapter) as it determines are necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter. Conditions imposed by the
Zoning Hearing Board shall automatically become conditions of the
building permit issued pursuant thereto, and any failure to comply with
said conditions shall be a violation of this chapter.
A. Purpose. The conditional use approval process is designed to allow the
Borough Council to review and approve certain uses that could have
significant impacts upon the community and the environment.
B. Procedure. The Borough Council shall consider the conditional use
application and render its decision in accordance with the requirements
of the MPC.
(1) A site plan shall be submitted which shall contain the information
required in § 170-11. Detailed site engineering, such as stormwater
calculations and profiles, are not required at the conditional use
stage. If a fully engineered subdivision or land development plan
will be required, it may be submitted separately, such as after a
conditional use is approved, or, an applicant may voluntarily choose
to submit a subdivision or land development plan for review at the
same time as a conditional use application.
(2) The Zoning Officer should provide a review to the Borough Council
regarding the compliance of the application with this chapter.
(3) The Borough staff shall submit a conditional use application to the
Planning Commission for any review that the Commission may wish
to provide. However, the Borough Council shall meet the time limits
of state law for a decision, regardless of whether the Planning
Commission has provided comments.
(4) The only uses that shall be approved as conditional uses shall be
those listed as conditional uses in § 170-82.
§ 170-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-16
1:377
§ 170-17. Variances.
C. Consideration of conditional use application. The Borough Council shall
determine whether the proposed use would meet the applicable
requirements of this chapter. The same standards shall apply to a
conditional use as are listed in § 170-15 for a special exception use.
D. Conditions. In approving a conditional use application, the Borough
Council may attach conditions they consider necessary to protect the
public welfare and meet the standards of this chapter. These conditions
shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to comply with
such conditions shall constitute a violation of this chapter and be
subject to the penalties described in this chapter.
A. Board may authorize variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear
requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this
chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board
may grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare; and
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter. Violations of any condition or safeguards
imposed by the Board are subject to the appeals, violations and
penalties set forth in § 170-21.

(1) Buildable area shall be the total lot area of the tract, not including
the following:
(a) Areas within the future rights-of-way of preexisting or

C. Flexibility in placement. The total number of dwelling units allowed on
the tract may be placed at any appropriate locations within the
buildable area of the tract in compliance with other provisions of this
article. A condominium form of ownership is allowed, provided the
applicant shows compliance with applicable state law.
D. In calculating the allowable overall density, land which is capable of
further development or subdivision for additional dwellings shall not be
counted unless the possibility of such development or subdivision is
precluded by a formal permanent deed restriction or conservation
easement restricting the land to use for only common open space and
preventing future development, which the deed restriction duly
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds, and with such
restriction noted on the official record plan.
E. The total area covered by all impervious surfaces shall not exceed the
existing total area of impervious surfaces found on the tract, or 80% of

nonresidential uses shall not exceed 50% of the total building floor
area.
H. Building separation. Principal buildings within a PRD shall have
minimum separation as defined by the Construction Code.95 Where new
construction is proposed that would result in a principal residential
building abutting a principal nonresidential building, then a 20 feet
minimum separation distance shall apply between the two buildings.
I. Building setbacks. Minimum setback from principal buildings to all
existing or proposed lot lines and/or street rights-of-way shall be 30
feet, except that such setback shall not apply where buildings are
lawfully attached. The required minimum setback shall not apply to
structures existing as of the date of this article. No setbacks shall apply
for accessory buildings.

open space shall not be less than 25% of the total site area. As an
alternative, the developer may also be permitted to contribute a fee in
lieu of providing open space as determined by the Borough Council.
C. Landscaping, buffering, and tree preservation.
(1) A landscaping plan for the tract shall be submitted to the Borough
with the final plan, and shall be subject to approval by the Borough
Council. Except as otherwise approved by the Borough Council, all
landscaping provisions of this chapter (§ 170-87, Buffer yard
requirements, and § 170-90, Landscaping) shall apply.

§ 170-67 WILSON CODE § 170-68
1:432
§ 170-69. Ownership and maintenance of common areas.
The standards for a planned residential development established by
provisions adopted pursuant to this article may require that the common
areas and/or open space resulting from the application of standards for
density, or intensity of land use, shall be set aside for the use and benefit of
the residents in such development and may include provisions which shall
determine the amount and location of said common areas and/or open space
and secure its improvement and maintenance for common area/open space
use, subject, however, to the following:
requirements of § 170-87A, Softening buffers. A softening buffer is
not required where a screen buffer is to be provided.
(3) Where a commercial area adjoins a residential area within the
planned development or in adjacent land around the perimeter of
the development, a screen buffer shall be provided between the
residential and commercial areas in accordance with the
requirements of § 170-87B, Screen buffers.
(4) Except as otherwise approved by the Borough Council, tree
preservation provisions of this chapter and Chapter 153,
Subdivision and Land Development, shall apply. Where extensive
natural tree cover and vegetation does not exist and cannot be
preserved on the PRD site, appropriate landscaping shall be
planted to enhance the appearance of the PRD, aid in erosion
control, provide protection from wind and sun, screen streets and
parking areas and enhance the privacy of dwelling units.
(5) Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The protection
of trees six inches or more in diameter (measured at a height 3.5
feet above the original grade) shall be a factor in determining the
location of open spaces, structures, underground utilities, walks
and paved areas. Areas in which trees are preserved shall remain
at original grade level and undisturbed wherever possible.
A. The developer shall make provisions to ensure that all common areas
shall be properly maintained. The developer shall provide for and
establish a homeowners' association or other similar organization for
the ownership and maintenance of all common areas and commonly
owned facilities. The legal agreements for such common ownership and
maintenance shall be subject to approval by Borough Council, as a
condition of final PRD approval, prior to recording.
B. The Borough may, at any time and from time to time, accept the
dedication of land or any interest therein for public use and
maintenance, but the Borough need not require, as a condition of the
approval of a planned residential development, that land proposed to be
set aside for common open space be dedicated or made available to
public use. The provisions may require that the landowner provide for
and establish an organization for the ownership and maintenance of the
§ 170-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-69
1:433
common open space, and that such organization shall not be dissolved
nor shall it dispose of the common open space, by sale or otherwise
(except to an organization conceived and established to own and
maintain the common open space), without first offering to dedicate the
same to the public.
C. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the planned residential development fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the development plan, the Borough may serve written
notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the planned
residential development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within 30 days thereof, and
shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held
within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing the Borough may modify
the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an
extension of time within which they shall be corrected.
D. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications
thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days or any extension
thereof, the Borough, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned residential development and to prevent
the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter
upon said common open space and maintain the same for a period of
one year. Said maintenance by the Borough shall not constitute a taking
of said common open space, nor vest in the public any rights to use the
same.
E. Before the expiration of said year, the Borough shall, upon its initiative
or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon
notice to such organization, or to the residents of the planned
residential development, to be held by the governing body or its
designated agency, at which hearing such organization or the residents
of the planned residential development shall show cause why such
maintenance by the Borough shall not, at the option of the Borough,
continue for a succeeding year. If the governing body, or its designated
agency, shall determine that such organization is ready and able to
maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, the Borough
shall cease to maintain said common open space at the end of said year.
If the governing body or its designated agency shall determine that
such organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open
space in a reasonable condition, the Borough may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said common open space during the next
succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in
each year thereafter.
§ 170-69 WILSON CODE § 170-69
1:434
§ 170-70. Approval by sections.
In the case of a development plan calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the development plan delineating all proposed sections
as well as deadlines within which applications for final approval of each
section are intended to be filed. Yearly updating of the schedule shall be
completed by the landowner on or before the anniversary of the tentative
plan approval until final approval of the final section has been granted. Any
modifications in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the
Borough Council.
§ 170-71. Time limitations.
F. The decision of the governing body or its designated agency shall be
subject to appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same time
limitation, as is provided for zoning appeals by this chapter.
G. The cost of such maintenance by the Borough shall be assessed ratably
against the properties within the planned residential development that
have a right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become
a lien on said properties. The Borough, at the time of entering upon said
common open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice
of lien in the office of the prothonotary of the county, upon the
properties affected by the lien within the planned residential
development.
A. Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any
of the conditions of the tentative plan approval, including compliance
with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plans, then
the protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final development plan within the said five years
shall apply. For any section or sections, in which the required
improvements have not been substantially completed within the fiveyear
period, the aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term
or terms of three years from the date of final plan approval for each
section.
B. Failure to meet schedule. Failure of the landowner to adhere to the
aforesaid schedule of submission of final plans for the various sections
shall subject any such sections to any and all changes in these
regulations, this chapter, planned residential regulations, and any other
ordinances or plans enacted by the Borough subsequent to the date of
the initial planned residential development plan submission, and no
development or further development shall take place on the property
included in the development plan until after the property is reclassified
by enactment of an amendment to this chapter.

submitted;
[2] Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions
not included in the development plan as submitted; or

communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings
of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the
reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial.
The written communication shall set forth with particularity in
what respects the development plan would or would not be in the
public interest, including but not limited to findings of fact and
conclusions on the following:
(a) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the
property, including but not limited to density, bulk and use, and
the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be
in the public interest;
(b) The respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of
the Borough;

1:438
(e) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed PRD to

residents of the PRD in the integrity of the development plan.
(11) In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval with
or without conditions, the Borough Council may set forth in the
official written communication the time within which an application
for final approval of the development plan shall be filed, or, in the
case of a development plan which provided for development over a
period of years, the periods of time within which applications for
final approval of each part thereof shall be filed. Except upon the
consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant of
tentative approval and application for final approval shall not be
less than three months, and, in the case of developments over a
period of years, the time between applications for final approval of
each part of the plan shall not be less than 12 months.

landowner. Where tentative approval has been granted, it shall be
deemed an amendment to the Zoning Map, effective upon final
approval, and shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
(13) In the event the PRD is granted tentative plan approval subject to
conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a
copy of the official written communication from the Borough, notify
the Borough Council of his refusal to accept all required conditions,
in which case the Borough Council shall be deemed to have denied
tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the
landowner does not, within 30 days, notify the Borough Council of
his refusal to accept all said conditions, tentative approval of the
development plan along with any conditions shall stand as granted.
(14) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plan of
the PRD for recording nor authorize construction or the issuance of
any zoning and/or building permits. A development plan which has
been given tentative approval as submitted, or which has been
given tentative approval with conditions which have been accepted
by the landowner (provided the landowner has not defaulted or
violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval), shall not
be modified or revoked or otherwise impaired by action of the
Borough pending application for final approval, without the
consent of the landowner, provided an application or applications
for final approval is filed, or, in the case of development over a
period of years, provided applications are filed within the periods of
time specified in the official written communication granting
tentative approval.
§ 170-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-73
1:439
(15) In the event a development plan is given tentative approval and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to
abandon the development plan and shall so notify the Borough
Council, in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file
application or applications for final approval within the required
period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval
shall be deemed to be revoked and all the portion of the area
included in the development plan for which final approval has not
been given shall be subject to those ordinances otherwise
applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and
the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of
the Borough Secretary.
B. Application for final approval.
(1) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in
a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative
approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall be made to
the Zoning Officer of the Borough within the time or times specified
by the official written communication granting tentative approval.
The application shall include any drawings, specifications,
covenants, easements, funds or securities in sufficient amount as
determined by the Borough Council to insure performance and
such other requirements as may be specified by ordinances, as well
as any conditions set forth in the official written communication at
the time of tentative approval. A fee shall be required at the time of
submission in accordance with § 170-76. A public hearing on an
application for final approval of the development plan or a part
thereof shall not be required, provided the development plan or
part thereof submitted for final approval is in compliance with the
development plan theretofore given tentative approval and with
any specified conditions attached thereto.
(2) In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by this chapter and the official
written communication of tentative approval, the Borough Council
shall, within 45 days of such filing, grant such development plan
final approval.
(3) In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the Borough
Council may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 45 days
from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the
landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the
reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public
interest. In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(a) Refile the application for final approval without the variations
objected to.
§ 170-73 WILSON CODE § 170-73
1:440
§ 170-74. Approval requirements.
The following shall be submitted for PRD plan approval:
(b) File a written request with the Borough Council that it hold a
public hearing on his application for final approval. All plans
will be referred to the Wilson Borough Planning Commission
and Northampton County Planning Commission for review. If
the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply
for final approval or within 30 additional days if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development
plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the
landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be conducted
in the manner prescribed in this section for public hearings on
applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the
conclusion of the hearing, the Borough Council shall by official
written communication either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval. The granting or
denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in cases
arising under this section, be in the form and contain the
findings required for an application for tentative approval set
forth in this article.
(4) A development plan or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval, shall be so certified without delay by the Borough Council
and shall be filed on record forthwith in the office of the Recorder
of Deeds before any development shall take place in accordance
therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development plan, the
zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the land
included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion, in accordance with the time provisions stated in § 508
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as
amended by Act 170),97 of said PRD or part thereof as finally
approved, no modification of the provisions of said development
plan or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with
the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of the final plat, the
developer shall record the plat and post financial security in
accordance with the provisions of §§ 513(a) and 509 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as amended
by Act 170).98

payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to the appropriate
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this
article to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event
there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the
fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees collected for the violation of planned residential
development provisions shall be paid over to the municipality whose
ordinance has been violated.
B. The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final

forested or wooded open space and promote the conduct of forestry
as a sound and economically viable use of forested land throughout
the Borough, forestry activities, including timber harvesting, shall
be a permitted use by right in all zoning districts. The following
regulations apply to all timber harvesting within the Borough
where the value of the trees, logs, or other timber products
removed exceeds $1,000. These provisions do not apply to the
cutting of trees for the personal use of the landowner or for
precommercial timber stand improvement.

in this section:
FELLING  The act of cutting a standing tree so that it falls to
the ground.
FORESTRY  The management of forests and timberlands
when practiced in accordance with accepted silvicultural
principles, through developing, cultivating, harvesting,
transporting and selling trees for commercial purposes, which
does not involve any land development.
LANDING  A place where logs, pulpwood, or firewood are
assembled for transportation to processing facilities.
LANDOWNER  An individual, partnership, company, firm,
association, or corporation that is in actual control of forest
land, whether such control is based on legal or equitable title,

and any agents thereof acting on their behalf, such as forestry
consultants, who set up and administer timber harvesting.
LITTER  Discarded items not naturally occurring on the site
such as tires, oilcans, equipment parts, and other rubbish.
LOP  To cut tops and slash into smaller pieces to allow

association, or corporation engaged in timber harvesting,
including the agents, subcontractors, and employees thereof.
PRECOMMERCIAL TIMBER STAND IMPROVEMENT  A
forest practice, such as thinning or pruning, which results in
better growth, structure, species composition, or health for the
§ 170-82 WILSON CODE § 170-83

landowner, usually because any trees cut are of poor quality,
too small or otherwise of limited marketability or value.
SKIDDING  Dragging trees on the ground from the stump to
the landing by any means.
SLASH  Woody debris left in the woods after logging,
including logs, chunks, bark, branches, uprooted stumps, and
broken or uprooted trees or shrubs.

past history, and current species composition are sufficiently
uniform to be managed as a unit.

for surface water with an annual or intermittent flow within a
defined bed and bank.

or commercial processing into wood products.
TOP  The upper portion of a felled tree that is not
merchantable because of small size, taper, or defect.
WETLAND  Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated
soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar

1:495
§ 170-85. Traffic impact requirements.
All development projects will be evaluated by the Zoning Officer to
determine the level of traffic impact on the Borough. This will apply to
all new projects or uses proposed or to any expansion of an existing
development, which is proposed after the effective date of this chapter. The
level of traffic impact will be based on the estimated trip ends generated by
the proposed uses in the project. "Trip ends" are defined as the total number
of trips entering and leaving a specific land use or uses located in a project
per day. These trip ends will be based on the estimated trip generation
rates for various types of land uses based on the latest edition of the
publication entitled "Trip Generation, An Information Report," published by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

constitute a fire hazard or which may be edible or otherwise
attractive to rodents or insects shall be stored outdoors only if
enclosed in containers which are adequate to eliminate such
hazards.
(3) Storage and waste disposal facilities of commercial, industrial,
institutional or multifamily uses shall be screened.
A. Determination of major traffic impact. Any development which has an
estimated average daily traffic (or daily trip ends per day) in excess of
1,000 shall be considered to have a major traffic impact.
B. Special exceptions. All major traffic impact projects shall be considered
to be special exceptions, as defined herein, even if they are listed as
permitted uses in § 170-82, and all procedures applicable to special
exceptions shall apply to zoning applications for such projects.
C. If any project is proposed after the date of adoption of this chapter
which does not have a major traffic impact, as defined herein, and a
§ 170-84 WILSON CODE § 170-85
1:496
later or subsequent addition to that project is proposed within 10
years of the initial project, then the cumulative effect of all separate
submissions shall be used, regardless of any changes in ownership
which may take place over the time period under consideration. This
shall apply to major shopping centers, medical centers, hospital
expansion, apartment complexes, planned cluster residential
developments or any other use proposed under this chapter.
D. The developer shall identify all subsequent phases of a project at the
time of submission of the initial phase.

1:498
§ 170-86. Environmentally sensitive areas.
All areas in the Borough may be proposed for development in accordance
with the requirements set forth in this chapter and Zoning Map. Such areas
may also be subject to special environmental or hazardous conditions or
other site problems which require a special consideration and conformance
with special regulations required to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. Areas of the Borough which are subject to the following special
conditions and problems shall conform with the following additional
requirements.
true and accurate study which has given adequate
consideration to available information and includes
reasonable projections and analysis to the factors
considered and that the study represents the best opinion
of the competent authority on the traffic and parking
impact of the proposed development.
[4] That, if it has not been possible to fully analyze all relevant
factors, then those factors not analyzed shall be identified,
together with the reasons for their exclusion from the
study.
(2) The major traffic impact study shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and a recommendation made to the Zoning Hearing
Board in accordance with the special exception procedures and
requirements established herein. The Planning Commission and/or
Zoning Hearing Board may request additional data or information
to clarify the findings set forth in said study. The Board shall not
approve any such special exception if it determines that any traffic
or parking problem to be created by the proposed development
cannot be adequately alleviated by the developer.
H. The applicant or developer, as determined by the Borough, will be
responsible for the guaranty of payment for the proportionate share of
all traffic control devices or for the construction of public facilities
applicable to the proposed development which are required as a result
of the traffic impact generated by the proposed development project.
A. Floodplains.
(1) General provisions.
(a) The floodplain area shall be those areas expected to be subject
to the one-hundred-year flood, as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) which accompanies the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the Borough by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), dated February 20,
1987, or the most recent official federal revision thereof. Such
mapping and study shall be known as the "Federal Floodplain
§ 170-85 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-86
1:499
Map." The referenced FIS is declared to be part of this chapter
and shall be kept at the Wilson Borough offices.
(b) No development shall be undertaken, no structure or land shall
hereafter be used; no structure shall be located, relocated,
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged or structurally altered;
and no area shall be developed, graded, filled or excavated in
any flood hazard district except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this chapter and any other applicable
ordinances and regulations.
(c) Failure to comply with the provisions of this section is a
violation of this chapter, and the Borough may proceed with
court action and/or issue a declaration of violation, under
Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deny flood
insurance on the property in violation. The effects of having a
Section 1316 violation are nonavailability of flood insurance for
any buildings, possible reduction of market value, risk of
damage without compensation, possible mortgage foreclosure,
and denial of disaster assistance for repair of structural
damage.
(d) Warning and disclaimer of liability.
[1] The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of
this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods
of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes,
such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.
This chapter does not imply that areas outside the
identified floodplain or that land uses permitted within a
floodplain area will be free from flooding or flood damages.
[2] This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Wilson
Borough or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(e) No encroachment, land development, improvement or
reconstruction of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such
action have been notified by the Borough, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office. In
addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the
Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development (DCED) shall be notified prior to any alteration or
relocation of any watercourse.

occurring within the floodplain shall be undertaken only in
strict compliance with the provisions of this article and with all
other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations, including
the UCC, as amended, and Chapter 153, Subdivision and Land
Development.
(g) Under no circumstances shall any new construction, uses,
activity and/or land development adversely affect the capacity
of the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage
ditch or any other drainage facility or system.
(h) Any new construction and/or land development, with the
exception of redevelopment projects, that would cause any
increase in the base flood elevation shall be prohibited.
(i) New construction, development or redevelopment in the
floodway area is prohibited.
(2) Identification and establishment of floodplain areas. The floodplain
area may consist of the following specific areas:
(a) The floodway area (FW): the areas identified as "floodway" in
the AE Zone in the Flood insurance Study prepared by FEMA.
The term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the Flood Insurance Study. Such studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a through technical review by the Borough.
(b) The flood-fringe area (FF): the portion of the AE Zone not
included in the floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary
of this area shall be the base flood elevations shown in the
flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
(c) The general floodplain area (FA): the areas identified as A Zone
in the Flood Insurance Study for which no base flood elevations
have been provided or areas subject to flooding defined by one
of the following methods:

sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
the Borough.
§ 170-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-86
1:501
(d) An initial determination shall be made by the Zoning Officer
should a dispute concerning any floodplain boundary arise. Any
party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board under the provisions of this chapter. The
burden of proof is on the appellant.
(e) The delineation of the floodplain area may be revised by the
Borough where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or
undertaken by FEMA, United States Army Corps of Engineers
or other qualified agency, or an individual. However, prior to
any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
(3) Nonconforming uses and structures in the floodplain. A structure

(1) Purpose. The purposes of stormwater runoff control are:
§ 170-86 WILSON CODE § 170-86
1:520
§ 170-87. Buffer yard requirements.
(a) To guide drainage and prevent increase in runoff on and off the
site.
(b) To prevent destruction and loss of soils on and off the site from
increased runoff.
(c) To prevent siltation of water bodies, watercourses and wet
areas on and off the site and subsequent harm to or loss of
aquatic plant and animal life.
(2) Special requirements for stormwater runoff control.
(a) The owner/applicant shall comply with any stormwater
management plan or ordinance which has been adopted by the
Borough or county which is applicable to the proposed
development.102
(b) All developments shall limit stormwater runoff so that no more
runoff is generated than that of the site in its current or natural
condition. Use of one or more of such techniques as retention
ponds, turfed swales, diversion ditches and energy dissipators
shall be considered.
(c) The Borough Engineer or Code Enforcement Officer shall
require the owner/applicant to provide a stormwater runoff
control plan where site conditions warrant the preparation of
such a plan. The plan shall be based on adequate topographic
surveys, soil investigations and runoff projections. To the
maximum extent possible, the following standards shall apply:
(d) The natural drainage patterns on and off site shall be used in
their present state to the degree possible and protected from
disturbance.
(e) Stormwater runoff shall be directed away from impervious
surfaces and toward absorbent ground area.
(f) The plan shall minimize blockage, collapse or washout, street
drainage or other hazards associated with drainage and spring
runoff conditions.
(g) Connection shall be made to existing stormwater runoff
drainage systems, where possible.
I. Other adverse conditions. Where other adverse environmental or
hazardous conditions exist, the Borough Planning Commission and
Zoning Hearing Board shall establish suitable requirements to ensure
the public health, safety or welfare.

A. Softening buffers. A "softening buffer" is a mixed perimeter landscape
planting intended to provide an informal separation between
neighboring developments. It is not intended to be an impenetrable
screen. Softening buffer yards shall comply with the following
standards:
(1) Refer to Table 1 for requirements in each zoning district or land
use.103
(2) Where a softening buffer is required as per Table 1, a minimum
twenty-foot wide softening buffer shall be required along rear and
side lot lines.
(3) The softening buffer area shall be used for no purpose other than
planting of trees, shrubs and lawn to meet planting requirements
and may include a wall or fence that meets the standards outlined
in this section. Any wall or fence shall be constructed in such a
manner that it will not conflict with sight lines or conflict with the
character of the abutting district. All softening buffer areas shall be
kept free of trash, yard waste, and any other debris.
(4) Existing vegetation. In cases where preserved natural features
existing on the site duplicate or essentially duplicate the planting
requirements of this chapter, these requirements may be waived or
amended by the Borough Council.
(5) Within the buffer area, no slopes shall be steeper than one foot in
height for each four feet in width 25%.
(6) A softening buffer is not required where a screen buffer is
provided.
(7) Location. Softening buffers, when required, shall be aligned
adjacent and parallel to property lines or right-of-way boundaries
but may be sited on any position of the property if permitted by the
Borough Council. Plant material used in the softening buffer shall
be located within 20 feet of the property line or right-of-way lines
and may be grouped informally.
(8) Quantity. Four shade trees and eight deciduous, evergreen or
semievergreen shrubs shall be included for each 100 feet of
property perimeter. Up to 50% of required shade trees may be
substituted with flowering trees, evergreen trees or shrubs at the
rate of two flowering trees, two evergreen trees or 10 shrubs for
every shade tree.
(9) A naturalistic planting design with plants arranged in groups or
clusters rather than symmetrically shall be encouraged. All
required plant materials shall be located within the buffer yard.
Refer to § 170-90F for a list of recommended plant material.
103. Editor's Note: Table 1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 170-87 WILSON CODE § 170-87
1:522

(11) All plant material used shall meet minimum size and other
requirements as stated in § 170-90, Landscaping.
(12) Buffer areas may be included as part of required front, side or rear
yards. All buffer areas shall be maintained and kept clean of all
debris and rubbish.
(13) All landscaping required by this chapter shall be perpetually
maintained by the property owner. Any landscaping needed to meet
a chapter requirement that dies, is removed, or is severely
damaged shall be replaced by the current property owner on a oneto-
one basis as soon as is practical considering growing seasons,
within a maximum of 150 days.
(14)No buffer plants or structures in excess of two feet in height shall
be erected in any sight triangle area.
B. Screen buffers. A "screen buffer" is a predominantly evergreen
perimeter landscape planting intended to provide a formal,
impenetrable visual screen. However, it is not intended to be a
monocultural planting. Screen buffers shall comply with the following
requirements:
(1) All truck loading, outside storage areas, mechanical equipment and
trash receptacles shall be screened from view from streets and
abutting residential areas.
(2) Screening shall consist of evergreen trees in double rows,
staggered five feet to 15 feet on center. Evergreen or deciduous
shrubs may be used to supplement the evergreen trees. Required
spacing depends on the type of trees used:
(a) Pine, spruce and fir: 15 feet on center.
(b) Arborvitae: five feet on center.
(c) American holly and juniper: 10 feet on center.
(d) Hemlock: 12 feet on center.
(3) Trees used for screen buffers shall be composed of 100% evergreen
varieties. Shrubs may be a combination of evergreen and deciduous
varieties. The required plant material shall be so arranged as to
provide immediate visual screen of 50% and at least eight feet in
height at the time of planting.
(4) Walls, fences and/or earth berms may be used in combination with
plant material subject to the approval of the Borough Council and
in conformance with § 170-91C, fence, hedge and wall regulations.

yards. All buffer areas shall be maintained and kept clean of all
debris and rubbish.
(7) All planting in the buffer area shall be installed and thereafter
maintained by the property owner.
(8) No buffer plants or structures in excess of two feet in height shall
be erected in any sight triangle area.
C. Walls or fences within buffer yards.
(1) Fences in residential districts shall be constructed of materials
which do not detract from the general neighborhood.
(2) Fences, hedges or walls which are located on property lines shall
not exceed six feet in height. Fences, hedges or walls which are set
back from property lines may be increased in height at a ratio of
one foot additional height for every two feet of additional setback.
In no case shall any fence, wall or hedge exceed 10 feet in height.
(3) Retaining walls which are used as landscaping features shall be
considered fences and shall be subject to the same height
limitations.

ARTICLE XV
General Regulations
§ 170-88. Lot area, lot width and height regulations.
In addition to complying with the provisions of the district in which a
use is permitted, each use shall comply with the following standards and
requirements where applicable. For certain specific uses or exceptional
situations, these basic regulations are supplemented by Article XIII and by
other provisions of this chapter.
A. Lot area and yard requirements. The lot or yard requirements for any
new building or use shall not include any part of a lot that is required by
any other building or use to comply with the requirements of this
chapter. No required lot area or yard shall include any property, the
ownership of which has been transferred subsequent to the effective
date of this chapter, if such property was part of the area required for
compliance with the dimensional requirements applicable to the lot
from which such transfer was made.
B. Minimum lot area. Where a minimum lot area is specified, no principal
building or use shall be erected or established on any lot of lesser size
than as specified within this chapter.
C. Minimum lot width.
(1) Where a minimum lot width is specified in the applicable district
regulations or other regulations of this chapter, no principal
building or use shall be erected or established on any part of a lot
which has a width less than is specified.
(2) The lot width for a single-family semidetached dwelling or end unit
of townhouses shall be measured from the side lot lines to the
center line of the wall in common with an adjoining dwelling.
D. Yard requirements. No portion of a building or structure shall be built
within the minimum depth of front, side, or rear yards as specified
within this chapter.
E. Maximum height of buildings. No building shall exceed the maximum
height of buildings specified in this chapter.
F. Permitted variations from required areas. The minimum lot, yard and
height requirements of Articles V through XII shall prevail in all cases,
except as follows:
(1) Existing nonconforming lots. In any district where a nonconforming
lot exists as a separate entity at the time of passage of this chapter
and where the owner of the nonconforming lot does not own an
adjoining lot, then the following development is permitted:
(a) Lots in the R-1 and R-2 Zoning Districts.
§ 170-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-88
1:525
[1] If the lot is located in the R-1 or R-2 District, a singlefamily
dwelling, including any attached permitted
accessory use, may be constructed on it as a permitted use
subject to the following requirements:
[a] Minimum lot size: 3,500 square feet.
[b] Minimum lot width: 35 feet.
[c] Minimum front yard: 25 feet.
[d] Minimum rear yard: 15 feet.
[e] Minimum side yards:
[i] One side yard: three feet.
[ii] Both side yards combined: 11 feet.
[f] Maximum building height for principal building: 2.5
stories or 35 feet.
[g] Maximum building coverage: 50%.
[2] If the lot has an existing single-family dwelling located on
it, then the dwelling may be enlarged to comply with, but
not exceed, the requirements listed above.
[3] Accessory structures located in the rear yard area which
are not attached to the principal structure may be built up
to eight feet from the rear lot line and up to two feet from
one side lot line, provided that such accessory structures
are not located closer than four feet to the other side lot
line and are not less than 10 feet from any principal
structure.
(b) Lots in nonresidential zoning districts (H-1, TC, C-1, C-2 and
I-1). If the existing nonconforming lot is located in any
remaining nonresidential zoning district (H-1, TC, C-1, C-2,
I-1), then a structure not exceeding two stories in height may
be constructed on it, for a use permitted in the district in which
it is located, provided that the off-street parking and loading
requirements of this chapter shall be complied with and that
the front, side and rear yards, as required by the district in
which the use is located, are not reduced by more than 1/3 of
said requirement and are compatible with the surrounding
area, as determined by the Board. Said use shall be considered
to be a special exception subject to the review and approval of
the Board.
(c) Changes to existing conforming uses. For changes to existing
conforming uses located on nonconforming lots, see § 170-93.
§ 170-88 WILSON CODE § 170-88
1:526
(d) Nonconforming uses. For requirements governing
nonconforming uses and structures, see § 170-92.
(2) Height limitations. District height limitations for church spires,
cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, chimneys,
smokestacks, antennas, farm structures, silos and flag poles may
extend to a maximum height of 150 feet. Required utility and radio
and television station transmitting or receiving towers which are
permitted under the requirements of this chapter may exceed the
district height limitations by 35 feet. Although exempted from
structural height limitations, these structures should not impair
solar access of buildings or solar collector locations.
(3) Front yard exception. When an unimproved lot is situated between
two improved lots, each having a principal building within 25 feet
of the side lot line of the unimproved lot, and where the lot is not
located on a major state or federal highway, then the required front
yard may be reduced to a depth equal to that of the greater front
yard of the two adjoining lots; provided, however, that it may not be
reduced to below 15 feet in Residential Districts R-1 and R-2.
(4) Projections into yards. Projections into required yards may be
permitted as follows, except that no such projection shall be
located closer than three feet to any side lot line or 10 feet to any
rear lot line or 15 feet to any front lot line, except as may be
provided for in § 170-92 for existing nonconforming lots:
(a) Fire escapes, uncovered stairs and landings, canopies, eaves or
other architectural features not required for structural support
may project into the required side, front or rear yard not more
than a total of three feet.
(b) Accessory structures may project into yards as set forth in
§ 170-88F.
(c) Patios may be located in the required yard area, not closer than
the following to any property line, except that patios
constructed on existing nonconforming lots may line up with
and be as wide as the principal structure on the lot:
[1] Side and rear property lines: five feet.
[2] Front property line: 10 feet.
(5) Changes to conforming uses and buildings. Any conforming use or
building may be repaired, maintained, restored or rebuilt up to the
same dimensions existing at the time of the effective date of
adoption of this chapter.
(6) Any enlargement of an existing conforming use or structure on the
same lot must comply in all respects with the regulations of this
chapter.
§ 170-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-88
1:527
§ 170-89. Unique lots and building locations.
G. Supplementary regulations. Supplementary regulations governing
special conditions, uses or requirements are set forth in Article XIII.
A. Two or more buildings on a lot. Two or more principal buildings located
on a parcel in single ownership shall conform to all the requirements of
this chapter which would normally apply to each building if each were
on a separate lot.
B. Through lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership extends
from one street to another parallel or nearly parallel street or alley, the
Borough Council shall decide which street will be considered as the
front street. No principal structure shall be erected on any portion of a
lot which does not have primary access from an improved public street,
except as specified in § 170-89A and C.
C. Lots fronting on an alley. Individual lots existing at the effective date of
this chapter fronting on an alley shall comply with all the requirements
of this chapter and the district in which said lots are located, except
that no principal structure shall derive its primary or only access from
an alley.
D. Side yard of a corner lot. The side yard of a corner lot which abuts a
street shall be equal to the required front yard for that street, except as
may be limited by § 170-89E.
E. Obstruction to vision. No obstruction to vision, as defined herein, shall
be planted, constructed or maintained in the vicinity of any street
intersection or driveway, entrance or on a corner lot which creates
potential vehicular safety hazards.
(1) In all districts, no structure, fence, planting or other obstruction
shall be maintained between a horizontal plane two feet above curb
level and a horizontal plane seven feet above curb level so as to
interfere with traffic visibility across the corner within that part of
the required front or side yard which is within a horizontal clearsight
triangle bounded by the two street lines (rights-of-way) and a
straight line drawn between points on each such line 25 feet from
the intersection of said lines or extension thereof. When one or both
streets which form the intersection are classified as collector or
arterial highways, the clear-sight triangle bounded by the two
street lines and a straight line drawn between points on such line
shall be 50 feet from the intersection of said lines or extension
thereof.
§ 170-88 WILSON CODE § 170-89
1:528
§ 170-90. Landscaping.
(2) At each point where a private accessway intersects a public street
or road, a clear-sight triangle of 10 feet measured from the point of
intersection of the street line and the edge of the accessway shall
be maintained within which vegetation and other visual
obstructions shall be limited to a height of not more than two feet
above the street grade.
A. General requirements.
(1) Where, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer, the literal
application of these standards in certain cases would work undue
hardship or be plainly unreasonable, the Borough Engineer may
recommend to the Borough Council such reasonable exceptions as
would not be contrary to the public interest. The Borough Council
may modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization
of property while securing substantial conformance with the
objectives of the regulations.
(2) The standards included in these regulations are minimum design
requirements. The Borough Council reserves the right, in any case,
to request that the requirements listed herein exceed these
standards if conditions so warrant.
(3) Nonconforming uses. Whenever there is a nonconforming use, the
nonconforming use must comply with the most restrictive
landscape requirements for either the land use or the zoning
district in which it is located or the zoning district which would
normally permit the nonconforming use.
B. Landscape plan requirements. Where landscaping is required by this
chapter, the applicant shall submit a landscaping plan, in addition to a
site plan.
§ 170-89 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-90
1:529
C. Buffer yards. Landscaping within required Buffer Yards shall meet the
requirements outlined in § 170-87 as well as all other applicable
requirements within this section.
D. Parking lot landscaping.
(1) A minimum of one deciduous shade tree shall be required for every
10 off-street parking spaces.
(2) Where a parking lot is to include 30 or more parking spaces, a
maximum of 15 parking spaces shall be permitted in a row with a
landscape island of 15 feet in width. Where required, this island
shall contain not less than 290 square feet of planting area.
(3) The use of salt tolerant species is encouraged.
(4) When parking areas are located within 100 feet of a public street,
the perimeter of the parking area that is adjacent to the public
street shall be softened by a continuous low hedge around the
outside perimeter. Required softening or screening buffer shrubs
may be used to meet this requirement, so long as the hedge is to be
located within the area where the buffer yard is required.
E. Existing vegetation. In cases where preserved natural features existing
on the site duplicate or essentially duplicate the planting requirements
of this chapter, these requirements may be waived or amended by the
Borough Council.
F. Recommended plant list. The following is the recommended list of
trees, shrubs and ground cover for use in Wilson Borough. However, the
Borough Council may permit other planting types if they are hardy to
the area, not subject to blight or disease and are of the same general
character and growth habit as those listed below. The following sizes
listed for shade trees, evergreen trees, ornamental trees, deciduous
shrubs, evergreen shrubs and ground cover are the minimum

background in a manner or method of display characterized by motion
or pictorial imagery, which may or may not include text and depicts
action or a special effect to imitate movement, the presentation of
pictorials or graphics displayed in a progression of frames which mimic
the illusion of motion, including but not limited to moving objects,
moving patterns or bands of light, or expanding and contracting shapes
and/or fade, dissolve, travel or scrolling features. Video billboards
include projected images or messages with these characteristics onto
buildings or other objects.

§ 170-96 WILSON CODE § 170-97
1:556
(4) Brightness (billboard luminance). The illumination and/or intensity
of the display shall be controlled so as to not create glare, hazards
or nuisances. Such signs shall have a maximum nits level of 7,000

exceed 0.3 footcandle of light above the normal ambient light
levels. Such signs shall be equipped with automatic dimming
technology which automatically adjusts the sign's brightness based

(c) This check shall include the measurement of an all white image
displayed by the billboard to evaluate the worst case condition.
(d) If the difference in illuminance between the billboard-on and
the billboard-off conditions is 0.3 footcandle or less, then the
billboard luminance is in compliance.

months. The applicant shall further provide, in a form acceptable to
the Borough, proof that the record owner and the licensee or other
person in control of the signage consents to the removal of the sign
for reasons as set forth in this subsection, which said consent shall
be in such form so as to be recorded of record with the
Northampton County Recorder of Deeds' office.
(14) Audio or pyrotechnics. Audio speakers and/or any form of
pyrotechnics are prohibited.
(15) Message default mechanism. All signs must be equipped with a
properly functioning default mechanism that will stop the sign in

(16) Where applicable, such signs shall be located, constructed and
maintained in accordance with all applicable Pennsylvania
