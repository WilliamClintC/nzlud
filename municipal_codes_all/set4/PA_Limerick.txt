benefit to the Township of Limerick by enabling it to attract and retain in
employment the best of personnel and thus increase the efficiency of its

funds from which wage or salary payments are to be made in accordance
with the provisions of the law and regulations promulgated by the state
agency and the Federal Security Administrator. Such payments which are
delinquent shall bear interest at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per month until such
time as payments are made.

retirement date for any reason other than death or total and permanent
disability shall receive a complete refund of the total amount of his
member contributions with interest, if such refund is greater in value
than the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit.

TOWNSHIP  Limerick Township.
B. Eligibility. Any officer who has reached his/her normal retirement date
based on age and service (the superannuation date as defined by the
pension plan) may elect to become a DROP participant on the first day
of the month coincident with or next following the attainment of the
requirements for receipt of normal retirement age and service (i.e.,
§ 29-11.7 LIMERICK CODE § 29-11.7
24:38
superannuation) pension benefits under the plan, which is a minimum
of 25 years of service and attaining at least the age of 50. In addition, in
order to be eligible to participate in the DROP, an officer must comply
with the following requirements:
(1) Letter of resignation. An officer electing to participate in the DROP
must provide to the employer a binding and irrevocable letter of
resignation from regular employment with the local government
that discloses the member's intent to retire and specifies the
member's retirement date. This letter of resignation must be
submitted to the employer at least 30 days prior to the date on
which the officer's DROP participation period is to commence.
(2) Written DROP election.
(a) An officer electing to participate in the DROP must complete
and execute a DROP election form provided by the employer.
The DROP election must be signed by the officer, notarized,
and submitted to the employer at least 30 days prior to the
date on which the officer's DROP participation period is to
commence, which shall be specified on the DROP election. The
DROP election shall include a notice to the employer by the
officer that the officer shall resign from employment with the
employer effective on his or her resignation date, which shall
be no more than 36 months from the commencement of the
participant's DROP participation period. Once approved by the
employer, an officer's resignation date shall be irrevocable. An
officer shall cease to work as a police officer on the officer's
resignation date, unless the employer terminates or honorably
discharges the officer prior to the resignation date. The DROP
election shall also: [Amended 3-6-2018 by Ord. No. 385]
[1] Detail or reference the DROP participant's rights and
obligations under the DROP (as stated in this document);
[2] Include an agreement and acknowledgement that the
DROP participant agrees to forgo:
[a] Active membership in the retirement system and plan;
[b] Any growth in the salary base used for calculating the
DROP participant's regular retirement benefit and any
additional growth in the DROP participant's monthly
retirement benefit;
[c] Any growth in the DROP participant's DROP
supplemental account, except any credited interest (in
accordance with the terms of the plan) between zero
and 4.5%;
§ 29-11.7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 29-11.7
24:39
[d] Any additional benefit accrual for retirement
purposes, including but not limited to length of service
increments; and
(b) The written DROP election form shall also include an
acknowledgement by the DROP participant that he/she has
reviewed the DROP Plan and Program as well as this
agreement and that he/she is retiring and entering into the
DROP knowingly and voluntarily and that he/she agrees to
enter into a release of claims (provided separately and
attached hereto)20 that will be attached to the Written DROP
election. The form shall also include an acknowledgement by
the DROP that he/she shall be solely responsible for all tax
liability and any other fees or penalties that may be incurred as
a result of his/her participation in the DROP.
(3) Waiver and release. Each officer who seeks to become a DROP
participant must execute a waiver of claims and release (attached
hereto)21 before he or she may become a DROP participant. The
failure to execute this document will preclude the officer from
participating in the DROP Program.
C. Pension contributions. After an officer elects to participate in the DROP
Program by the execution of the DROP notice and his or her DROP
participation period commences, the officer shall not make any
required contributions to the plan during the DROP participation
period.
D. Accrual of non-pension benefits. After an officer elects to participate in
the DROP Program, all other terms and conditions of employment, as
set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the employer
and the association, shall continue to apply during the DROP
participation period with the exception of those provisions relating to
the plan. The parties agree that a DROP participant shall be entitled to
the continued accrual during the DROP participation period of leave
time but shall not be entitled to the payout of any payments for unused
leave time during or at the end of the DROP participation period. At the
end of the DROP participation period, a DROP participant shall not be
entitled to any severance pay or other lump sum payment (except his or
her accrued DROP account).
E. Disability during DROP participation period.
(1) The employer, association, and all DROP participants recognize the
unique nature of the DROP Program and the benefits that it offers
to the DROP participant and the employer. Such benefits for the
employer, however, are based on the DROP participant being able
to work to provide the employer with the benefit of his or her
20.Editor's Note: Said form is available in the Township offices.
21.Editor's Note: Said form is available in the Township offices.
§ 29-11.7 LIMERICK CODE § 29-11.7
24:40
experience, as stated above. It is recognized that if the DROP
participant cannot work by providing police services for the
employer, the employer will suffer a significant burden and the
purpose and intent behind the DROP Program will not be fulfilled
to the detriment of the taxpayers of the employer and the employer.
(2) Accordingly, in light of those acknowledgements and concerns, if a
DROP participant becomes temporarily incapacitated during his or
her DROP participation period, the following shall apply:
(a) The DROP participant shall continue to participate in the
DROP Program as if fully employed. Such participant shall
receive disability benefits (including heart and lung benefits, if
eligible and such benefits are applicable) in the same amount
and under the same terms as disabled police officers that are
not participating in DROP except:
[1] If a DROP participant is still temporarily disabled and has
not returned to work as of his or her required resignation
date, such participant shall be required to resign on his or
her resignation date and after such date shall be a former
DROP participant who shall begin to receive directly the
same monthly pension benefit payment as calculated at
the beginning of the DROP participation period. Such
officer shall not be entitled to any other benefit, disability
payment or monthly disability pension benefit from the
plan or the Township, except that the normal retirement
benefit that was previously deposited into the DROP
account shall be paid directly to the former DROP
participant.
[2] If a participant becomes permanently disabled from
performing his or her full police duties during his or her
DROP participation period (whether due to a work-related
or non-work-related injury), the participant shall be
honorably discharged from employment after the injury
that prevents the DROP participant from performing full
police duties is deemed to be permanent.
[a] If the injury has been deemed to be work-related, the
DROP participant shall terminate employment and
resign from employment and begin to receive the
service-connected disability benefit under the plan to
the extent permitted by law. At such time, if a
disability benefit under the plan is legally payable, the
DROP participant's normal retirement benefit shall
cease in lieu of the disability benefit under the plan.
[b] Alternatively, if the injury is deemed to be non-workrelated,
the DROP participant shall terminate his or
her DROP Participation and resign from employment
§ 29-11.7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 29-11.7
24:41
and begin to receive directly his or her normal
monthly pension benefit, as calculated at the
beginning of the DROP participation period, and
payment of his or her DROP account in accordance
with this agreement.
F. Death during DROP period. If a DROP participant dies during the DROP
participation period, his or her survivor(s) as defined by the plan or, in
lieu thereof, the participant's named beneficiary, shall be entitled to
receive benefits and the participant's DROP account, and shall be
handled according to the following provisions:
(1) If a DROP participant dies during his or her DROP participation
period and a killed-in-service death benefit is determined to be
payable in accordance with Act 51 of 2009 (which amended
Emergency and Law Enforcement Personnel Death Benefits Act by
creating a killed-in-service benefit applicable to municipal law
enforcement officers and repealed the killed-in-service benefit in
Act 600, as amended by Act 30 of 2002) to the DROP participant's
survivors, the participant's DROP election shall be revoked and the
DROP account shall be payable to survivor(s) as defined by the plan
or, in lieu thereof, the named beneficiary, of the deceased DROP
participant. At that time, the DROP participant's monthly
retirement benefit shall cease and there shall be no survivor's
benefit payable under the plan to the DROP participant's survivors.
(2) If death occurs during the DROP participation period but the killedin-
service death benefit under Act 51 of 2009 (as defined above) is
deemed to be not payable, the DROP participant's DROP election
shall be revoked, and the survivor(s) as defined by the plan or, in
lieu thereof, the participant's named beneficiary, shall be entitled to
a lump-sum payment of the DROP account balance and the
participant's survivor(s) as defined by the plan shall receive the
survivor's benefit, if any, in accordance with and as defined by the
plan.
G. Forfeiture of benefits. Notwithstanding an officer's participation in the
DROP Program, an officer or DROP participant who is convicted of or
pleads guilty to engaging in criminal misconduct which constitutes a
"crime related to public office or public employment," as that phrase is
defined in Pennsylvania's Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311 to
1314, shall forfeit his or her right to be a DROP participant and also
shall forfeit his or her right to receive a pension, including any amounts
currently deposited in the DROP account. In such a case, the member
shall only be entitled to receive the contributions, if any, made by the
member to the plan, without interest.
H. The monthly pension benefit calculation and limitation on pension
accrual. After the effective date of the DROP notice, the officer shall no
longer earn or accrue additional years of service for pension calculation
purposes under the plan. No benefit increases that may occur after a
§ 29-11.7 LIMERICK CODE § 29-11.7
24:42
DROP participant's commencement date, including bargained pension
enhancements, mandated pension enhancements through arbitration,
or pension enhancements mandated by law, will apply to the DROP
participant and shall not increase the DROP participant's frozen
pension under the plan, as calculated on the effective date of the
DROP participation period as stated in the DROP notice. Upon the
commencement date, the participant's monthly pension payment shall
be transferred into the participant's DROP account. The average
monthly compensation of the participant for pension calculation
purposes shall remain as it existed on the effective date of the DROP
participation period as stated in the DROP notice. Earnings or increases
in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the
calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the plan. The
pension benefit payable to the members shall increase only as a result
of cost-of-living adjustments, if applicable, that may be applicable and
in effect under the plan on the effective date of the member's
participation in the DROP Program or by applicable cost-of-living
adjustments specifically granted to DROP participants or retirees
thereafter.
I. Maximum participation. The maximum period of participation in the
DROP Program is 36 months. Once the maximum participation has been
achieved, the participant must terminate employment and separate
from service. [Amended 3-6-2018 by Ord. No. 385]
J. DROP participation termination.
(1) DROP participant's participation in a DROP shall end when the
DROP participant is separated from employment from or by the
employer during his or her DROP participation period for any
reason or when the DROP participant reaches his or her
resignation dates as stated in his or her DROP election form. A
DROP participant may change the DROP termination date to an
earlier date within the limitations of this agreement, which in no
event shall exceed 36 months. [Amended 3-6-2018 by Ord. No.
385]
(2) Upon termination of the DROP participation period, the balance of
the DROP account shall be paid to the terminating DROP
participant as stated in § 1114(d) of Act 44 and shall be subject to
any applicable taxes under applicable law and to any attachment
and assignment as stated in § 1114(e) of Act 44.
(3) A DROP participant shall be ineligible to re-enroll in the DROP
Program after his or her participation in the DROP is terminated
for any reason, even if the former DROP participant is re-employed
by the local government with renewed active membership in the
retirement system.
K. DROP pension payments. Upon entry into the DROP Program, a DROP
participant's service and average monthly compensation (as each is
§ 29-11.7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 29-11.7
24:43
defined under the plan) will be frozen and his or her pension payment
will be calculated as if he or she retired and ceased employment with
the employer on the effective date of such officer's DROP participation
period as stated in the DROP notice. The monthly pension payment
shall be credited towards the participant's DROP account as stated
below.
L. Individual DROP account. The employer shall create a DROP account
which shall be a ledger account for each DROP participant. Such
account shall be accounted for separately but will not be physically
segregated from the other Plan assets. While employed and a DROP
participant, the DROP participant's monthly retirement benefit shall be
credited to the DROP account as stated above and the benefit
accumulation under the DROP shall be calculated and credited in
accordance with the policy set by the plan administrator. No interest
shall be credited to any DROP participant's account, except to the
extent that the officer's account earns such interest up to a maximum of
4.5%.
M. Distribution options.
(1) Commensurate with DROP Program participation, a participant
must make an election on forms designated by the employer of the
payout option(s) desired upon termination of the DROP period. This
election may be changed at any time before termination. The
distribution options are as follows:
(a) A lump-sum cash distribution.
(b) Rollover to another eligible retirement plan (as permitted by
law) or to an individual retirement account ("IRA").
(c) Any other method permitted by applicable law.
(2) The DROP participant shall be responsible and liable for all taxes
and other governmental fees, penalties and charges that may be
due as a result of the DROP participant's termination of the DROP
and receipt of the monies in his/her DROP account.
N. Beneficiary designation. Commensurate with DROP Program
participation, a participant must make an election, on forms designated
by the employer, of the beneficiary or beneficiaries he or she intends to
receive the balance of the participant's DROP account in the event of
the participant's death and there are no survivors as defined by the plan
before such balance has been distributed.
O. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP Program shall be consistent
with the provisions covering deferred retirement option plans set forth
in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall be binding
upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP participants who
have balances in their DROP accounts. The DROP Program may only be
amended by a written instrument, signed by an authorized
§ 29-11.7 LIMERICK CODE § 29-11.7
24:44
representative of the employer and the association, not by any oral
agreement or past practice.
P. Interpretation of provisions.
(1) This document shall be interpreted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. An officer's election to participate
in the DROP Program shall in no way be construed as a limitation
on the employer's right to suspend or terminate an officer for just
cause under applicable law or to grant the officer an honorable
discharge based upon a physical or mental inability to perform his
or her duties. Nothing provided hereunder shall be construed as a
change to the parties' practice of calculating pensionable
compensation, and except for the ability to establish a DROP
account and participate in the DROP Program, nothing herein is
intended to create new pension benefits of any kind which did not
exist as of the date the DROP Program is adopted.
(2) Nothing provided hereunder shall guarantee any officer or DROP
participant a specific term of employment. All DROP participants
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions of employment
(except those relating to benefits under the plan and retiree
benefits), rules and regulations, and disciplinary procedures as
other officers and members who are not DROP participants.
Q. Cost to participants.
(1) The original costs for starting the DROP, as well as the costs of
administering the DROP Program as a whole will be paid by the
Township and/or the plan, as decided by the Township.
(2) Any costs incurred by an individual officer's DROP account will be
paid by the officer.
(3) Participants and all parties to this agreement agree that this DROP
Program must at all times be cost neutral. If it is determined at any
time that this DROP Program is not cost neutral, or that the DROP
Program increases the costs to the plan in any amount, the
association and the Township shall meet to discuss how the cost
will be funded. The two options to be discussed are limited to the
following:
(a) To the extent permitted under applicable law, the association
will make up the cost, through increased contributions; or
(b) If the association will not agree to the remedy stated above in
Subsection Q(3)(a), the DROP Program will be terminated and
removed from the plan and any future participation in the
DROP will cease. All then-current DROP participants shall
continue until their DROP participation period ends (i.e., the
resignation date).
§ 29-11.7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 29-11.7
24:45
(4) No issue in this Subsection Q shall be subject to the grievance and
arbitration procedure contained in the collective bargaining
agreement between the Township and the association or as
outlined below in Subsection S.
R. Compliance with law.
(1) The employer and the association acknowledge and agree that the
provisions stated in this agreement are essential to their
agreement and to the continuation of this DROP Program. The
employer and the association further acknowledge and agree that
they believe that all of the provisions in this agreement are in
compliance with applicable law, including Act 44 and Act 51. If any
provision contained in this agreement and DROP Program is found
by a court of law or the Pennsylvania Department of the Auditor
General or any court of law to not be in compliance with applicable
law, including Act 44 or Act 51, the association and the employer
may meet to discuss ways to most efficiently implement any
changes necessary to bring this agreement and DROP Program into
compliance with applicable law and any agreement reached in
those discussions shall be binding on the employer, the association,
and any current and future DROP participants. However, if this
agreement or DROP Program, or any provision contained in this
agreement, is found by any court of law or the Pennsylvania
Department of the Auditor General or any other federal or
commonwealth governmental agency or department to not be in
compliance with applicable law, including Act 44 or Act 51, neither
the association nor the employer is under any obligation to bargain
over bringing the agreement and DROP Program into compliance
with such law and instead may terminate this agreement and the
DROP Program immediately.
(2) The parties acknowledge and agree that any DROP participant will
be bound by any changes to the DROP Program as a result of the
legislation referenced above, regardless of whether at the time
these changes are made such individual is a DROP participant or a
former DROP participant who is then currently receiving his/her
pension directly and has access to his/her DROP account. As a
result, the association, the employer, and all individuals who
become a DROP participant or former DROP participant recognize
that such who become a DROP participant or former DROP
participant do not have a vested or constitutional right in the
benefits provided under this DROP Program to the extent it is
subsequently changed by legislation or found to be unlawful as
stated above as referenced herein. No issue in this Subsection R
shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure
contained in the collective bargaining agreement between the
Township and the association or as outlined below in Subsection S.
S. Arbitration applicable.
§ 29-11.7 LIMERICK CODE § 29-11.7
24:46
(1) The parties agree that, except as stated in Subsections Q and R
with respect to an issue relating to cost neutrality or legality of any
provision of this DROP or the DROP as a whole, an issue arising
under a provision of the DROP Program and/or this agreement shall
be subject to collective bargaining or Act 111 interest arbitration if,
after negotiation, the parties cannot come to an agreement on the
dispute.
(2) The course of action to resolve any association or association
member dispute arising from a provision of the DROP Program and/
or this agreement shall be the same as that contained within the
grievance procedures in the applicable collective bargaining
agreement.

applicable codes or ordinances of Limerick Township shall be subject, for
each violation, to fines and penalties unless otherwise specified in another

hearing is requested before the Code Hearing Board within 15 days
from the receipt of said notice.
E. The Code Enforcement Officer may grant a request for a reasonable

The civil enforcement proceeding shall be initiated by complaint or by
such other means as may be provided by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil
Procedure. An ordinance which is to be enforced through a civil

ordinances of the municipality, are hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
Limerick Township District Justice, Townships may enforce ordinances
in equity. In any case where a penalty for a violation of a Township

proceedings, the violator shall be liable for the penalty imposed,
including additional daily penalties for continuing violations, plus court
costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township in the

Township Board of Supervisors shall provide that its enforcement shall
be by action brought before Limerick Township's District Justice in the
same manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses under
the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Limerick Township
Solicitor may assume charge of the prosecution without the consent of
the District Attorney as required under Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 83(c) (relating
to trial in summary cases). The Board of Supervisors may prescribe
criminal fines not to exceed $1,000 per violation and may prescribe
imprisonment to the extent allowed by law for the punishment of
summary offenses.

appropriate actions or proceedings in law or in equity to effect the
purposes of this chapter.
D. Separate offenses. Separate offenses shall arise for each day or portion
thereof in which a violation is found to exist or for each section of the
ordinance which is found to have been violated.

Transportation Impact Fees paid by an applicant on projects not contained
in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan or may provide credit
against the transportation impact fees for the value of any construction
projects not contained in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan
or may provide credit against transportation impact fees for the value
of any construction projects not contained in the Transportation Capital
Improvement Plan, which are performed at the applicant's expense if all of
the following criteria are met:
§ 82-16. Request for nonbinding estimate.
Prior to making an application for a building permit, an applicant may
request a nonbinding transportation impact fee estimate from the Township,
which shall be based upon the maximum development potential of the site
pursuant to existing zoning regulations, unless the applicant specifies use
of the development.
§ 82-17. Administration; collection; recordkeeping.
A. The applicant has provided written consent to use of its transportation
impact fees or the provision of such credit against the applicant's
transportation impact fees for the specific transportation projects,

75:108
§ 82-18. Time, method, and procedure for payment.
The transportation impact fee for a specific subdivision or land development
shall be paid prior to the issuance of the building permit for the
development. The transportation impact fee shall be paid to the Township
in cash, bank cashier's check, certified check, or electronic fund transfer
approved by the Township Manager and shall be administered by the
Township in accordance with the provisions of § 82-17.
§ 82-19. Credit.
Any applicant who shall perform, at its own expense and with the consent
and agreement of the Board of Supervisors, off-site improvements, as herein
defined, shall be eligible for a credit from a transportation impact fee
otherwise due. Such credit shall not exceed the amount of the
transportation impact fee that would have been charged if a credit was not
due.
A. Collection of transportation impact fees due pursuant to this article
shall be by the Township in the manner or manners prescribed herein
prior to the issuance of a building permit.
B. Establishment of the fund. Upon receipt of transportation impact fees,
the Township Manager shall be responsible for the separate and proper
accounting of such fees. All such fees shall be deposited in interestbearing
accounts in a bank authorized to receive deposits of the
Township funds. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to
that account and shall be used solely for the purpose specified for funds
of such account.
C. Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Township Manager
shall establish appropriate trust fund accounts and shall maintain
records whereby transportation impact fees collected can be
segregated for each Transportation Service Area.

keep adequate financial records for each such account which shall show
the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all
monies received, and which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds
from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision
of projects specified in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
for the particular Transportation Service Area.
A. If the applicant makes such improvements, he shall enter into an
agreement with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of any
building permit. The agreement shall establish the estimated cost of the
improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the
improvement, a requirement that the improvement be completed to
Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and design criteria, as applicable, and such other terms and conditions
as deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors. The Board of

§ 82-20. Refunds.
Transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be
refunded, together with interest earned thereon, to the payor of the
transportation impact fees under the following circumstances:
Supervisors shall review the improvement plan, verify costs and time
schedules, determine if the improvement is an eligible improvement,
and determine the amount of the applicable credit for such
improvement to be applied to the otherwise applicable transportation
impact fee prior to issuance of any building permit. The amount of such
credit for any capital improvement constructed shall be the amount
allocated in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan, including
contingency factors, for such improvement. In no event shall the Board
of Supervisors provide a credit, which is greater than the applicable
transportation impact fee. If, however, the amount of the credit is
calculated to be greater than the amount of the transportation impact
fee due, the applicant may use such excess credit toward the
transportation impact fees imposed on other building permits for
development on the same site and in the same ownership. Any such
applicant shall be required to supply financial security sufficient, in
the judgment of the Township, to cover the cost of any improvement
installed by the applicant for which credit is sought.
B. An applicant shall be entitled as a credit against transportation impact
fees an amount equal to the fair market value of land dedicated by the
applicant to the Township and accepted by the Township for future
right-of-way, realignment or widening of existing roadways. The fair
market value of any land dedicated to and accepted by the Township
shall be determined as of the date of the submission of the subdivision
or land development application to the Township.
A. In the event the Township terminates or completes the Transportation
Capital Improvements Plan and there remains at the time of
termination or completion undisbursed funds, the respective payors
shall be entitled to a share of the fund balance in the same proportion
as the payor's transportation impact fee payment plus interest earned
bears to the total transportation impact fees collected plus interest. The
Township shall provide written notice by certified mail to each person
who previously paid the fees and remain undisbursed, that such
person's proportionate share of the fund balance is available for refund
to such person. Such notice shall be provided to the last-known address
provided by the payor of the transportation impact fees to the
Township. In the event that any of the funds remain unclaimed
following one year after the notice, the Township shall be authorized to
transfer any funds so remaining to any other fund in the Township
without any further obligation to refund said funds. It shall be the
responsibility of the payor to provide the Township at all times with a
current address for such notice.

development or provision of public improvements which remain subject
to applicable zoning, subdivision and land development, and planned
residential development regulations of the Township, which shall be
operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect
to such development.
§ 82-23. Fee as additional and supplemental requirement.
The transportation impact fee is additional and supplemental to, and not
in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the Township on the
development of land or the issuance of building permits. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to alter or affect the Township's existing
ordinances and regulations regarding on-site improvements. In no event
shall a property owner be obligated to pay for transportation capital
B. In the event the Township fails to commence construction within three
years of the scheduled construction dates of the project as set forth in
the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan, the Township shall
refund the portion of the transportation impact fee paid by any payor
making written request therefor, which is attributable to said project,
with accumulated interest; provided, nevertheless, that no refund shall
be payable or paid with respect to any project actually commenced
prior to the receipt of such refund request, and the failure of a payor to
make such written request prior to the commencement of such project
shall be deemed a waiver of any right to such refund.
C. In the event that, upon completion of any road improvements project,
the actual expenditures for the project are less than 95% of the
budgeted costs for such project, the Township shall refund the pro rata
difference between the budgeted costs and the actual expenditures,
including interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment, to
the person or persons who paid the impact fees for such improvements.
D. In the event the development for which transportation impact fees were
paid has not commenced prior to the expiration of the building permit
issued therefor, the transportation impact fees paid with accumulated
interest shall be refunded to the payor. Further, if a building permit
after issuance is altered in such a way as to reduce the amount of the
transportation impact fee due, the difference between such amount and
the amount actually paid shall be refunded. The payor, at its option, may
roll over the transportation impact fees attributable to an expired
building permit to cover fees incurred by a required permit.

improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to
this article; provided, nevertheless, that a property owner may be required
to pay, pursuant to Township ordinances, regulations or policies, for other
public facilities in addition to the transportation impact fee as provided
herein.
§ 82-24. Construal of provisions.
It is hereby found and declared to be the intention of the Township that
the public health, safety, and welfare be protected and furthered by the
provisions of this article, and it shall be interpreted and construed liberally
to effectively carry out its purposes and in such manner as to favor such
public interest as opposed to any private interest.
§ 82-25. Retroactive applicability.
Notwithstanding § 82-26 herein, transportation impact fees shall be
imposed on those projects involving subdivisions, land developments, and
planned residential developments for which an application has been filed
on or after the first publication of notice of the intent of the Township to
adopt this article; provided, nevertheless, that such retroactivity does not
exceed 18 months after the adoption of the resolution that created the
Transportation Impact Fee Advisory Committee.

This article shall take effect five days after adoption by the Board of
Supervisors.

ARTICLE II
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 89-4. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
§ 89-5. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. Any areas of the Township, classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2, 2016, and issued
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most
recent official version thereof adopted by FEMA, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study and the abovereferenced
FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the Township and declared to be a
part of this chapter. For purposes of coordination with the UCC, the
identified floodplain area shall be considered the Flood Hazard Map
referenced in IBC 2009 Sec. 1612.
A. The Floodway Area/District (FW) is identified as floodway in the FIS
which represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no
floodway has been delineated.
(1) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
§ 89-4 FIREWORKS § 89-5
87:121
§ 89-6. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Limerick
Township Board of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a
qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must
be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, a
community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the Special Flood Hazard
Area by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 89-7. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain area boundary arise,
an initial determination shall be made by the Limerick Township Engineer
and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Limerick Township Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on
the appellant.
§ 89-8. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the base flood elevation more
than one foot at any point.
(2) No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any
watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no onepercent-
annual chance flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by Limerick Township.
§ 89-5 LIMERICK CODE § 89-8

87:137
§ 89-24. Placards.
In addition to the permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a placard
which shall be displayed on the premises during the time construction is in
progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit, the date of its
issuance, and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 89-25. Determination of start of construction.
Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180
days after the date of issuance and shall be completed within 12 months
after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall expire unless a
time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The
actual start of construction means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is
submitted by the applicant, which sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause
for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request.
§ 89-26. Enforcement.
A. Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this
chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state;

shaper, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is not possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
authorization of relief is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the relief, is granted, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood where the property is located, nor

unacceptable or prohibited increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, nor create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with any other applicable local or state ordinances and regulations,
including, but not limited to:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
§ 89-28 LIMERICK CODE § 89-28

loss provision is used), regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions. Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation
that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter,
must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation
that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure
from the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of
historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or
the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance
requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by The Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to

Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
reference, as the construction standard applicable with the state floodplain
construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
§ 89-29 FIREWORKS § 89-29
87:147
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A

certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
§ 89-30. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 89-31. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the Ordinance, which shall remain
in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter
are hereby declared to be severable.
§ 89-32. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within
such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages. Chapter 89 of the
Limerick Township Code shall not create liability on the part of Limerick
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

reservation requests at the Committee's regular meeting during
the month of February. Representatives of the persons or groups
requesting such long-term reservations are required to attend the
February meeting of the Limerick Township Parks and Recreation
Commission to assist in resolving any scheduling conflicts. At the
February meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee will tentatively
assign reservations, attempting to accommodate all requests. In the
case of competing requests for the same facilities at the same times, the
Parks and Recreation Committee will encourage cooperation in
modifying requests to resolve the schedule conflicts. If the conflict
cannot be resolved, preference shall be given to the group
demonstrating the largest number of Limerick Township residents
enrolled, registered or participating in the program for which the
reserved facilities are sought.

Recreation Committee at its regularly scheduled meeting during the
month of March. After the reservation schedule has been announced by
the Board of Supervisors, each group assigned reserved facilities shall
submit a signed agreement, certificate of insurance, and any fees
required within 10 business days to the Township, or the reservation
will be forfeited. After the March meeting of the Parks and Recreation
Committee, additional reservations may be made on a first-come, firstserved
basis in accordance with the availability of the facilities within
the parklands. Such reservations shall be made in writing on forms
provided by the Township at least 10 business days prior to the date of
the event for which the reservation is sought.
I. Insurance requirements. All groups reserving the exclusive use of any
portion of or facilities within the parklands for more than seven days in
a calendar year shall obtain and maintain liability insurance for the
benefit of such group, making the Township a named insured, as

Public Water Ordinance."
§ 133-2. Background; legislative intent.
It has been determined by the Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) that an area located in Limerick Township has been contaminated.
The area is identified on Exhibit "A" as "Impact Area 1," which is attached
hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit A.64 This article mandates the
connection and continued connection of all improved properties in the
impacted area to either the water lines to be constructed by the Township or
to the existing water lines of Pennsylvania American Water in the impacted
area. The water lines and the existing water lines of Pennsylvania American
Water in the impacted area are collectively referred to as the "Public Water
System," and constitute a public water system of Limerick Township. Water
for the public water system will be provided by Pennsylvania American
Water (the "water utility"). This article is enacted to require the mandatory
connection of all properties in the impacted area to the public water system.
§ 133-3. Connection requirements.
A. All improved properties located within the impacted area, whose
addresses are listed in Exhibit A,65 shall connect to the public water
system within 60 days following written notice to connect from the
Township.
B. In addition to the properties required to connect under § 133-2A, all
properties located in the impacted area which are hereafter improved
with a residential building or hereafter improved with a nonresidential
building, which is occupied or capable of being occupied, shall connect
to the public water system within 60 days following written notice to
connect from the Township. Residential buildings or nonresidential
buildings constructed, renovated or improved on properties required to
connect shall connect to the public water system prior to any
habitation, occupancy, or use, and no certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for any such improved property unless and until such connection
has been made.

violation of this article for a period of 90 days after notice from the
Township to connect, then, in that event, the Township or its agents
may enter upon said property owner's property and construct the
connection to the public water system, and in that event, the costs of

be paid by DEP. The foregoing notwithstanding, where the owner of a
property listed in Exhibit A refuses to allow closure of the well on the
property for a period of 90 days from the date of the Township notice to
connect to the public water system, then the right of the property
owner to receive payment of the cost of the closure of the well shall
terminate, provided the Township first gives 30 days' written notice of
such termination to the property owner with opportunity for a hearing
before the Board of Supervisors of the Township. In addition, if the
property owner shall fail to perform or refuse to allow the disconnection
and closure of the private well within 90 days from the date of the

§ 135-1. Purpose and findings of fact.
A The purpose of this article shall be to protect and promote the public
health, safety and welfare of the Township's citizens and emergency
services responders, to establish rights and obligations of owners and
occupants relating to residential rental properties in the Township and
to encourage owners and occupants to maintain and improve the quality
of life and quality of rental housing within the Township. To accomplish
such goals, this article provides for the systematic registration, licensing
and inspection of residential rental properties within the Township, and
penalties, to ensure said properties are in compliance with applicable
Township-adopted building, property maintenance, fire, and other codes
and regulations.
A. In considering the adoption of this article, the Township makes the
following findings:
(1) There is a growing concern in the community with the appearance
and physical condition of many residential rental properties;
(2) There is a perception and appearance of greater incidence of
problems with the maintenance and upkeep of residential
properties which are not owner-occupied as compared to those that
are owner-occupied;
(3) Violations of maintenance codes are generally less severe and more
quickly corrected at owner-occupied properties as compared to
renter occupied residential rental properties;
(4) A residential rental inspection program can avoid life-threatening
problems, such as lack of functioning smoke detectors, faulty
mechanical equipment and inadequate or unsafe electrical
equipment;
(5) The Township is concerned with the condition of a property when
emergency services respond, and for the safety of such emergency
responders and general safety of the occupants;
(6) The Township desires to account for the number of renteroccupied,
residential rental properties to further the accountability
and safety of the property occupants;
(7) This Chapter is enacted under the authority of the Second Class
Township Code, 53 P.S. § 6601 et seq., and likewise in accordance
to applicable provisions of the Landlord-Tenant Act of 1951, the
67.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Ch. 135, Rental Property, adopted
12-3-1991 by Ord. No. 137.

General Provisions
§ 151-1. Short title.
Short title. This chapter shall be known as the "Limerick Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 151-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines the identified floodplain areas management and flood
reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
[Amended 3-15-2016 by Ord. No. 366]
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns,
accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment, and activities
causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of
the people of the municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream base flow, and aquatic
ecosystems. The most cost-effective and environmentally advantageous
way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project
design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoids sensitive
areas (i.e., stream buffers, identified floodplain areas steep slopes), and
§ 151-1 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 151-2

§ 151-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the municipality by maintaining the natural hydrologic
regime and minimizing the impacts through provisions designed to:
considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic
regime. [Amended 3-15-2016 by Ord. No. 366]
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
A. Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the
impacts on surface water and groundwater.
B. Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
C. Minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume.
D. Minimize impervious surfaces.
E. Manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause these problems.
F. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
G. Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
I. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to
otherwise protect water resources.
J. Maintain existing base flows and quality of streams and watercourses,
where possible.
K. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at Chapter 93.4a of Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code
requiring protection and maintenance of "existing uses" and

§ 151-18 LIMERICK CODE § 151-20
122:292
A. The design of all regulated activities shall include the following to
minimize stormwater impacts.
(1) The applicant shall find practicable alternatives to the surface
discharge of stormwater, such as those listed in Appendix E, Table
E-4,111 the creation of impervious surfaces, and the degradation of
waters of the commonwealth and must maintain, as much as
possible, the natural hydrologic regime of the site.

implementation after taking into consideration existing technology
and logistics in light of overall project purposes and other
municipal requirements.
(3) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are
presumed to have less adverse impact on quantity and quality of
waters of the commonwealth unless otherwise demonstrated.
B. The applicant shall demonstrate that the regulated activities were
designed in the following sequence. The goal of the sequence is to
minimize the increases in stormwater runoff and impacts to water
quality resulting from the proposed regulated activity.
(1) Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM)
showing environmentally sensitive areas, including, but not limited
to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands, hydric soils,
vernal pools, stream buffers, hydrologic soil groups, wooded areas,
and potential infiltration areas. Land development, any existing
recharge areas, and other requirements outlined in the municipal
SALDO shall also be included.
(2) Establish a stream buffer according to § 151-22G.
(3) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas identified in
§ 151-20B(1).
(4) Identify site-specific existing conditions drainage areas, discharge
points, recharge areas, and hydrologic soil groups A and B (areas
conducive to infiltration). Infiltration should still be considered in
well-draining soils listed as hydrologic soil group C, but additional
soils testing should be performed to verify on-site conditions and
placement of these BMPs.
(5) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives:
(a) Minimize earth disturbance.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(c) Break up large impervious surfaces.

§ 151-20 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 151-20
122:293
§ 151-21. Groundwater recharge.
Maximizing the groundwater recharge capacity of the area being developed
is required. Design of the infiltration facilities shall consider groundwater
recharge to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs when
the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created. It is
recommended that roof runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs that may be
designed to compensate for the runoff from parking areas. These measures
are required to be consistent with § 151-3 and to take advantage of utilizing
any existing recharge areas. Infiltration may not be feasible on every site
due to site-specific limitations such as soil type. If it cannot be physically
accomplished, then the design professional shall be responsible to show
that this cannot be physically accomplished. Appropriate soils testing and/
or geotechnical evaluation should be included as part of any documentation
for infiltration BMPs. If it can be physically accomplished, then the volume
of runoff to be infiltrated shall be determined from § 151-21A(2).
(6) Satisfy the groundwater recharge (infiltration) objective § 151-21,
and provide for stormwater pretreatment prior to infiltration.
(7) Provide for water quality protection in accordance with § 151-22
water quality requirements.
(8) Provide streambank erosion protection in accordance with § 151-23
streambank erosion requirements.
(9) Determine into what management district the site falls (Appendix
A),112 and conduct an existing conditions runoff analysis.
(10) Prepare final project design to maintain existing conditions
drainage areas and discharge points, to minimize earth disturbance
and impervious surfaces, and, to the maximum extent possible, to
ensure that the remaining site development has no surface or point
discharge.
(11) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final
design that meets the management district requirements
(§ 151-24).
(12) Manage any remaining runoff prior to discharge through detention,
bioretention, direct discharge, or other structural control.
A. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions
and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
112. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 151-20 LIMERICK CODE § 151-21
122:294
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches, preferably 36 inches, between
the bottom of the BMP and the top of the limiting zone (e.g.,
SHWT, groundwater, bedrock, etc.).
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater load and dewater completely as determined by
field tests conducted by the applicant's design professional.
(c) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely
infiltrating the recharge (infiltration) volume (Rev between 24
hours to 72 hours.
(d) Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(2) The size of the infiltration facility shall be based upon the net twoyear
volume approach, where the recharge (infiltration) volume
(Rev to be captured and infiltrated shall be the volume difference
between the predevelopment two-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event and postdevelopment two-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event.
(3) The recharge volume calculated using this section is the minimum
volume the applicant must control through an infiltration BMP
facility. However, if a site has areas of soils where additional
volume of recharge can be achieved, the applicant is encouraged to
infiltrate as much of the stormwater runoff from the site as
possible.
B. Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified design professional and at a minimum address
soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface)
to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required recharge volume
(Rev) based on field-determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface.
§ 151-21 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 151-21
122:295
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the municipality
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
C. Stormwater hotspots. Below is a list of examples of designated
hotspots. If a site is designated as a hotspot, it has important
implications for how stormwater is managed. First and foremost,
untreated stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be allowed to
recharge into groundwater where it may contaminate water supplies.
Therefore, the Rev requirement shall NOT be applied to development
sites that fit into the hotspot category (the entire WQv must still be
treated). Second, a greater level of stormwater treatment shall be
considered at hotspot sites to prevent pollutant washoff after
construction. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) NPDES
stormwater program requires some industrial sites to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan.
(1) Examples of hotspots:
(a) Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities.
(b) Vehicle fueling stations.
(c) Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
(d) Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
(e) Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
(f) Industrial sites based on Standard Industrial Codes.
(g) Marinas (service and maintenance).
(h) Outdoor liquid container storage.
(i) Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
(j) Public works storage areas.
(k) Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(l) Commercial container nursery.
(m) Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate
review authority.
(2) The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
(a) Residential streets and rural highways.
(b) Residential development.
(c) Institutional development.
(d) Office developments.
§ 151-21 LIMERICK CODE § 151-21
122:296
§ 151-22. Water quality requirements.
The applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements of
this article:
(e) Nonindustrial rooftops.
(f) Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries [which may
need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
(3) While large highways [average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater
than 30,000] are not designated as stormwater hotspots, it is
important to ensure that highway stormwater management plans
adequately protect groundwater.
D. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
SWPAs as defined by the local municipality or water authority.
E. Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative
or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities, and nonstructural
stormwater management alternatives.
F. Extreme caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride (municipal
salt storage) would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater. The qualified design
professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary. Specific consideration
should be given to the particular type of salt or deicing material to be
used within this watershed in regards to its potential long-term effects
on the soils, especially in areas that contain clay soil.
G. The infiltration requirement in HQ or EV waters shall be subject to the
Department's Chapter 93 antidegradation regulations.
H. An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed
hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the municipality.
I. The municipality shall require the applicant to provide safeguards
against groundwater contamination for land uses that may cause
groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan that
demonstrates compliance with post-construction state water quality
requirements.
B. The BMPs shall be designed, implemented, and maintained to meet
state water quality requirements and any other more-stringent
requirements as determined by the municipality.
§ 151-21 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 151-22
122:297
C. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions so that
post-construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical, or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure the
filtering out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(3) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and
rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
D. Storage and treatment facilities.
(1) Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. If site
conditions allow for infiltration, the water quality volume and the
recharge volume are the same volume and may be managed in a
single facility. If infiltration cannot be physically accomplished, the
water quality volume should be calculated using the net two-year
volume approach described in § 151-21A(2). In this case, the water
quality volume may be captured and treated by methods other than
infiltration BMPs.
(2) This volume requirement can be accomplished by the permanent
volume of a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs.
Where appropriate, wet basins shall be utilized for water quality
control and shall follow the guidelines of the BMP manuals
referenced in Appendix F.
(3) The water quality volume shall take a minimum of 24 hours to be
discharged from a BMP facility. Release of the water quality volume
can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water
quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design of the
facility shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.
E. For areas within defined special protection subwatersheds that include
EV and HQ waters, the temperature and quality of water and streams
shall be maintained through the use of temperature-sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems.
§ 151-22 LIMERICK CODE § 151-22
122:298
§ 151-23. Streambank erosion requirements.
F. To accomplish the above, the applicant shall submit original and
innovative designs to the Municipal Engineer for review and approval.
Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives through a
combination of different BMPs.
G. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a stream buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet
to either side of the top-of-bank of the channel. The buffer area shall be
maintained with and encouraged to use appropriate native vegetation.
(Refer to Appendix B of the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, latest version, for plant lists.) if the applicable rear or
side yard setback is less than 50 feet or a stream traverses the site, the
buffer width may be reduced to 25% of the setback and/or to a minimum
of 10 feet. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed,
covenant, easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this
chapter, the existing buffer shall be maintained. [NOTE: Limerick
Township may select a smaller buffer width (above) if desired, but the
selected buffer may not be less than 10 feet]. This does not include
lakes or wetlands.
H. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the municipality. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of § 151-22A.
A. In addition to the control of water quality volume (in order to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream streambank erosion),
the primary requirement is to design a BMP to detain the proposed
conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm to the existing
conditions one-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution.
Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at
the bottom of the outlet structure) so that the proposed conditions oneyear
storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a
point where the maximum volume of water from the one-year storm is
captured (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).
B. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter where possible, and a trash rack shall be
installed to prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas
contributing to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume to
allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the
calculations shall be submitted showing this condition. Orifice sizes less
than three inches can be utilized, provided that the design will prevent
clogging of the intake.

§ 151-24. Stormwater peak rate control.
§ 151-25. Calculation methodology.
A. Peak rate control.
(1) Within the Swamp Creek watershed, the criteria for peak runoff
rate control are designed to reduce the post-development peak flow
to 50% of the predevelopment peak flow. Development sites must
control proposed conditions runoff rates to 50% of the existing
conditions runoff rates for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-,
and one-hundred-year storm events.
(2) For all other areas of the Township, the design storm criteria for
peak runoff rate control are designed to reduce the postdevelopment
peak flow to the predevelopment peak flow.
Development sites must control proposed conditions runoff rates to
the existing conditions runoff rates for the two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm events.
B. The calculated peak discharges within the Swamp Creek Watershed
shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the
drainage area by subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if
discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site.
In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release
rate, provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted
average release rate.
C. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed
to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
D. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the peak rate control standards noted above. In other
words, unimpacted areas bypassing the stormwater management
facilities would not be subject to the peak rate control standards.
E. Alternate criteria for redevelopment sites. For redevelopment sites, one
of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished,
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions as
determined by Limerick Township:
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Subsections A through D;
or
(2) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%,
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to
proposed impervious surface.
§ 151-24 LIMERICK CODE § 151-25
122:300
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex
Method. Table 151-25 summarizes acceptable computation methods,
and the method selected by the design professional shall be based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. Note that successors to the methods listed in Table 151-25 are also
acceptable, such as WinTR55 for TR-55 and WinTR20 for TR-20. The
municipality may allow the use of the Rational Method to estimate peak
discharges from drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres. The
Soil Cover Complex Method shall be used for drainage areas greater
than 200 acres.

C. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used in determining the existing conditions flow rates shall
be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." A site shall be considered to be a wooded site
where a biological community dominated by trees and other
woody plants exists that covers an area of 10,000 square feet
or more and contains at least 100 trees with at least 50% of
those trees having a dbh of two inches or greater. (Duerksen,
Christopher J., with Suzanne Richman, Tree Conservation
Ordinances, Planning Advisory Service Report Number 446,
American Planning Association, Chicago, Illinois, and Scenic
America, Washington, D.C., August, 1993.)
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare
earth, and fallow ground shall be considered as "meadow in
good condition," unless the natural ground cover generates a
lower curve number (CN) or Rational "C" value (i.e., woods) as
listed in Table E-2 or E-3 in Appendix E of this chapter.114
(c) Off-site land use conditions used to determine storm flows for
designing storm facilities shall be based on existing land uses
assuming winter or poor land cover conditions.
(2) For development considered redevelopment sites, the ground cover
used in determining the existing conditions flow rates for the
developed portion of the site shall be based upon actual land cover
conditions.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for overland flow
and return periods presented in the appropriate curves from the
PennDOT Storm-Duration-Frequency Chart. (Region 4 is included in
Figure E-3. The user should refer to the Atlas 14, Volume 2, Storm-
Duration-Frequency Chart.) Times-of-concentration for overland flow
shall be calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or
replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times-of-concentration for
channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's Equation.
E. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from
Table E-2 in Appendix E of this chapter.115

coefficient (n) shall be consistent with accepted published values.
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the

Indication Method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed
using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The
municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.

stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit under
DEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with
Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning
dam safety. Chapter 105 may be required to pass storms larger
than the one-hundred-year event.

B. Activities which are exempt from the grading requirements of this
section (§ 151-51). The following activities require no grading review:
(1) Improvements, such as driveway paving, minor regrading or
activities on a property which do not adversely affect the natural
overland or subsurface flow of stormwater or the drainage of any
premises or adversely disturb the landscape.
(2) Farming, gardening, lawn installation or lawn restoration.
(3) Work within the ultimate right-of-way of a public street or alleyway
to be offered for dedication or previously ordained by the Township,
county or commonwealth, or any park, playground, recreation area
or open space dedicated to and accepted by the Township, county
or commonwealth.
C. Standards for grading activities. Except for those activities exempted
by § 151-51B, the following standards shall apply to all activities
permitted or allowed under §§ 151-5 and § 151-6 of this chapter:
(1) The permittee is responsible for the prevention of damage to other
property or personal injury, which may be affected by the activity
requiring an approval.
(2) No person, firm or corporation shall modify, fill, excavate, pave,
grade or regrade land in any manner so close to a property line as
to endanger or damage any adjoining street or alley or any other
public or private property without supporting and protecting such
property from settling, cracking, erosion, sediment, flooding or any
other physical damage or personal injury which might result.
(3) Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this section, no
person, firm or corporation shall cause or allow to be removed
greater than 50% of the existing topsoil from any site, and in no

a conditional permit, which permit shall be issued to modify the
terms of this section only based upon sound engineering practices
and subject to appeal by any party in interest, including the
applicant, the Township or any other interested or affected party
filing an appeal to be heard by the Township Board of Supervisors
in the same manner as an application or petition to rezone. Further,
it is the intention of this section to achieve conservation of both

tests and that, in his opinion, such steeper slopes will safely
support the proposed fill.
(b) Natural and/or existing slopes exceeding five horizontal to one
vertical shall be benched or continuously stepped into
competent materials prior to placing all classes of fill.

Design Standards
§ 155-13. General standards.
The following principles of subdivision and land development, general
requirements and minimum standards of design shall be observed by the
applicant in all instances:
A. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be included in lots, streets,
public lands or other proposed areas of use so that remnants and
landlocked areas shall not be created.
B. When only a portion of a tract is being reviewed relative to subdivision
and land development, but where future subdivision or development is
imminent, the applicant shall demonstrate, subject to approval of his
plan, that the remainder of the tract or parcel may be subdivided or
developed in conformance with the existing zoning classification of land
use in a logical and satisfactory manner.
C. Whenever possible, applicants shall preserve trees, groves, waterways,
scenic points, historic spots and other community assets and
landmarks.
D. Subdivisions and land developments should be laid out so as to avoid
the necessity for excessive cut or fill unless specifically warranted by
terrain or location.
E. Low-lying land subject to period flooding or land located in the
identified floodplain area shall be developed or subdivided in
accordance with the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.132
[Amended 4-4-1989 by Ord. No. 109; 3-15-2016 by Ord. No. 365]
F. Where no public water supply is available for the proposed subdivision
or land development, the Supervisors shall require the subdivider,
developer or builder to obtain from the District Sanitarian of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection certificates of
approval of the quality and adequacy of the water supply proposed to be
utilized by the subdivider, developer or builder and approval of the type
and construction methods to be employed in the installation of the
individual water supply system.133
G. Where the subdivision or land development is inaccessible to sanitary
sewers, the Supervisors shall require the subdivider, developer or
builder to obtain from the District Sanitarian of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection certificates of approval of the
sewage disposal facilities to be provided by the subdivider, developer or
builder.134

§ 155-14. Application of standards; recommendations of Planning
Commission.
H. Applicants shall observe the ultimate rights-of-way for contiguous
existing streets as prescribed by the Official Map Summary for the
Township. Additional portions of the corridors for such streets shall be
offered to the state, county or Township agency having jurisdiction at
the time the subdivision or land development is consummated.
Applicable building setback lines, as defined by the Limerick Township
Zoning Ordinance of current adoption,135 shall be delineated as
measured from the center line of the street.
I. Proposed subdivision and land development shall be coordinated with
existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may
develop harmoniously.
J. Improvement construction requirements will be completed in
accordance with specifications consistent with all other requirements
of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the
Montgomery County Conservation District or other appropriate
agencies or the specifications included herein, whichever specifications
shall result in the more stringent requirements being applied to the
applicant.
K. Construction of facilities. The subdivider, developer or builder shall,
where specified by the governing body, construct and install, at no
expense to the Township, the streets, curbs, sidewalks, water mains,
sanitary and storm sewers, streetlights, fire hydrants, street signs,
shade trees, monuments and other facilities and utilities specified in
this article. Construction and installation of such facilities and utilities
shall be subject to inspection by appropriate Township officials during
the progress of the work, and the subdivider shall pay for inspection.
A. The standards of design in this article should be used to judge the
adequacy of subdivision proposals. Wherever, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, the literal application of these standards in
certain cases would serve to create an undue hardship or be plainly
unreasonable to the applicant, the Township Planning Commission may
recommend to the Supervisors such reasonable exceptions as will not
be contrary to the public interest. The Supervisors may modify or adjust
the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while
securing substantial conformance with the objectives of these
regulations.
B. The standards included in these regulations are minimum design
requirements; however, the Supervisors of Limerick Township reserve
the right in any case to request that development features exceed these
standards if conditions so warrant.

by Ord. No. 109; 7-17-1990 by Ord. No. 117; 12-17-1991 by Ord. No.
141]
C. In reviewing subdivision plans, the Supervisors shall refer such plans to
the Planning Commission for recommendations concerning the
adequacy of existing and proposed community facilities to serve the
additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision.
D. Subdividers are required to provide adequate rights-of-way and paving
on existing streets, reserving areas and easements for facilities
normally required in residential sections, including churches, libraries,
schools and shopping and local business centers, as well as rights-ofway
and easements for storm and sanitary sewer facilities in those
areas that cannot immediately be joined to the existing and proposed
storm and sanitary sewer systems of Limerick Township.
E. Areas provided or served for such community facilities should be
adequate to provide for such building sites, landscaping and off-street
parking as are appropriate to the use proposed. The Supervisors
reserve the right to accept or refuse offers of dedication for public uses.
A. General principle.
(1) Proposed streets shall conform to the Township Comprehensive
Plan or to other adopted street plans.
(2) Proposed streets shall further conform to county and state street
and highway plans as prescribed by law.
(3) Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce
reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building
sites.
(4) Residential streets shall discourage through traffic but shall
provide for continuation of existing streets and provide access to
nearby tracts.
(5) If a portion of a tract is not subdivided or if lots are large enough to
permit future subdivision, adequate street right-of-way shall be
provided.
(6) Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except when designed as
culs-de-sac or as stubs. Stub streets may be permitted only to
provide future street extension into adjoining tracts and shall not
exceed one lot in depth or width unless a temporary cul-de-sac is
provided.
(7) Streets that are extensions of or in alignment with existing streets
shall bear the street names of such streets. All street names and
address numbers shall be subject to the approval of the Board of
Supervisors.
§ 155-14 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-15
122:367
(8) Half streets are prohibited.
(9) Private streets shall be developed according to the same standards
as public streets, unless these requirements are waived by the
Board of Supervisors.
(10) Existing streets are classified on Table 3.136 New streets shall be
classified by the Planning Commission during sketch plan review
according to function, design and use. For example, a street within
a subdivision may be designated as a collector if it serves that
function.
(11) The minimum right-of-way width for development along existing
streets shall correspond to the ultimate right-of-way for these
streets, as defined herein.
(a) The area between an existing right-of-way line and the ultimate
right-of-way line shall be offered for dedication to the authority
having jurisdiction over the road when land is subdivided or
developed along an existing right-of-way.
(b) No new fences, trees, shrubbery, walls, plantings or other
obstructions shall be permitted within the right-of-way, except
in village areas where front yards may fall within the right-ofway
or in areas where future street widening is considered
unlikely and sight distance is not obstructed.
[1] The Township Supervisors may require removal of any
such right-of-way obstructions to improve sight distance or
as necessary for road improvements.
B. Street hierarchy and standards. The following standards are intended
as minimum standards and may be altered based on site or traffic
conditions. Cartway widths do not include additional turning lanes at
intersections or entrances. For a more detailed view of each type of
road, including shoulders, curbs, buffer area and turning lanes, refer to
Table 3 and the schematics in the appendix.137
(1) Limited access freeway. A limited access freeway is an expressway
with fully controlled access, intended to provide safe and efficient
movement of high volumes of traffic at relatively high speeds.
Through traffic is given preference, with access permitted only at
interchanges with selected public roads. The Pottstown
Expressway, Route 422, is the only highway in Limerick classified
as a limited access freeway. Standards are as specified by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

122:368
(2) Principal arterial. A principal arterial is a street designed to
provide a relatively high-speed, high-volume network for travel
between major points. Direct access from adjacent properties
should be kept to a minimum, and grade level intersections should
be spaced at large enough intervals to facilitate the safe and
convenient flow of traffic. The characteristics of principal arterials
will change depending on surrounding land uses and their
densities. [Amended 6-17-1997 by Ord. No. 189]

(3) A minor arterial interconnects with and augments principal
arterials. They accommodate trips of moderate length and
emphasize access to services. Minor arterials within the Township
are classified into Class One and Class Two, in order to deal with
different traffic volumes and land uses. [Amended 6-17-1997 by
Ord. No. 189]
(a) Minor arterial, Class One:
[1] Minimum right-of-way: 80 feet (right-of-way will widen

[3] Parking: not permitted.
[4] Sidewalks: four feet.
(4) Major collector. A major collector collects traffic from local streets
and channels it to arterials. They carry moderate traffic volumes at
moderate speeds and connect roads to a higher classification.
Major collectors also connect Limerick and nearby communities,
such as the Boroughs of Schwenksville and Royersford. [Amended

D. Sidewalks. [Amended 6-17-1997 by Ord. No. 189]
(1) Sidewalks and/or graded areas shall be required along all roads, in
accordance with Table 3.139 Table 3 at the end of this chapter shall
serve as a general guide regarding where sidewalks should be
provided. However, the Board of Supervisors shall have the
authority to require sidewalks along any street where they are
deemed to be needed, regardless of the provisions of Table 3.
[Amended 11-4-1998 by Ord. No. 197]
(a) Sidewalks shall be required, as deemed appropriate by the
Board of Supervisor, to connect commercial centers, schools
and parks towards residential areas, among other situations.
The Board of Supervisors may require the construction of a
pedestrian pathway into and through a commercial
development to provide connections with residential areas,
regardless of whether a street is involved.
(b) Where public pedestrian access is provided outside of the
public right-of-way, the Township may require the
establishment of a pedestrian easement.
(c) The Board of Supervisors may approve alternative materials
and placements of pedestrian pathways in place of traditional
concrete sidewalks within the street right-of-way. This may
include, but is not limited to, pathways of asphalt that also
allow use by bicycles. Surfaces that are not wheelchair
accessible shall only be approved in unusual circumstances,
such as where necessary to protect important natural areas.
(d) Where a paved path or sidewalk is not required, the Township
may require the improvement of a graded grass area along the
cartway that is suitable for and required to be kept clear for
pedestrian use.
(2) In conventional developments, sidewalks shall be placed in the
right-of-way, parallel to the street. Exceptions may be made to
preserve topographic or natural features or to provide visual
interest or if the applicant shows that an alternative pedestrian
system provides safe and convenient circulation.
(3) In planned developments, sidewalks may be located away from the
road system to link groups of dwelling units with other dwelling
units, the street, parking areas, recreation areas and other activity
centers. Sidewalks may also be required parallel to the street for
safety reasons.
139. Editor's Note: Table 3 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 155-15 LIMERICK CODE § 155-15
122:372
(4) Pedestrian easements 10 feet in width may be required through the
center of blocks more than 600 feet long to provide circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping or other community
facilities.
(5) Sidewalks shall be constructed according to the Township
Improvements Construction Manual.
(6) The sidewalk widths listed in this article shall be considered
minimums. The Board of Supervisors may require greater widths in
areas subject to heavy pedestrian traffic, i.e., close to schools and
parks.
E. Special purpose streets.
(1) Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets are streets that terminate in a
vehicular turnaround, either permanent or temporary. Temporary
culs-de-sac are those constructed to an abutting property line with
the intention that such road will be extended onto the adjoining
property at a future date as a logical step in the circulation network
of the area. Temporary culs-de-sac shall be required by the Board of
Supervisors when conditions so warrant. Permanent culs-de-sac
provide access only to abutting lots within the tract being
subdivided or developed. Both temporary and permanent culs-desac:
(a) Shall be constructed to the specifications for residential streets
herein.
(b) Shall have a turnaround with a minimum right-of-way radius of
60 feet (at which frontage requirements shall be measured)
and an outer paving radius of 40 feet. In the case of a
temporary cul-de-sac, the cul-de-sac area outside of the
required street right-of-way width shall be provided as an
easement to the Township and shall be returned to the abutting
property owners at such time as the street is extended.
Frontage requirements for lots fronting a temporary cul-de-sac
shall be based upon the frontage of the extended street.
(c) Will not be approved when a through street is practicable.
(d) Shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length or serve more than 12
units, unless special conditions warrant approval by the
Supervisors.
(2) Alleys. Alleys are public or private streets which provide secondary
rear access to lots with narrow widths (for example in village
districts) in order to avoid excessive numbers of curb cuts on
residential streets.
§ 155-15 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-15
122:373
(a) Frontage on an alley shall not be construed as satisfying the
requirements of this chapter or Chapter 184, Zoning,
regarding frontage on an approved street.
(b) No parking shall be provided for or permitted within the rightof-
way of the alley.
(c) Street systems of which alleys are a part shall be designed not
to encourage through traffic on alleyways.
(d) Alleys may only intersect minor collectors, local roads or
subdivision streets. All alleys must intersect with streets at
both ends unless the alley terminates in a common parking lot
or other service area properly designed for maneuvering
service vehicles.
(e) Alley length from intersection to intersection may not exceed
600 feet.
(f) Minimum right-of-way width: 16 feet.
(g) Minimum cartway width: 12 feet.
(h) All alleys shall be furnished with some type of rigid edge
stabilization, such as dish curbs, flush curbs and precast
pavers, to prevent pavement edge unraveling.
(i) Building setback. Garages or parking stalls shall be set back a
minimum of 15 feet from the center line of any alley.
F. Street intersections.
(1) Number of intersections. No more than two streets shall cross at
the same point. Four-way intersections are to be avoided when
three-way or T-intersection can be utilized. When existing streets
intersect at odd angles or have more than four approaches, the
subdivider, developer or builder shall be required to make
corrective changes.
(2) Minimum angle of intersections. Right-angle intersections shall be
used whenever practicable, especially when local streets empty
into arterial or collector streets. No intersection angle may be less
than 75°, measured at the center line.
(3) Center lines. Where center lines of local streets are located on
opposite sides of an arterial or collector street within 100 feet of
each other, they shall be made to coincide by curving one of the
local streets.
(4) Intersection spacing. Street intersections are to be spaced
minimum distances apart as specified below, whether on the same
or opposite sides of the street. The minimum distance between
§ 155-15 LIMERICK CODE § 155-15
122:374
intersections shall be measured along the higher classification
street between the center lines of the intersecting streets:
(a) Principal arterial: 1,200 feet.
(b) Minor arterial: 600 feet.
(c) Major collector: 600 feet.
(d) Minor collector: 400 feet.
(e) Local streets: 200 feet.
(5) Sight triangles.
(a) Proper sight lines as provided by current PennDOT regulations
shall be maintained at all street intersections. Clear-sight
triangles shall be maintained along all approaches to
intersections and shall be measured along street center lines
from their point of intersection, as listed below:
[1] Arterial streets: 125 feet.
[2] Collector streets: 100 feet.
[3] Local streets: 75 feet.
(b) Where streets of different classifications intersect, the
dimension for the higher classification street shall be used.
(6) Obstructions within sight triangles. Within the sight triangle area,
no building, tree, hedge or other obstruction to visibility shall be
permitted, from curb to height to a minimum height of 12 feet, with
the following exceptions:
(a) One private sign post, provided that the post does not exceed
one foot square or diameter and the sign itself is above the
minimum height limit.
(b) One shade tree, provided that as the tree grows, the lower
branches are kept pruned to the minimum height limit.
(c) Existing shade trees, provided that the lower branches are
kept pruned up to the minimum height limit and the
arrangement of trees does not impede adequate visibility.
(7) Radii of pavement and right-of-way at intersections. The
appropriate radii for intersecting streets will depend upon many
factors: traffic volume, traffic speeds, the angle of the intersection,
the width and the number of lanes on the intersecting streets and
the type of traffic to be accommodated. The following table
presents minimum standards for ninety-degree intersections. The
Board of Supervisors may require greater radii when warranted by
any of the above factors. See A Policy on Geometric Design of
§ 155-15 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-15
122:375
Highways and Streets by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for more detailed
specifications. Road intersections shall be rounded with tangential
arcs at pavement edges (curblines) and right-of-way lines as listed
below. Where two streets of different right-of-way widths intersect,
the radii of curvature for the widest street shall apply.

G. Street alignment. Sight distance, horizontal and vertical curvature and
maximum and minimum street grades shall be provided on all streets in
compliance with the standards contained in this section.
(1) Sight distance. Proper sight distance shall be provided with respect
to both horizontal and vertical alignments. Sight distances shall be
determined in accordance with PennDOT's Title 67, Transportation
Publication, Chapter 441, as appendixed in the Township
Improvements Construction Manual.
(2) Horizontal curvature. Horizontal curves shall be used at all
changes in direction in excess of 2° and shall consider distance,
change in grade and alignment. The following standards shall be
used:
(a) Minimum curve radius at center line:
[1] Arterial streets: 300 feet.
[2] Collector and local streets: 200 feet.
[3] Residential streets:* 150 feet.
*NOTE: This requirement may be waived for residential
streets in cases where small lot sizes or other constraints
make a rectilinear street layout preferable. In these
cases, sharper curves may be used if the street does not
exceed 200 feet in length. A stop sign may be required
in cases where the street turns at a right angle
[approximately 90°].
§ 155-15 LIMERICK CODE § 155-15
122:376
(b) Curves and tangents.
[1] Long radius curves shall be used rather than a series of
shorter radius curves connected by tangents.
[2] On all arterial and collector streets, reverse curves shall
be separated by a tangent of at least 100 feet in length.
[3] Curve-tangent relationships shall follow accepted
engineering guidelines for safety and efficiency.
(c) Super-elevation. Arterial and collector streets shall be superelevated
in compliance with accepted engineering standards
when a curve radius of less than 600 feet is used.
(d) Approaches to intersections. Approaches to intersections shall
follow a straight course for a minimum of 50 feet for local
streets. All other streets shall follow a straight course for a
minimum of 100 feet.
(3) Vertical curvature. Vertical curves shall be used at changes in
grade of more than 1%, in compliance with the following
requirements:
(a) Curve length shall approximate the following for each 1%
change:
[1] Arterial streets: 250 feet or as required by PennDOT.
[2] Collector streets: 50 feet.
[3] Local streets: 25 feet.
(b) The high point or low point on a vertical curve shall be clearly
identified on plans and profiles, as appropriate.
(c) Over summits or in sumps, vertical curves shall not produce
excessive flatness in grade.
(4) Street grades. All streets shall be graded as shown on the street
profile and cross-section plans submitted and approved with the
preliminary plan for the subdivision or land development. Street
grades shall comply with the following:
(a) Minimum grade for all streets shall be 1%.
(b) Maximum grades for streets shall be:
[1] Arterial and collector streets: 7% or as required by
PennDOT.
[2] Local streets: 10% for distances of not more than 500 feet.
(c) Street grades in excess of 5% shall be avoided wherever
possible.
§ 155-15 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-15

12-17-1991 by Ord. No. 141]
distances between the center lines of the entrances of subdivisions
and land developments and any existing street intersections shall
be maximized.
(5) Each lot shall provide for fully coordinated traffic access with
adjacent lots zoned for compatible development, in a manner that
minimizes the number of access points onto major roads and
minimizes the need for customers to enter and exit arterial streets
when visiting more than one use. To the maximum extent feasible,
as determined by the Board of Supervisors, each commercial lot
shall include a driveway connection with adjacent commercial lots.
An access easement shall be provided for traffic from the adjacent
use to cross the lot to reach a driveway or intersection.
(a) Where the adjacent property owner will not cooperate to
permit the connection, provisions for the cross-connection may
still be required by the Board of Supervisors in case the
adjacent property is changed in use or expanded in the future.

coordinated interior access system or where the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that such
connection is not feasible.
(6) All entrances and exits shall be designed and constructed by the
applicant in accordance with accepted traffic engineering
principles, including appropriate widening, turning lanes,
acceleration/deceleration areas and traffic control devices, in order
to minimize interference with other traffic on the street and
provide safe and efficient access to the site.
(7) The Board of Supervisors shall require one or more of the following
methods of layout and site design if the Board determines such
method will be reasonable, feasible and necessary to control
increased traffic congestion and improve traffic safety.

A. Driveways. The requirements for driveways shall be the standards of
PennDOT regarding access to and occupancy of highways by driveways
and local roads (Pennsylvania Code, Title 67, Chapter 441, as
amended). (Refer to Township Improvements Construction Manual.)
Driveway access to state highways shall be subject to the permit
process of that department. All driveways shall be subject to the
standards, requirements and processing of this section.
(1) Location.
(a) Driveways shall be located so as to provide reasonable sight
distance at intersections with streets.
(b) Driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in a
manner which will not cause interference to the traveling
public, a hazard to the free movement of normal highway
traffic or areas of traffic congestion.
(c) Distance from street intersection. Driveways shall be located
as far from street intersections as is reasonably possible but
not less than the following:
[1] Individual residential lots: 50 feet.
[2] Multifamily residential and nonresidential lots: 100 feet.
(d) Distance from property line. Driveways shall be located a
minimum of five feet from side or rear property lines.
(2) Number of driveways.
(a) All residential properties shall be limited to one curb cut. The
following standards shall apply to nonresidential properties:
[1] Properties with frontages of 100 feet or less shall be
limited to one curb cut.
[2] Not more than two curb cuts may be permitted for any
single property, tract or lot, for each street frontage. More
than two curb cuts per frontage may be permitted only
when anticipated traffic volumes warrant more than two
and when supported by a traffic study prepared by a
qualified traffic engineer.
(3) Access to arterial and collector streets.
(a) No more than five lots may have direct access to an arterial or
collector street. All the road frontage shall be considered a
part of this requirement for lands held in single ownership.
(b) Driveway access shall be at least 200 feet apart wherever
possible. Driveways shall be located to provide the greatest
possible sight distance in accordance with PennDOT
standards.
§ 155-16 LIMERICK CODE § 155-16

the driveway shall provide access to the street of lesser
classification.
B. Parking areas.
(1) Automobile parking facilities shall be provided off street in
accordance with requirements of Chapter 184, Zoning, of the Code
of the Township of Limerick and this chapter.
(2) At no time shall angle or perpendicular parking along the curbs of
local, public or private access roads or streets be permitted. All
parking lots and bays allowing any parking other than parallel shall
be physically separated from the cartway by a minimum of seven
feet and confined to barrier curbing.
(3) No less than 20 feet of open space shall be provided between the
curbline of any parking area and the outside wall of the dwelling
unit in residential areas.
(4) Parking may be permitted within side and/or rear yards when the
side and/or rear yards abut a district zoned industrial and/or
commercial; however, no parking shall be permitted within five feet
of a side or rear property line unless formal arrangements,
satisfactory to the Township, have been made for the establishment
of common parking facilities.
(5) In commercial and industrial districts, provisions for common
parking facilities are hereby encouraged in recognition of their
increased flexibility and efficiency. Subject to formal arrangements
between the proposed users of the common parking facilities,
satisfactory to the Township, the Zoning Hearing Board may reduce
the aggregate amount of required parking space upon
determination that greater efficiency is effected by joint use of the
common parking area. When common parking facilities are
approved, side and/or rear yard parking requirements may be
waived in order to establish unified and continuous parking areas.
In such cases, access drives and sidewalks shall be so aligned as to
maximize parking efficiency and minimize traffic congestion.
Entrances and exits must have clear site lines and good visibility so
that, both going in and coming out, drivers can see and cars can be
seen.
(6) Each parking stall shall include a rectangle with a width of 9.5 feet

(10) Pavement markings, curbing and landscaped parking islands shall
be placed within parking areas to force vehicles to use designated
routes. To the maximum extent feasible, the majority of traffic shall
be directed to an outer loop which then filters traffic to parking
aisles, as opposed to directing traffic to the front entrances of
businesses, in order to reduce traffic conflicts with major
pedestrian crossings. [Added 11-4-1998 by Ord. No. 197]
C. Parking lot landscaping.
(1) Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs
to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights and parking lot
lights, to delineate driving lanes and to define rows of parking.
Furthermore, parking lots should be adequately shaded in order to
reduce the amount of reflected heat.
(2) All parking lots with 10 or more stalls shall be landscaped
according to the following regulations:

§ 155-17.1 LIMERICK CODE § 155-18
122:386
§ 155-19. Lots.
(1) Whenever practicable, blocks shall be of such width as to provide
two tiers of lots of the minimum size permitted under the
applicable zoning classification, except in the case of lots along a
major thoroughfare where the lots front on an interior street.
(2) Through lots. Double-frontage lots are to be avoided and generally
will not be permitted except where reversed frontage is desired
away from a major thoroughfare to a street of lesser traffic volume.
C. Crosswalks. Crosswalks not less than 10 feet wide and with concrete
paving not less than four feet wide may be required where necessary to
provide access to schools, churches, parks and commercial areas. They
shall be maintained by the abutting property owners in the same
manner as sidewalks on public streets.
D. Nonresidential blocks. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may
vary from the elements of design contained in this section if the nature
of the use requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers may be required, along with safe and

loading may also be required with similar access. Space for the
extension of streets, railroad access rights-of-way, and utilities shall be
provided. The amount of parking space shall be as required by the
Zoning Ordinance.145
A. Subdivisions or land developments with existing structures on land. No
subdivision of land will be approved with the property line extending
through any portion of any existing structure.
(1) If structure(s) is to remain.
(a) In residential zoning districts of the Township, the lot size and
the lot dimensions of the newly created lot containing the
structure(s) must be in scale with the height and bulk of the
existing structure, even if this requires a lot area and/or
dimensions exceeding the minimum zoning requirement for
that district. Structures proposed on the vacant portions of
lands being subdivided shall conform, to the extent possible, to
the height, bulk, building material and architectural character
of the existing structures in the immediate vicinity, and the
subdivision plan shall show building plans in suitable detail.
(b) In other zoning districts of the Township (especially
commercial and industrial districts), the subdivision of the land
must provide adequate service and parking facilities, etc., in
keeping with the minimum requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance for each lot and cumulatively for all lots in the
145. Editor's Note: See Ch. 184, Zoning.
§ 155-18 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-19
122:387
subdivision. No subdivision will be approved in such instances
if the servicing and/or parking facilities, etc., appurtenant to
the existing structure are deemed inadequate or would be
considered to become inadequate with the development of
the now-vacant lands. Any new structures contemplated on
the newly subdivided parcels shall be in conformity with the
existing structures in the immediate vicinity, to the extent
possible, in regard to height, bulk, building material and
architectural character, and the subdivision plans shall show
building plans in suitable detail.
(c) Alterations and replacements will be permitted within the
existing structure, but exterior extensions of the building must
conform to the requirements of the Limerick Township Zoning
Ordinance, as amended.
(d) Conversions. In cases where the principal building use has not
been as a dwelling, its conversion to a dwelling shall comply
with all of the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and the
Building Code of Limerick Township.146
(2) If existing structure(s) is to be removed. Subdivision approval will
be issued, conditional to the expeditious removal of existing
structures in complete conformity to all other pertinent Township
procedural requirements. The subdivision plans shall furthermore
show in detail the proposed development of each parcel of ground,
and the proposed development shall not provide fewer service and
parking facilities, etc., than now exist. In commercial and industrial
areas, plots of land that have been cleared, as well as the existing
vacant portions of such lands, should be developed in conformity
with the long-range needs of the area to the extent possible, and all
developmental requirements embodied in this chapter and the
Zoning Ordinance shall be adhered to. If roadway realignments and
other similar requirements are deemed necessary in the immediate
vicinity of the plot being subdivided, they shall be corrected as part
of the subdivision design to the utmost of the subdivider's ability.
(3) If existing structure(s) is to be partly replaced or is to be added to.
Demolition plans and/or construction plans must be detailed as
part of the subdivision plan review, and subsequent subdivision
approval will be conditional upon compliance with said proposed
details. Additions to existing structures shall be in harmony with
existing structures in the immediate vicinity, especially in respect
to height, bulk, building materials and architectural
characteristics. In the case of partial demolition of an existing
structure, the remaining structure must be in keeping with the
existing buildings in the immediate vicinity in relation to type, bulk,
building material and architectural characteristics. Renovation
146. Editor's Note: See Ch. 184, Zoning, and Ch. 60, Building Construction.
§ 155-19 LIMERICK CODE § 155-19
122:388
work on the remaining portion of a structure following partial
demolition must be completed promptly and expeditiously.
B. Lot grading for subdivisions and land developments.
(1) Blocks and lots. Blocks and lots shall be graded to secure proper
drainage away from buildings and to prevent the collection of
stormwater in pools. Two-percent-minimum slopes away from
structures shall be required.
(2) Design. All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to carry
surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain or
natural watercourse. Where drainage swales are used to deliver
surface waters away from buildings, they shall not be less than 1%
nor more than 4%. The swales shall be sodded or planted as
required and shall be of such shape and size as to conform with
specifications of the Township Engineer.
(3) Concentration. The concentration of storm drainage in a swale
along the rear or side lot lines is encouraged.
(4) Construction. The subdivider shall construct and/or install such
drainage structures and/or pipes which are necessary to prevent
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off such surface waters
to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse.
(5) Excavation.147 No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper
in slope than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical (66.6%) except under
one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of 1 1/2
horizontal to one vertical and passing through any portion of
the cut face will be entirely inside of the property lines of the
property on which the excavation is made.
(b) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope of steeper than 1 1/2 horizontal to one
vertical, and a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer
and approved by him. The statement shall state that the site
has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope
specified hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or
damage to property.
(c) A concrete or stone masonry wall, constructed according to
present or future designs of the Township of Limerick, is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
147. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 147, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.
§ 155-19 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-19
122:389
(6) Fill. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical except under
one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or create a hazard to adjoining
property, streets, alleys or buildings.
(b) A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage is
submitted to and approved by the Township Engineer.
(c) A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to
present or future designs of the Township of Limerick is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(7) Slopes and fences. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a
minimum of three feet from abutting property or right-of-way lines
of streets or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the
edge without encroaching on the abutting property.
(8) Cleanup. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances
whatsoever.
(9) Multifamily or nonresidential areas. Roof drainage shall be
conveyed by downspouts and other drainage facilities to a
stormwater detention and control structure to minimize the effects
of increased runoff.
(10) Site grading plan. The Township Engineer may require a grading
plan in conjunction with the plan of a subdivision or land
development in order to ensure compliance with the above
standards.
C. Lot siting, planting and beautification for subdivisions and land
developments. In order to promote the highest environmental quality
possible, the success to which the applicant of a subdivision or land
development plan has preserved existing salient natural features and
land forms intrinsic to the site shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a
plat may depend upon the manner in which the layout or design of the
plan has preserved existing natural features.
(1) Limit of contract. Where the applicant is offering for dedication or
is required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
to preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a limit of
contract, which will restrict excavation, earthmoving procedures
and other alterations of the landscape, may be required to ensure
preservation and prevent despoliation of the character of the area
or open space.

(2) Preservation of existing vegetation. Each mature tree, tree mass or
woodland on the site shall be designated "to remain" or "to be
removed," depending on the following criteria: [Amended
5-7-1991 by Ord. No. 130]
(a) All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such
a manner as to preserve the healthy trees and shrubs on the
site. Special consideration shall be given to major specimen
trees.
(b) A mature tree, tree mass or woodland shall be considered "to
remain" only if it meets all of the following criteria:
[1] The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least five feet
from any proposed buildings, structures, paving, parking
or utilities (overhead or underground).
[2] The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least five feet
from any proposed changes in grade or drainage, such as
excavations, mounding or impoundments.
[3] The tree(s) are clear of any proposed sight triangles and
do not, by their location or apparent health, pose any
undue threat to the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
(c) Mature trees, tree masses or woodlands which do not fit the
above criteria shall be designated "to be removed."
(d) It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that vegetation
loss is minimized by showing that no alternative layouts are
possible and that no alternative clearing or grading plan would
reduce the loss of mature trees, tree masses and woodlands.
(3) Topsoil preservation. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or
used as spoil. Topsoil must be removed from the areas of
construction and stored separately. Upon a completion of the
construction, the topsoil must be uniformly redistributed on the
site. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on the slopes of less than 7% and shall be stabilized by sodding on
slope of 7% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes of 20%,
provided that riprap shall be utilized for banks exceeding 25%.
(4) Protection of existing vegetation. Existing vegetation intended to
remain as part of the landscaping of a subdivision or land
development shall be identified in the field prior to any clearing and
physically protected throughout the construction process. A
temporary physical barrier, such as a snow fence, shall be erected a
minimum of one foot outside the drip line on all sides of individual
trees, tree masses or woodlands prior to major clearing or
construction. The barrier shall be placed to prevent disturbance to
or compaction of soil inside the barrier and shall remain until

§ 155-19.1. Flag lots. [Added 7-17-1990 by Ord. No. 117]
Flag lots, as defined herein, may be permitted by the Board of Supervisors
in the R-1 and R-2 Districts, in accordance with the following standards and
criteria:
construction is complete. The barrier shall be shown on the
landscape plan. [Amended 5-7-1991 by Ord. No. 130148]
A. Purpose of flag lotting.
(1) To preserve farmland, woodland, scenic views, historic sites or
other environmental amenities by locating building lots away from
existing roads.
(2) To permit the reasonable subdivision of land which is physically
constrained by its irregular shape or limited road frontage.
(3) To provide an alternative to the construction of new streets, where
the number of lots and the volume of traffic generated are
insufficient to warrant a new street.
(4) To provide for future road construction at suitable locations, where
future subdivision of interior lots or tracts is possible.
B. Design standards.
(1) In a subdivision of five or more lots, flag lots may comprise no more
than 15% of the total number of lots, rounded to the nearest whole
number.
(2) A flag lot shall be connected to a public street by an access strip
held in fee simple ownership as part of the flag lot.
(3) The access strip shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide for its entire
length, shall not exceed a vertical grade of 10% and should contain
no horizontal turn greater than 45°, where practical.
(4) The body of the flag lot shall comply with all the minimum
dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located. The area of the access strip shall not be counted toward
the minimum lot area requirement.
(5) Flag lots shall not be used as a means of avoiding the construction
of public roads where warranted.
(6) No more than one tier of flag lots shall be permitted on a tract; in
other words, a flag lot may not be located behind another flag lot.

industrial developments, shall set aside land suitable for park, recreation
and open space purposes as a condition precedent to final plan approval,
according to the objectives of the Limerick Township Comprehensive Park,
Recreation and Open Space Plan and the following requirements:
(7) Flag lots shall not be permitted to access the turnaround portion of
a cul-de-sac.
(8) Where the body of the flag lot is capable of being further
subdivided, the access strip shall be a minimum of 50 feet wide and
suitably located for future use as a road, unless further subdivision
of the tract is prohibited by deed restriction or other legal
instrument. The applicant shall submit a tentative sketch plan for
the entire tract, showing how the use of flag lots is a logical first
step in the subdivision of the tract.
(9) The length of the access strip shall be kept to a minimum.
(a) As a guide, the preferred length is approximately equal to the
depth of one lot which complies with the area requirements of
the zoning district where it is located.
(b) No access strip should exceed a length of three times the lot
depth described in Subsection B(9)(a) above, unless the
additional length is necessary to preserve farmland or other
environmental amenities.
(10) The access strip shall intersect the public street at a safe, visible
location.
(11)No more than two access strips may abut each other. Each pair of
abutting access strips must share a common access point and
driveway from the edge of the pavement to a distance of 50 feet
beyond the ultimate right-of-way line of the road.
(12) An access point for a flag lot should be located at least 100 feet
from an access point to a street frontage lot, unless traffic safety
considerations, topography or sensitive environmental features
require another location.
(13) Access points to flag lots, whether single or paired, shall be
separated by at least 300 feet, measured along the right-of-way of
the public road.

(2) Identified floodplain areas. Where an identified floodplain area is
located on a site, there shall be provided an easement conforming
substantially to the lines of such floodplain and of such width as will
be adequate to preserve the identified floodplain area. [Amended
3-15-2016 by Ord. No. 365]
(3) Dedication. Where stormwater or surface water will be gathered
within the subdivision or land development and discharged or
drained in volume over lands within or beyond he boundaries of the
subdivision or land development, the subdivider, developer or
builder shall reserve or obtain easements over all lands affected.
The easements shall be adequate for such discharge of drainage
and for carrying off such water and for the maintenance, repair and
reconstruction of the same, including the right of passage over by
vehicles, machinery and other equipment for such purposes, and
shall be of sufficient width for such passage and work. The
subdivider, developer or builder shall convey, at no cost, the
easements to the Township upon demand.
A. Bench marks. The Township elevations are based on the Township
sanitary sewer system datum and/or United States Geodetic Survey
Map. Location and elevation is available to all engineers and surveyors
upon application to the Township Engineer's office. All contours and
elevations shown on plans must be based on this system.
B. Staking requirements. All lots shall be staked by the registered
engineer or surveyor for the subdivider when final grading has been
completed. This stakeout shall be visible and shall be completed before
an owner or occupant moves into the property. All lot corner markers
shall be permanently located and shall be metal pins at least 5/8 inch in
diameter and at least 24 inches in length, located in the ground to the
existing grade. Corner markers shall be set to a horizontal control of

bridges and culverts, shall be installed and the land graded for adequate
drainage as shown on the improvement construction plan and approved
with the preliminary plan.
person, shall be not less than four inches square on top and 24 inches
in depth and shall be set in the ground at the existing grade.
A. When required. Storm drains and appurtenances shall be constructed
by the subdivider to take surface water from the bottom of vertical
grades, the grades of which slope on both sides toward the bottom. To
lead water away from springs and to avoid excessive use of cross
gutters at street intersections and elsewhere, all surface waters shall
be enclosed in a storm drain. Open watercourses will be permitted
where they exist naturally and where, in the opinion of the department
or agencies affected, they will not interfere with public convenience or
safety but in fact will provide comparable or superior drainage
capabilities to piped drainage. When submitting for approval a plan
involving the construction of storm drains, the designer's computations
shall be submitted in duplicate to facilitate the checking of the design.
The following tables and charts shall be used for all computations:
Rational Formula for Amount of Runoff
Q = C x i x A
In which:
Q = The runoff from the district in cubic feet per second.
C = The runoff coefficient.
i = The average intensity of rainfall, in inches per hour, for a period
of maximum rainfall of a given frequency of occurrence and having a
duration equal to the time required for runoff from the farthest point
in the drainage area to the point considered in the design.
A = The drainage area of the district in acres.

B. Location. Wherever practicable, storm drains shall be located behind
the curb and within the right-of-way of the street. They shall be
protected by a cover of at least 18 inches when necessary, as
determined by the Township Engineer or his designee.
C. Size and grade. Storm drains shall be adequate for the anticipated
runoff when the area is fully developed as permitted by zoning. They
shall have a minimum internal diameter of 12 inches and a minimum
grade of 1/2 of 1% unless otherwise approved by the Township
Engineer. The rainfall frequency shall be 25 years.
D. Change in direction. Special curved storm drain sections may be used
where abrupt changes are made in alignment in lieu of constructing
manholes if the circumstances so warrant.
E. Manholes. Manholes shall be constructed at all changes in horizontal or
vertical alignment and shall be spaced not more than 300 feet apart on
pipe of 24 inches internal diameter or less and not more than 500 feet
apart where pipes of greater size are installed. Inlets may be
substituted for manholes where they will serve a useful purpose.
F. Inlets. Inlet spacing shall be so arranged that 95% of the gutter flow will
be captured. No inlet smaller than the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation's Type 4 Foot Special inlet shall be used on streets with
grades of 4% or less. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's
Type 6 foot special inlets shall be used on streets with grades of more
than 4%. Inlets at street intersections shall be placed on the tangent
and not on the curved portions. The gutter adjacent to and immediately
upgrade from the inlet shall be so warped as to direct the water into the
inlet.

§ 155-24. Bridges and culverts.
G. Castings. Manhole and inlet castings, together with their covers or
gratings, shall conform to such Township standards as may be in effect
at the time the design of the sewer is submitted.
H. Stormwater roof drains. Stormwater roof drains and pipes shall not
discharge water over a sidewalk but shall extend under the sidewalk to
the gutter. Where storm drains are accessible, the roof drain shall be
connected thereto.
I. Unnatural drainage. Wherever construction stops or concentrates the
natural flow of storm drainage in such a way as to affect adjoining
properties, approval of the owners shall be obtained in writing and a
copy filed with the Township Secretary. Approval of plans by the
Township does not authorize or sanction drainage affecting adjoining
properties.
J. Design submission.
(1) All plans showing the proposed storm sewer construction must be
accompanied by a complete design submitted by the registered
engineer or surveyor.
(2) When subdivisions or land developments are submitted to the
Township for approval in sections, a complete storm sewer design
for the proposed subdivision and land development shall be
submitted. The proposed design must include the entire tract and
not just a portion of it.
(3) If construction is contemplated for only a section of a subdivision or
land development, the engineer shall show how he proposes to
handle stormwater from this section in order to prevent damage to
adjacent properties. If temporary construction is required, the
engineer shall include the designs for such structures in the plan
submitted.
(4) In the event that such temporary measures cannot ensure
protection to adjacent properties, then the main outfall line of the
storm sewer shall be included as part of the construction for the
proposed section.
A. Bridges and culverts shall be designed to meet the current
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards to support
expected loads and to carry expected traffic flows. They shall be
constructed to the full width of the right-of-way.
B. Approval of the Water and Power Resources Board of the
commonwealth or its successor is required when the area drained
upstream of the point under consideration exceeds an area of 1/2
square mile.

§ 155-25. Sewers and sewage disposal.149
A. Sewers. Wherever practicable, sanitary sewers shall be installed and
connected to the Township sanitary sewer system. In areas not
presently served by public sanitary sewers, the Township may require,
according to Act No. 537 passed by the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania (1965),150 in addition to installation of temporary
individual on-site sewage disposal facilities, the installation and
capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections if studies by the
Township Supervisors indicate that extension of public sanitary sewer
trunks or laterals to serve the property subdivided appears probable or
necessary to protect the public health.
(1) When a feasibility analysis, conducted by the Township Engineer,
Local Enforcer and District Sanitarian, has ascertained that
sanitary sewers are practicable, then sanitary sewers, with
connection to each building in a subdivision or land development,
shall be installed at the expense of the applicant or subdivider and
connected to the Township sanitary sewer system.
(2) If outfall sewers are not available in the vicinity but are considered
reasonably necessary in the near future by the Township or the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for the area
in question, a system of sewers, together with all necessary laterals
extending from mains to the street right-of-way line, shall be
installed at the expense of the subdivider or applicant. The sewer
lines shall be suitably capped at the limits of the subdivision or land
development, and the laterals shall be capped at the right-of-way
line. The sewer installation shall include the construction within
rights-of-way or easements to bring the sewer to the future
connection with the Township sanitary sewer system.
(3) If sanitary sewers are not to be installed at the time of subdivision
and development, subdividers shall grant, reserve and set aside
easements in the streets and roads for the installation and
maintenance of sewer lines at such time that the subdivision or
land development shall be a part of the Township sanitary sewer
system.
(4) A sewer shall be considered to be planned for extension to a given
area any time after preliminary engineering and related studies
have been completed and the construction of facilities adequate to
serve the area containing the subdivision has been programmed for
completion within a reasonable time.
(5) When capped sewers are provided, on-site disposal facilities shall
also be provided.

§ 155-25 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-25
122:401
(6) The size, grade, location of manholes and other details of sanitary
sewers shall meet Township Authority specifications.
(7) Laterals. Lateral connections to each lot shown on the final plan
shall be installed to the right-of-way line of the street prior to
paving. Each building shall have a separate connection to the
Township sanitary sewer system.
(8) Work shall be completed in conformance with the current edition of
the Standard Specifications of Limerick Township Municipal
Authority.151
(9) This section shall be applicable to all subdivisions and land
developments, whether utilizing public or private streets, and, in
the case of a subdivision or land development utilizing private
streets, the subdivider or the applicant shall execute a recordable
covenant with the Township and/or Township Authority that, for the
purposes of sewer connections, assessments and rentals, his rights
and liabilities and those of his grantees, heirs, successors and
assigns shall be the same as if his property abutted a public street.
B. On-lot disposal systems. If public sewage disposal is not available and
the sewage treatment is on a project or individual-lot basis, such private
facilities must be installed by the subdivider, developer or builder under
the direct supervision of the local sewage enforcement officer ("local
officer").
(1) Necessary tests and inspection. Such officer shall require
percolation tests and other data from the developer to determine
the size and extent of facilities needed. During installation of such
facilities and before final coverage, the local officer shall make
inspections and checks to assure that all requirements and
specifications have been met. He shall be granted free access to the
development area at all times during this period.
(2) Certificate of approval. After assuring that all requirements and
specifications have been met, the appropriate local officer will then
issue review comments regarding sewage disposal to the Secretary
of the Township as a prerequisite to final plan approval.
(a) The type of on-site sewage disposal system to be installed shall
be determined on the basis of location, topography, available
area, soil characteristics, permeability and groundwater
elevation. The disposal area to be provided shall be determined
by the results of percolation tests, soil classification, depth of
the water table and such other tests as may be deemed
necessary. Proof of the adequacy of such facilities shall be
furnished by the registered professional engineer or other
person whose qualifications are deemed satisfactory by the
Township Supervisors. The reports of such tests shall be

required at each disposal area. one percolation tests per lot
shall be required when the subdivider is dividing ground into
lots and is not building immediately.
(b) All percolation tests shall conform to the standards of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(c) The usable area for sewage disposal shall be shown on the
preliminary plan for each lot. The usable area shall be situated
beyond the radius of the water supply well and shall conform to
all rules and regulations or future amendments thereto of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the
Township of Limerick.
(d) Proximity to wells. In no instance shall a septic tank, tile field
or other effluent disseminating system be located uphill from a
drilled well and shall not be closer to it than those distances
specified by the Sewage Facilities Act.152
A. Underground utilities. All gas and water mains shall be installed
underground. All electric, telephone and communication services, both
main and service lines, shall be provided by underground cables
installed in accordance with the prevailing standards and practices of
the utility or other companies providing such services, except where it
is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township Supervisors that
underground installations herein required are not feasible because of
physical conditions of the land involved. All main underground cables
which are within the right-of-way of a street shall be located as
specified by the Township Supervisors or their designated agent.
B. In order to promote and facilitate the placement underground of utility
distribution lines, a letter of endorsement shall be required from the
suppliers of utility service (including but not limited to electrical,
telephone or cable television) of the developer's choice, wherein the
applicant acknowledges that underground utilities are feasible and
shall be consummated as part of the improvement plan. A statement
relative to the intent of the developer to provide underground utility
service shall be placed and marked on the final plan requisite to final
approval of such plan.
C. The provisions in this chapter shall not be construed as to limit or
interfere with the construction, installation, operation and maintenance

(3) Provide for safe convenient, direct pedestrian access to buildings
and to and from public sidewalks, bus stops, crosswalks,
pedestrian/bicycle paths and between various buildings in the
district.
(4) Promote the use of alternative modes of transportation such as
bicycle and pedestrian paths and bus transit and provide and
maintain high-quality bus stop waiting areas.
(5) Provide a pedestrian-friendly character and atmosphere
throughout the district with public gardens, courtyards, plazas,
pedestrian/bicycle paths, street trees, seating areas, coordinated
street furnishings, ornamental lighting and pedestrianscale
signage and wayfinding.
B. Applicability.
(1) The building and streetscape design standards shall apply to any
land development application for all lots located along Ridge Pike
except for lots located in the VC Village Commercial District. The
building and streetscape design standards shall also apply to any
lot located in the MS Main Street Zoning District.
(2) Chain architecture. If a proposed use has standard architectural
styles, materials and motifs, the proposed architecture shall be
subject to the architectural design standards.
C. Compliance.
(1) A design manual shall be submitted to demonstrate how the
development will comply with the design standards in conjunction
with any land development. The design manual shall include the
following items:
(a) Site plan, drawn to scale, showing the plan elements as
contained within this section;
(b) Photographs of existing buildings that illustrate the design
intent of the proposal; or building elevations drawn to scale; or
photorealistic illustrations depicting proposed scale,
proportions, design elements, materials and color;
(c) Colored rendering of the plan(s);
(d) Landscape plan;
(e) Current photographs of site.
(2) Once these preliminary styles are reviewed by the Board of
Supervisors, and the Township provides the applicant with verbal
and/or written comments, additional and more detailed
architectural renderings, prepared by a registered architect, shall
be submitted for all proposed buildings, together with a list and
§ 155-27.5 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-27.5
122:417
samples of types of exterior building materials that will be visible
from any public street near or adjacent to the site. Similarly, a
rendered landscape plan, prepared by a registered landscape
architect shall also be submitted for review.
D. Site design standards.
(1) Overall site coordination. Each site shall be designed as a unified
development, with a coordinated site design and landscape plan
with coordinated signage, way finding, lighting, site amenities,
paving and other similar site features that create a high-quality
environment.
(2) Location of parking. Each site shall be designed to minimize the
negative impact and appearance of the parking lots. The amount of
parking shall be minimized between the building(s) and the street.
Parking shall be concentrated to the side and rear of the building(s)
and behind the front yard setback line whenever possible.
(3) Vehicle access. In order to facilitate efficient internal traffic
circulation and minimize road traffic for short trips, all parking
areas shall connect directly to parking areas on adjacent lots. If a
connection is not possible at the time of land development, site
design provisions shall be made for a future connection to adjacent
properties. Permanent cross-access easements between properties
should be enacted whenever possible. Shared or common
driveways shall be designed whenever feasible.
(a) If a lot is developed or redeveloped, any new vehicular access
point shall be located along a side lot line in order to create a
shared driveway with the adjacent lot, whenever feasible.
(4) Pedestrian circulation. A safe and direct pedestrian access shall be
provided from all sidewalks to the building entrances and exits.
E. Buildings and streetscape design standards. Treatment between any
building and the street edge shall utilize the following design
standards:
(1) Building orientation and access: Buildings shall be designed with
windows, public access points and signage facing streets,
sidewalks and pedestrian ways.
(2) Building orientation and access: Grade-level exterior doors that
swing onto a public walkway that is less than six feet wide shall be
set into the building to avoid conflicts with pedestrians. Doors
swinging out that project into a public walkway shall include a
barrier to prohibit doors from swinging into pedestrians.
F. Primary building entrance.
(1) A primary pedestrian building entrance shall be located on one or
more primary front facades facing the street and pedestrian way,
§ 155-27.5 LIMERICK CODE § 155-27.5
122:418
rather than the rear or sides of the building, and shall be well
articulated and visible from the street as described herein.
Secondary access points may be located along other facades.
(a) In multiuse buildings, each building use and street floor tenant
space shall have at least one functional entrance directly
visible and accessible from the street. Where tenant entrances
are via common lobbies, lobby entrances shall create
architectural emphasis through design features such as
changes in plane, step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies,
towers, bays, or similar features.
(2) If the primarily building entrance is not located along the primary
front facade then the applicant must demonstrate that the primary
building entrance may not feasibly be located along the primary
front facade, and the primary building entrance shall be located to
the side of the building in accordance with the following:
(a) Buildings with the primary building entrance on the side shall
be visually emphasized to make the entry visible from adjacent
and nearby public roadways. Architectural emphasis shall be
achieved through design features such as changes in plane,
step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies, towers, building
entries, bays, or similar features.
(b) Buildings with the main entry on the side shall be accessible by
a public walkway connecting the sidewalk along the site's
street frontage to the parking areas.
G. Building architectural design standards. The architectural design
standards are incorporated into the MS Main Street District to ensure
that the size, proportions and design of new or substantially improved
buildings create a pedestrian-friendly environment, that is highly
articulated as described herein. The visual mass of all buildings shall be
deemphasized through the use of architectural elements including
form, architectural features and materials, in order to reduce their
apparent bulk and volume, to enhance visual quality and contribute to
human scale development in accordance with the following:
(1) All structures proposed under the same application or development
application shall consist of a unified and coordinated architectural
theme.
(2) Exterior building materials. The predominant material of all
facades facing public streets shall be brick, stone native to the
region, highly textured masonry block, curtain wall, metal panel
systems with concealed fasteners, glazed panels, cement-board
siding or wood. Stucco or dryvit may be utilized, provided that it is
no more than 20% of non-window facades at the street floor level
and no more than 50% of the non-window facades above the street
floor level.
§ 155-27.5 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-27.5
122:419
(a) All sides of a building shall be architecturally designed to be
consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details.
The architectural treatment of the front facade shall be
continuous in its major features around all visibly exposed
sides of a building with the exception of parking structures or
that portion of a building containing a parking structure. Blank
wall or service area treatment of side and/or rear elevations
visible from public view shall be prohibited.
(b) If approved by the Board of Supervisors, simulated brick or
simulated stone may be used as the predominant material of all
facades facing public streets.
(3) Vertical articulation. Buildings are required to provide articulation
on the exterior of any wall surface in order to provide architectural
interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the
effect of a single, long monotonous wall or roof. Blank facades,
without windows or architectural elements to create interest, are
prohibited.
(a) The massing of any one building wall shall not exceed 50 feet
(horizontal dimension) without a vertical articulation along its
entire height. Vertical articulation may include a vertical
change of facade plane or material. The depth of change in
facade plane for vertical wall articulations shall be a minimum
of two feet for every 50 feet of building facade length. Such
articulation may consist of building wall offsets, recesses and
projections such as bays, balconies, canopies, awnings,
pilasters, columns and other similar features.
(b) Building corners located at the intersections of public streets
shall incorporate the following:
[1] Building corners shall be chamfered at least 10 feet from
the corner setback or a minimum of five feet from both
street frontages. The chamfer shall extend from the
ground to the top of the building. If the chamfers cannot
extend above the ground floor to the top of the building,
then the portion of building corners above the street level
story shall be visually emphasized through design
features, such as step backs, fenestration patterns,
balconies, towers, bays or similar features.
(4) Horizontal articulation. Horizontal articulation of the building
facade, including changes to the horizontal building plane and/or
materials, shall be used to break up the scale of the building
facade. Such horizontal articulation may be provided by roof
terraces, setbacks or other devices. Horizontal articulation shall
emphasize the building base, body and roof/parapet edge.
(a) Buildings greater than 35 feet in height shall be designed
utilizing a definition of the base, body and roof or parapet edge
§ 155-27.5 LIMERICK CODE § 155-27.5
122:420
as the primary method of defining and relating buildings to one
another.
(b) The base shall generally be considered the first story of the
facade facing a public street, but can vary depending on the
overall building height and range from ground plane to the
floor line of the third floor in buildings of at least four stories in
height. The design of the base should be emphasized through
the design, quality and durability of its materials to create
visual interest. The transition from the base of a building to the
body may be expressed either horizontally, through a shift in
the horizontal plane and/or through a change in building
materials.
(c) The top of a building greater than 35 feet in height shall be
architecturally distinguished by providing a visual termination
to the facade and interest at the skyline by incorporation of a
projecting element such as a cornice, eave or roofline overhang
sufficient in depth to create a shadow line visible from street
level. On buildings taller than four stories in height, the top of
the building could encompass the last floor of a building.
(d) Any building measuring taller than 50 feet in height shall
provide an expression line on the wall plane, continuing around
all sides of a building above the first or second floor. The
expression line may consist of a projecting element, a
minimum four inches in depth, such as a belt course or cornice
as well as a terrace that sets back the walls of the building
above the expression line.
(5) Roofs.
(a) All buildings that are three stories or less in height shall have
pitched roofs and/or roofs that appear to be pitched when
viewed from the public right of way that meets the approval of
the Board of Supervisors.
(b) Rooflines shall be articulated vertically with a change in
roofline every 50 feet.
(c) Flat roofs may be permitted in buildings over three stories and
due to other instances where flat roofs cannot be avoided,
provided that they include appropriate architectural elements
to provide architectural interest. On buildings with flat roofs,
all visibly exposed walls shall have an articulated cornice that
projects a minimum of four inches horizontally form the
vertical building wall. The applicant is required to present
compelling functional and aesthetic reasons to the Board of
Supervisors to demonstrate why a flat roof cannot be avoided.
(d) Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted at street floor level
and on upper levels where appropriate, if they complement a
§ 155-27.5 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-27.5
122:421
building's architectural features. Metal or internally lit
awnings are prohibited. In buildings with multiple storefronts,
or on adjacent buildings, compatible awnings should be used
as a means of unifying the structures.
(e) All rooftop mechanical equipment, including antennas, shall be
visually and acoustically screened from both the public rightof-
way and adjacent properties. Screening may be
accomplished by using parapets, walls or roof elements. Such
screening shall be integral to the architectural design of the
building.
(6) Proportions of walls to openings.
(a) A wall to clear window/door ratio of between two to one and
four to one is required. For street floor-level commercial and
retail uses, a wall to clear window ratio between one to one and
two to one is required.
(b) The maximum length of a blank wall between clear window/
door openings shall be 15 feet.
(c) Elements such as pent eaves, pediments, or sills and lintels
above and below windows and doors are required.
(7) Windows.
(a) Smoked, reflective, tinted or black glass in windows is
discouraged, especially at street level. Glazing shall have a
minimum visible transmittance of 0.75.
(b) Any street-level walls with less than 50% of clear windows shall
be articulated by two or more of the following:
[1] Articulation of facade plane, and/or changes in materials;
[2] If the building is occupied by a commercial use, recessed
or projecting display window cases or simulated windows.
(8) Parking structures. The following shall apply to parking structures
located within 300 feet of Ridge Pike and visible to public view:
(a) The facade shall contain active uses or be designed to screen
vehicles in the parking garage from view of the street.
Screening shall be compatible with the character of the
surrounding buildings and meet architectural design
guidelines of this section.
(b) If architectural screening cannot be provided, a minimum
twenty-five-foot wide Type 2 screen shall be provided in
accordance with § 155-27.1D(6)(b).

B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way as will minimize erosion.
§ 155-31 LIMERICK CODE § 155-31
122:434
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.

drainage measures shall be installed in the development as soon as
is practicable.
(8) Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be structurally retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
C. Grading and drainage. In order to provide more suitable sites for
building and other uses, improve surface drainage and control erosion,
the following requirements shall be met:
(1) All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and to dispose of it without ponding,
and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and
dispose of surface water without ponding, except where approved
by the Township Supervisors.
(2) All drainage facilities shall be of such design as to adequately
control the surface runoff and to carry it to the nearest suitable
outlet, such as a curbed street, storm drain, natural watercourse or
properly designed swale. Where drainage swales are used to divert
surface waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or
planted as required and shall be of such slope, shape and size as
may be required by the Township.
(3) Concentration of surface water runoff shall be permitted only in
properly designed and maintained swales, watercourses or
retention basins.
(4) Excavations and fills.
§ 155-31 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 155-31
122:435
(a) Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than 2:1 unless
stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing, except as approved
by the Township Supervisors because of special conditions.
(b) Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water
from damaging the cut face of excavation on the sloping
surface of fills.
(c) Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
(d) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(e) Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
(f) No increased surface runoff will be permitted to leave the
property being subdivided or developed, by way of natural
watercourses or storm drainage pipes, without first being
suitably restrained in such a way as to maintain runoff volume
as it existed on the site previous to subdivision or development.
(g) Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during
periods of flooding.
(h) Grading will not be done in such a way as to divert water onto
the property of another landowner without the express consent
of the Township Supervisors.
(i) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control will be exercised.
(j) Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provisions will be made for the installation of culverts or
bridges.
D. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the
person, corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to
remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses and to repair any damage at his expense as quickly as
possible.
(2) Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within any
subdivision or land development is the responsibility of the
developer until it is accepted by the Township or some other official
agency, after which it becomes the responsibility of the accepting
agency.

122:436
(3) It is the responsibility of any person, corporation or other entity
doing any act on or across a communal stream, watercourse or
swale or upon the floodplain or right-of-way thereof to maintain, as
nearly as possible, in its present state, the stream, watercourse,
swale, floodplain or right-of-way for the duration of the activity and
to return it to its original condition or the equivalent after such
activity is completed.
(4) Maintenance of drainage facilities or watercourses originating and
terminating on private property is the responsibility of the owner,
up to the point of open discharge at the property line or at a
communal watercourse within the property.

of, alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or thing in
or commit any act which will affect the normal or flood flow in any
communal stream or watercourse without having obtained prior
approval from the Township Engineer or Townships designee,
Floodplain Administrator, or the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, whichever is appropriate. [Amended
3-15-2016 by Ord. No. 365]
(6) (Reserved)170
(7) Each person, corporation or other entity which makes any surface
changes shall be required to:
(a) Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it at the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the
drainage area;
(b) Handle existing and potential off-site runoff through the
development by designing it so as to adequately handle storm
runoff from a fully developed area upstream;
(c) Pay a proportionate share of the total cost of off-site
improvements to the common natural watercourse, based on a

calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment.
§ 160-21. Determination of liability for tax and collection.
Each employer in the Township of Limerick shall use his employment

though the tax had originally been levied against him.

whom such domestic is employed on January 2, 1976, and January 1 for each
calendar year thereafter shall be responsible for the collection and payment
of the annual local services tax for such domestic to the Collector, and, in

for deduction and payment over to the Township of Limerick of the local
services tax shall rest upon the employer of the domestic on the next
succeeding date following January 2, 1976, and January 1 for each calendar
year thereafter, and said employer shall furnish to said domestic employee
a certificate of payment of said local services tax, to be exhibited to all other
employers of said domestic, and the production of said certificate to such
other employers shall excuse them from the deduction of any further local
services tax from said domestic employee for the year.

not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 160-40. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by § 160-38 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation, or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property fine
adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which Limerick Township is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriffs sale or Tax
Claim Bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife, or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.

beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to
successor trustee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where Limerick Township reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(13) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(14) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt or the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:

Except as otherwise provided in § 160-40, documents which make, confirm

processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and

real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.
(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status

purposes, preservation of land for historic, recreational, scenic,

interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation.

(22) leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax statement of
value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $25 and costs.
C. Specification for traffic signal equipment. In an effort to standardize
equipment and to provide compatibility with the existing closed-loop
traffic signal system, the following specifications must be followed for
the installation of new traffic signals or modification of existing traffic
signals in Limerick Township: [Added 7-26-2007 by Ord. No. 280]
(1) Only PEEK M3005E Masters, PEEK 3925E (TS-2, Type 2)
Controller Units and PEEK 8311A Double Diamond Conflict
Monitor Units, as manufactured by Quixote Traffic Corporation,
shall be provided.
(2) When installed in a closed-loop multi-arterial traffic system
(CLMATS), communications between the master controller and the
local controllers will be maintained via a fiber optic (single mode)
infrastructure. External modems shall be utilized at all locations
where communications is to be established and shall interface
through an auxiliary RS232C port on the master and/or local units.
Communications between each master and the central computer
will be established as directed (i.e., direct connect, fiber or dial-up).
Dial-up shall be provided utilizing PEEK LPM-33-E modems. Unless
§ 170-9 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 170-10
168:523
otherwise noted, communications throughout the system shall be
established at 19.2k baud.
(3) A GPS time source shall be provided at each master and at each
isolated (not interconnected via fiber) local to maintain clock
accuracy for time-of-day and coordination purposes. The time
source shall receive signals from the GPS satellite network and
interface to masters and isolated locals through the auxiliary "D"
module. The GPS time source shall provide a momentary closure,
programmable to any hour of the day, to the external clock reset
input of the units. The GPS time source shall automatically adjust
for DST changes.
(4) For intersections that are not to be incorporated into the closedloop
system, the external fiber optic modem shall not be provided,
and a standard NEMA Type 12 Conflict Monitor Unit may be
substituted for the PEEK 8311A Double Diamond Conflict Monitor
Unit.
(5) All controller assemblies shall be equipped with an eight-phase
load bay panel (either 12 or 16 position) capable of providing the
required sequence of operation. The cabinet enclosures shall be a
Dudlik (or equal) base-mounted (Type 1) NEMA 3R enclosures and
sized (55 inches by 44 inches by 26 inches with eighteen-inch riser
base and shelves) to adequately house the full complement of the
above equipment.
(6) Vehicle detection shall be provided through a sixteen-channel
detector rack with power supply capable of accommodating up to
eight two-channel Model 222 or equal rack mount detector cards.
(7) All pedestrian inputs shall be mechanically isolated through a
12VAC interface. As a minimum, two isolation circuits shall be
provided.
(8) Traffic signal supports shall be mastarms.
(9) A minimum of two luminaires per intersection shall be installed on
the mastarms and shall be 250 watt HPS. Wiring for the luminaries
shall be installed in a separate two-inch conduit system specifically
for that purpose and will be protected by circuit breakers that are
also separate from the traffic signal system.
(10) Optical preemption shall be provided for each approach identified
at the intersection. Detectors will be positioned to achieve the
proper distance for activation and control of the intersection.
Optical preemption shall be Opticom as formerly manufactured by
3M Corporation.
(11) Uninterruptible power supply shall be included to provide for
emergency power when the utility power is outside the equipment
operating range as described by NEMA. The UPS shall provide six
§ 170-10 LIMERICK CODE § 170-10
168:524
hours of operation for a computed load of 250 watts at 72° F. (four
hours at 30° F.). A parallel battery configuration shall be utilized
so that a failure of any one battery does not render the system
inoperable. The UPS battery backup unit shall be a signal sense
traffic UPS as manufactured by Sense Products LLC.
(12) All vehicular and pedestrian signal heads shall be LED (lightemitting
diode) as manufactured by GE Lumination (formerly
GELcore) and shall meet all current ITE specifications and
requirements.
(13) All overhead street name signs shall be LED internally illuminated
as manufactured by GE Lumination (formerly GELcore) and shall
be equipped with a photocell.
(14) Conduit runs will be sized for future use. All conduit street crossing
will be a minimum of one-inch to three-inch conduit. Controllers
should be located at the intersection of conduit runs and not at the
end of a conduit loop. Each controller foundation, or pole
foundation if the controller is pole mounted, will have the
equivalent of two-inch to three-inch conduits entering it from an
adjacent junction box. All loops will terminate in junction boxes,
and there will be at least one junction box on each corner.
(15) All equipment shall conform to PennDOT Specifications,
Publication 408, and installation shall conform to PennDot Traffic
Standards-Signals, TC-7800 Series and Standards for Roadway
Construction, RC-Series.
(16) Traffic signal permit plans for new construction or modifications
must be submitted to the Limerick Township Traffic Engineer for
review and approval.
(17) Traffic signal construction plans for new construction or
modifications must be submitted to the Limerick Township Traffic
Engineer for review and approval.
(18) All review letters from the Limerick Township Traffic Engineer
shall be submitted to PennDOT for consideration in its review of the
traffic signal permit plan.
(19) Shop drawings and catalog cuts shall be submitted to the Limerick
Township Traffic Engineer for review and approval prior to
construction.
(20) The Limerick Township Traffic Engineer shall be notified no less
than 30 days prior to the start of traffic signal construction and/or
modifications.
(21) After the review and approval of traffic signal permit and
construction plans, the Limerick Township Traffic Engineer shall
perform inspection duties for the construction of the traffic signal.

Police Department shall file a summary traffic citation at District Court No.
38-01-19 for each and every such violation, and, upon conviction of said

payment of such fine and costs, to undergo imprisonment for not more than
10 days.
A. It shall be the duty of the police officers of the Township, acting in
accordance with the instructions of the Chief of Police, to report:
(1) That the vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of this
article;
(2) The date and hour of such violation;

§ 170-28. Authority; scope.
This article is enacted under authority of Section 6109(a)(22) of the Vehicle
Code202 and gives authority to the Township to remove and impound:
§ 170-29. Authority to remove and impound.
The Township shall have the authority to remove and impound or to order
the removal and impounding of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise
illegally, provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the
conditions stated in § 170-28 of this article, provided that no such vehicle
shall be removed or impounded except in strict adherence to the provisions
of this article.
§ 170-30. Designation of approved storage garages; bonding;
towing and storage.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only
by approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time by
the Board of Supervisors. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the
Board of Supervisors that it is bonded or has acquired liability insurance
in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors as sufficient to
indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those
vehicles while in the custody of the garage keeper for the purpose of
towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to the Board
of Supervisors its schedule of charges for towing and storage of vehicles
under this article, and, when the schedule is approved by the Board of
Supervisors, those charges shall be adhered to by the approved storage
garage; no different schedule of charges shall be adopted without approval
of the Board of Supervisors, and no different charges shall be demanded of
or collected from any person whose vehicle is removed or impounded under
this article by any approved storage garage. The Board of Supervisors shall
delete from its list of approved storage garages any garage that makes any
unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle removed or impounded
under this article.
§ 170-31. Notification of removal and impounding.
Within 12 hours from the time of removal of any vehicle under authority
granted by this article, notice of the fact that the vehicle was removed shall

violation of any provisions of this chapter; and
B. Vehicles parked in metered and unmetered parking lots in the Township
in violation of any provisions of this chapter.

be sent by the Township to the owner of record of the vehicle. The notice
shall designate the place from which the vehicle was removed, the reason
for its removal and impounding and the garage in which it was impounded.
§ 170-32. Effect of payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a Magisterial District Judge.
Payment of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver
of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the
provision of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 170-33. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The Township shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded
under this article and shall be able at all reasonable times to furnish the
owners or the agents of the owners of those vehicles with information as to
the places of storage of the vehicles.
§ 170-34. Restrictions upon removal of vehicles.
No vehicle shall be removed under the authority of this article if, at the
time of the intended removal, the owner or the person for the time being in
charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and intention

Zoning Ordinance of 1961, as amended by Comprehensive Amendment
enacted September 29, 1992," and shall become effective upon enactment.
§ 184-2. Legislative intent.
This chapter is enacted for the purpose of promoting the health, safety,
morals and the general welfare of the Township. The chapter is in
accordance with a Comprehensive Plan and is designed to lessen congestion
on the roads and highways, to secure safety from fire, panic and other
danger, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of
land, to avoid undue congestion of population, to facilitate the adequate
provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other
public requirements, to conserve the value of buildings and to encourage
the most appropriate use of land throughout the Township.
§ 184-3. Community development objectives. [Amended 6-2-1998 by
Ord. No. 196]
This chapter is enacted in conformance with the requirements of the
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.205 The goals and
objectives of the Growth Management and Comprehensive Plan of 1995,
as may be amended, are hereby included by reference. In addition, the
following specific objectives are intended to guide the Township's future
development:
A. Residential development objectives.
(1) To encourage the maintenance of the rural character of the
Township while providing for a variety of housing types and
densities for persons of varying incomes, ages and lifestyles.
(2) To establish growth areas within the Township within which higher
density development will be concentrated and centralized sewer
and water service provided.
(3) To provide for low-density residential development in areas outside
the Township's growth area which neither have nor are planned to
have centralized sewer and water service.
(4) To provide for the timing of growth at a rate consistent with the
availability of community facilities and municipal services.
(5) To encourage the retention of agricultural uses and the
preservation and reuse of historic buildings and structures.
205. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 184-1 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-3
168:579
(6) To encourage development of the Township's villages, Limerick and
Linfield, as focal points for the neighborhoods around them, and to
encourage further village residential development at a pedestrian
scale.
(7) To encourage clustering and other flexible lotting techniques to
preserve open space and minimize disturbance of sensitive natural
features.
B. Office and industrial development objectives.
(1) To provide sufficient developable land for all types of industrial
development, in proximity to major regional roads and highway
interchanges.
(2) To concentrate office and limited industrial development around
highway interchanges, to facilitate circulation and minimize
interference with local traffic.
(3) To minimize conflict between industrial development and
surrounding land uses by means of performance standards
governing odors, emissions and other potential side effects of
industrial development.
(4) To ensure the protection of sensitive natural resources by limiting
building coverage and impervious coverage within all
nonresidential development.
C. Commercial development objectives.
(1) To make provisions for adequate commercial facilities to serve the
present and projected population of Limerick Township, rather
than a regional market.
(2) To encourage small-scale, pedestrian-oriented commercial
development within the villages, especially where it leads to the
reuse of existing historic buildings.
(3) To ensure that highway-oriented commercial development is
designed to maximize traffic safety and convenience, and avoid the
cluttered appearance and traffic hazards of traditional "strip"
development.
(4) To encourage development of planned commercial centers,
combining retail and office uses with strong design and circulation
controls at the intersections of major roads.
D. Institutional objectives.
(1) To encourage development of institutional uses needed and desired
by the Township.
§ 184-3 LIMERICK CODE § 184-3
168:580
§ 184-4. Establishment of districts.
(2) To provide guidance and standards for locating and developing
institutional uses within residential and commercial areas, in a
manner compatible with surrounding land uses.
E. Environmental and open space objectives.
(1) To provide standards to control the density and intensity of
development in areas of sensitive natural resources, such as stream
valleys, steep slopes, woodlands and groundwater recharge areas.
(2) To encourage the setting aside of suitable open space within
residential developments, to meet the needs of present and future
residents for active and passive recreational facilities.
(3) To provide for a comprehensive trail system within the Township, to
provide for nonmotorized recreation and to link neighborhoods
with recreational and community facilities.
A. For the purpose of this chapter, the Township is hereby divided into the
following districts, which are designated as follows: [Amended

§ 184-42 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-44
168:633
hardship upon the applicant. The Board may require preliminary
application to the Zoning Officer.
(1) The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made, where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this zoning chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this zoning chapter and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this zoning chapter.
B. Special exceptions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide
requests for special exceptions in accordance with the standards and
criteria found in the particular section of this zoning chapter that
permits application for said special exception, and with the general
standards in § 184-43. In granting any special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this zoning chapter.
C. Persons with disabilities. After the Zoning Officer has received a
complete written application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a
special exception allowing more than five unrelated persons to inhabit a
group home or other modifications to specific requirements of this
chapter if the applicant proves both of the following to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Hearing Board: [Added 6-2-1998 by Ord. No. 196]
§ 184-44 LIMERICK CODE § 184-44
168:634
§ 184-45. Review of challenges and appeals.

Housing Act and/or related applicable state law, as amended.
(2) The facility will serve persons who the applicant proves have
handicaps or disabilities, as defined in and protected by such laws.
A. Time limitations on appeals.
(1) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
(2) Appeals designed to secure reversal or limit the approval of any
application for development, preliminary or final, shall be filed with
the Board no later than 30 days after the application is approved by
an appropriate municipal officer or agency, unless the person filing
proves that he had not notice, knowledge or reason to believe that
such approval had been given. If such person succeeded to his
interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of
his predecessor in interest.
B. Effect of filing. When an appeal is filed, further development or official
action pursuant to the appealed determination or approval shall be
stayed until issuance of a final decision or findings by the Board. If the
Zoning Officer or other municipal agency presents facts to the Board
indicating that such a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, development or official action can only be stayed by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
C. Substantive validity challenge. A landowner who desires to challenge,
on substantive grounds, the validity of a map or ordinance provision
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit the challenge either to the Zoning Hearing
Board or, with a request for curative amendment, to the Township
Board of Supervisors.
(1) The written application to the Zoning Hearing Board shall contain
the reasons for the challenge.
(2) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question and shall specify the place and
time where a copy of the request and its accompanying materials
may be examined by the public.
(3) Based upon the testimony at the hearing(s), the Board shall
determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective,
as alleged. If the challenge is found to have merit, the decision of
§ 184-44 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-45

5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 249; 6-16-2015 by Ord. No. 360]
Unless otherwise specified by the Limerick Township Board of Supervisors,
a special exception or variance shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain
all permits within one year of the date of authorization thereof, except as
modified below:
the Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.
(4) In reaching its decision, the Board shall consider the plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources
and other natural features, the degree to which these are
protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts.
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(5) If the Board fails to act on the request within 45 days of the last
hearing, a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred.
A. Zoning relief that requires the issuance of a building permit may be
extended up to an additional 12 months if the Zoning Officer
determines the applicant has shown good cause in writing.
B. In the event a subdivision or land development plan is required
following the granting of a special exception or variance, the variances
or special exceptions shall not expire so long as the plan is actively
under consideration by the Township, in which case the time limit shall
apply from the date of unappealable final plan approval by the Board of
Supervisors.

based upon the applicant proving that the new use will not be more
intense than the previous use, and the measure of intensity shall take
into consideration the following: [Amended 6-2-1998 by Ord. No.
196; 12-20-2011 by Ord. No. 327]
(1) Traffic volume, ingress and egress and internal circulation
movements;
(2) Noise and the use of hazardous substances;
(3) There shall be no additional outdoor storage;
(4) The new nonconforming use must be compatible with the character
of the surrounding area;
(5) The appearance from the street must remain identical to the
previous nonconforming use;

industrial use and the change in nonconforming use must be
commercial if the previous use was commercial or industrial if the
previous use was industrial, but in either event, a residential
nonconforming use shall not be eligible for a special exception. A
special exception cannot be granted if a commercial use is being
converted to industrial or vice versa. If a nonconforming use is
changed to a conforming use, then the previous nonconforming
status shall become null and void.
C. Discontinuance. A nonconforming use, when discontinued, may be
resumed any time within one year from such discontinuance, but not
thereafter. The resumption may be of the same class or use, but shall

beyond the size of the nonconforming use when it first became
nonconforming. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded on
the land comprising the nonconforming use by a total
cumulative amount greater than 25% of the land mass that
encompassed the nonconforming use at the time the
nonconforming use first became nonconforming. This
expansion for either a nonconforming use within a building or
a nonconforming use on land cannot be expanded again after it
has reached 25% of the square footage of the nonconforming
use within the building or 25% of the square footage of the
land mass comprising the original nonconforming use.
(4) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall comply with the
dimensional and lot coverage requirements of the applicable

undeveloped lots are held in single ownership within a subdivision
which has been duly recorded prior to the effective date of this chapter,
which lots are individually not of the required minimum area or width
for the district in which they are situated, such lots shall be developed
in groups thereof in order to provide the minimum lot area and frontage
required for each structure and shall not be considered nonconforming
as to area or width.

ARTICLE X
Performance Standards
§ 184-77. Intent.
It is the intent of this article to reduce or avert adverse environmental
impacts caused by use and/or development of land in the Township. In
addition, it is the specific intent of this article to:
§ 184-78. Calculation of site capacity.
Land use and/or development shall be regulated by a calculation of site
capacity according to the net buildable acreage concept. The applicant shall
determine the net buildable acreage using the following method and submit
sufficient evidence in the form of plans and data to verify the calculations:
A. Provide standards to control the amount and type of open space and
pervious and impervious surfaces within developments.
B. Control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural
resources.
C. Minimize the adverse impacts of development on the Township's roads,
air quality, water supplies and existing neighborhoods.
D. Apply these standards to all activities in all zoning districts within the
Township, except where noted in this article.
A. Net buildable acreage calculations: [Amended 12-20-2011 by Ord.
No. 327]
From the gross acreage of the site, subtract the following:
Existing road rights-of-way acres
Ultimate rights-of-way of existing
road
acres
Noncontiguous land acres
100% of floodplain land acres
100% of wetlands acres
100% of ponds or lakes acres
50% of slopes from 15% to 25% acres
85% of slopes over 25% acres
50% of existing utility rights-ofway
acres
The result is net buildable acreage
(NBA)
acres
B. In the calculations in Subsection A above, the following shall apply:
§ 184-77 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-78
168:675
§ 184-79. Cluster development standards.
(1) Land separated by roads or railroads or land where the connecting
link is less than 50 feet wide is noncontiguous land.
(2) The identified floodplain area shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Limerick Townships Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance. [Amended 3-1-2016 by Ord. No. 364]
(3) Where two or more categories overlap, the overlapping acreage
shall be counted only once, using the most restrictive classification.
(4) Utility corridors owned in fee simple by the utility shall not be
counted towards the applicant's land area.
C. Density calculations. To determine the number of units permitted on a
given site, multiply the net buildable acreage by the permitted density
listed in the standards for each zoning district, rounding to the nearest
whole number. Density will differ within each district depending on type
of development (traditional, cluster or lot averaging) and the presence
of central or on-site water and sewer service.
A. Intent. The intent of these standards is to:
(1) Protect environmentally sensitive areas, such as floodplains,
groundwater recharge areas, steep slopes, woodlands, historic
features and other uniquely valuable sites.
(2) Provide more usable and suitable open space and recreation for
community residents than would normally be provided.
(3) Provide for a more creative, flexible and efficient pattern of roads
and utilities than would occur under traditional lotting.
B. Clustering is encouraged in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Residential Districts.
The R-4 and R-5 Districts use the concepts of cluster development by
providing for common open space for higher density housing.
C. Open space. Open space in cluster developments shall meet the
requirements of § 184-82 of this chapter and the following additional
requirements: [Amended 12-20-2011 by Ord. No. 327]
(1) (Reserved)
(2) A buffer area at least 75 feet in width shall be provided along the
external road frontage of a cluster development. The buffer area
shall not be lotted out to homeowners and not included in the
setback areas.
D. Tract size; dimensional standards. The minimum tract size required for
any cluster development is 10 acres. All dimensional standards are
covered in the regulations for the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Districts.

E. Water and sewer. All properties developed in accordance with the
cluster development regulations shall be connected to public water and
sewer facilities. [Added 5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 249]
A. Whenever a landowner or developer undertakes the development of a
single tract which is situate in multiple residential zoning districts, the
owner or developer may submit plans with sufficient detail and in
accordance with Subsection E demonstrating the total number of
dwelling units permitted if each portion is developed according to the
district in which it is situate. The Supervisors, following consideration
and review by the Planning Commission, may permit development of
the entire tract as one unified development and intersperse the total
number of residential dwelling units throughout the entire tract so long
as the bulk, ground cover and dimensional requirements of the more
restrictive residential district shall be observed.
B. The unified development concept shall not be permitted for multitenant
or multiunit building usage.
C. The unified development concept shall be applicable only in the R-1 and
R-2 Zoning Districts.
D. The minimum tract size for application of the unified development
concept shall be 20 acres.
E. Section 184-78, entitled "Calculation of site capacity," and the net
buildable acreage concept shall be utilized to determine the total
number of dwelling units permitted.
F. Public water and sewer facilities shall be required.
G. Open space in accordance with § 184-82 shall comprise no less than
50% of the net buildable acreage of the tract.
A. Intent. The intent of these standards is to:
(1) Maximize lotting flexibility while protecting environmentally
sensitive areas without creation of significant common open space.
(2) Foster the preservation of agricultural uses and retain rural
character by allowing creation of large estate-type lots that are
suitable for agricultural purposes.
(3) Increase the variety and interest of single-family residential
development by providing for a wide range of lot sizes.
B. Lot averaging is encouraged in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Residential
Districts.
§ 184-79 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-80
168:677
§ 184-81. Protected areas.
Site alterations, regrading, filling or clearing of vegetation by a landowner
or developer which would violate the following standards shall be a violation
of this chapter. The landowner or developer is responsible for determining
the presence of the following natural features on the site and for meeting
the following standards:
C. Under lot averaging, minimum lot sizes and dimensional standards are
those permitted under cluster development, while densities are the
same as those permitted under traditional lotting. A minimum average
lot size is required to ensure a suitable range of lot sizes. Specific
dimensional standards are included in the regulations of the R-1, R-2
and R-3 Districts.
D. All lots capable of being further subdivided shall be deed restricted
against further subdivision by a deed of easement, which will designate
the owner, his heirs, successors and assigns as the grantee of the
easement and shall also designate Limerick Township as the third party
donee beneficiary. The restrictions of the easement shall be enforceable
either by the grantee, his heirs, successors and assigns or by the
Township.
A. Floodplains. All such lands shall remain as permanent green areas.
Floodplains are further regulated by the Limerick Townships Flood
Damage Prevention Ordinance. [Amended 6-2-1998 by Ord. No.
196; 3-1-2016 by Ord. No. 364]
B. Floodplain soils. In areas where a floodplain boundary has not been
designated, floodplain soils shall remain as permanent green area.
[Amended 3-1-2016 by Ord. No. 364]
C. (Reserved)258
D. Woodlands. No more than 50% of any woodland may be cleared or
developed. The remaining 50% shall be maintained as permanent green
area.
E. Lakes, ponds, wetlands or watercourses. These areas shall be left as
permanent open areas. No development, filling, piping or diverting of
such areas shall be permitted except for required roads.
F. Lake and pond shorelines. These areas shall, to a distance of 100 feet
from the shorelines, contain no more than 10% impervious coverage. At
least 90% shall remain as permanent green area.

present which covers an area to be occupied by permanent
structures or permanently located materials of an impervious
nature or ponds and lakes may be considered excess and may be
removed by the owner.
(2) During regrading operations conducted upon premises, whether or
not carried on in conjunction with on-site construction, excess
topsoil remaining after restoring proper topsoil cover (at least
eight inches) to the areas of the parcel upon which regrading
operations were conducted may be removed by the owner.

the Limerick Township Official Map.
(c) No building lot shall be created unless it contains sufficient
buildable area with slopes less than 25%. If it is infeasible to
provide this buildable area in accordance with the setbacks
required by the underlying district, the lot area shall be
increased as necessary to provide a buildable area equal to at
least 1/2 the building envelope provided by the minimum lot
dimensional standards of the underlying district.
(9) Certificate of compliance. No steep slope areas shall be occupied
until a certificate of compliance and as-built plans have been
submitted to the Township by a registered professional engineer
and/or land surveyor, as applicable, that the construction of any
buildings or other improvements or any other changes was
accomplished in compliance with this Subsection I.
(10) Limit of municipal liability. The granting of a zoning use permit or
the approval of a subdivision or land development plan on or near
the Steep Slope District shall not constitute a representation,
guaranty, or warranty of any kind by the Township or any official or
employee thereof regarding the practicability or safety of the
proposed use and shall not create liability upon the Township, its
officials, or its employees. Protections provided by this Subsection I

the corresponding percentage in Table 1 below for each of the five
time periods.
§ 184-87 LIMERICK CODE § 184-89
168:696
(3) Calculate the column total for each time period.
(4) The column total with the highest value is the shared parking
requirement.

ARTICLE XXVIII
Pottstown-Limerick Airport Zoning District
§ 184-191. Intent.
It is the intent of this article to regulate and restrict the height of structures
and objects of natural growth and otherwise regulate the use of property
in the vicinity of the Pottstown-Limerick Airport by creating the appropriate
zones and establishing the boundaries thereof; providing for changes in
the restrictions and boundaries of such zones; defining certain terms used
herein; referring to the Pottstown-Limerick Airport Zoning Map, which
is incorporated in and made a part of this article;291 providing for
enforcement; establishing an appeals process; and imposing penalties.
§ 184-192. Purpose.
This article, which may be cited as the "Pottstown-Limerick Airport Zoning
District," is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Airport
Zoning Act of 1984, P.L. 164, 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5911 et seq., as amended, and
Act 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code of 1968, P.L. 805,
53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., as amended.
A. It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering
the lives and property of users of the Pottstown-Limerick Airport and
property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may
affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the
Pottstown-Limerick Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the
size of areas available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of
aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Pottstown-
Limerick Airport and any public investment therein. Accordingly, it is
declared that:
(1) The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of
being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Pottstown-Limerick Airport;
(2) It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions
that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
(3) The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to
the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power
without compensation.
B. It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or
establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal,
alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation or marking and
lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a municipality
may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet
from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the
center line of the runway.
B. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than 3/
4 Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of
the runway.
C. Transitional Zones. The Transitional Zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
D. Horizontal Zone. The Horizontal Zone is established by swinging arcs of
5,000 feet radii for all runway designated utility or visual and 10,000
feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of
each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent
to those arcs. The Horizontal Zone does not include the approach and
Transitional Zones.
E. Conical Zone. The Conical Zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
A. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of
the zones in question as follows:
(1) Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: slopes 20
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway center
line.
(2) Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater
Than 3/4 Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: slopes 34
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway
center line.

§ 184-196. Use restrictions.
The following use restrictions shall apply:
§ 184-197. Nonconforming uses.
Nonconforming uses shall be governed by the following:
and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet
above the airport elevation, which is 311 feet above mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height
limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the
conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the
same elevation as the approach surface and extending a horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the
extended runway center line.
(4) Horizontal Zone: established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
or at a height of 461 feet above mean sea level.
(5) Conical Zone: slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet
above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet
above the airport elevation.
B. Exceptions to height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure or growth of any tree up to the height limits established by
other applicable Township zoning district limits or this article,
whichever is lower.
A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such
a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals
or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it
difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights,
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any
way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of
aircraft intending to use the airport.
A. Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this article
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of a use made nonconforming by the adoption of this
article. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
§ 184-195 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 184-197
168:803

section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the
FAA to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport
the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall
be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Pottstown-
Limerick Airport.
A. Future uses. Except as specifically provided in Subsection A(1), (2) and
(3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit thereof shall have
been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
detail to determine whether the resulting use, structure or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is
in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted subject to the other
requirements and conditions of this section. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a
variance has been granted in accordance with Subsection D.
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because
of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such
tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such approach zones.
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic features, would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
§ 184-197 LIMERICK CODE § 184-198
168:804
(4) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or
alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of
the height limits established by this article, except as set forth in
§ 184-195.
B. Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming
use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or
when the application for a permit is made.
C. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or
tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the
zoning regulations.
D. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to
the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance from such regulations. Prior to
submitting an application to the Zoning Hearing Board, the applicant
shall be required to submit FAA Form 7460-1 to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Form AV-57 to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly
found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will
result in unnecessary hardship and that the relief granted will not be
contrary to the public interest or create a hazard to air navigation.
[Amended 4-10-2008 by Ord. No. 294]
E. Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate
and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may
be necessary. If deemed proper by the Zoning Hearing Board, this
condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the airport, at
its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary
markings and lights.
F. FAA regulation update. In the event that any existing or future
regulation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), its successor
agency or the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is
inconsistent with any provision of this article, then such FAA or state

an alley or a local street, then the buffer yard shall be required
along such alley or local street, measured from the legal right-ofway
line. However, if a developer places a deed restriction that
permanently limits an area of landscaped land separated by a
street or in an adjacent municipality from being developed, and
such land area is between the business development and a

A. If Subsection A(1) below is met and at least two of the other three
following standards are met, in the determination of the Township, then
the maximum building coverage provided above shall be increased to
30% and the maximum impervious coverage provided above shall be
increased to 70%. Such standards shall be met in a manner that is

sides visible from a public street. Buildings over 300 feet in length
shall have the architectural appearance of being more than one
building as viewed from the front ground level, although the actual
roof may structurally be a single continuous line. Such variation
may be accomplished through variations in appearance of
rooflines, pillars, sloped roof extensions, canopies, variations of
appearance of materials and similar architectural features. Such
features shall be designed to avoid a long monotonous big-box
appearance.
B. If the bonus is approved under this § 184-218, and if so provided on an
approved subdivision and/or land development plan, then the applicant
may vary the maximum building coverage of 35% and a maximum
impervious coverage of 70%, provided that deed restrictions on other
lot(s) within the subdivision are created with more restrictive maximum
building and impervious coverage limits, so that an average maximum
building coverage of 30% and maximum impervious coverage of 70% is
maintained across the entire subdivision.

168:865
Planning Commission and a public hearing before the Board of
Supervisors. The applicant must establish the following for approval of
conditional use:
(1) The cost of erecting a monopole would preclude the provision of
adequate service to the public, or erection of a safe wireless
support structure;
(2) The proposed tower would have the least practical adverse visual
impact on the environment and closely resembles a monopole; and
(3) The proposed tower is architecturally compatible with surrounding
buildings and land use through location and design and blends in
with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
D. Wireless support structure safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that
the proposed antenna and wireless support structure are safe and the
surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by wireless support
structure failure, falling ice, or other debris. The applicant shall also

No. 379]
F. Landscaping. The following landscaping shall be required to screen as
much of the wireless support structure as possible, the fence
surrounding the wireless support structure, and any other ground-level
features (such as a building), and in general soften the appearance of
the wireless telecommunications services site. The Township may
permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls,
decorative fences, or other features instead of landscaping if they
achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If
the antenna is mounted on an existing structure and other equipment is
housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required.
(1) An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The
screen can be either a hedge (planted three feet on center
maximum) or a row of evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on center
maximum). The evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six
feet at planting and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet at maturity.

minimal visual impact for those residents in the immediate area and for
those in the larger community who view these facilities from a distance.
Minimal visual impact shall include the following:
(1) For facilities located in highly developed portions of the Township,
buildings may be used to accomplish the screening noted above.
(2) It is acknowledged that large, multi-use wireless support structures
located within major use transmission areas cannot be effectively
screened. In order to minimize the visual impact, such new
facilities should be located in close proximity to other comparable
structures. Accompanying buildings, ground-mounted antennas,
and other equipment and structures shall be subject to screening
recommendations.
(3) FAA requirements for coloring and lighting of wireless support
structures supersedes Township requirements for visual minimum
impact.
(4) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must
be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with,
the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.

multiple operators sharing use of a single wireless support structure,
this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
operations. [Amended 8-15-2017 by Ord. No. 379]
M. Site plan. A full site plan and written report containing the information
required in § 184-239D(3) shall be submitted by the applicant in every
instance except as provided in § 184-239C.
A. Penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has
violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this article shall,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Township as a result thereof. Each day that the violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. In addition to an action to enforce any
penalty imposed by this section and any other remedy at law or in
equity, the Township may apply to a Federal District Court for an
injunction or other appropriate relief at law or in equity to enforce
compliance with or restrain any violation of any provision of this article.
B. Determination of violation. In the event a determination is made that a
person has violated any provision of this article, such person shall be
provided with written notice of the determination and the reasons
therefore. Except in the case of an emergency, the person shall have 30
days to cure the violation. If the nature of the violation is such that it
cannot be fully cured within such time period, the Township may, in its
reasonable judgment, extend the time period to cure, provided that the
person has commenced to cure and is diligently pursuing its efforts to
cure. If the violation has not been cured within the time allowed, the
Township may take any and all actions authorized by this section and/or
federal and/or Pennsylvania law and regulations.
A. Police powers. The Township, by granting any permit or taking any
other action pursuant to this article, does not waive, reduce, lessen or
impair the lawful police powers vested in the Township under
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
B. Amateur radio. This article shall not govern any tower, or the
installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned
and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio status operator.
