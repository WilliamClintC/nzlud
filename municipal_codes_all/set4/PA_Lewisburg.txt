intended:
A. That certain private properties require a disproportionate amount of
police service with many calls requiring response to maintain order and
public peace and safety and to stop public disturbances at parties or
other social events so that there is less police personnel and resources
available for other locations, emergencies and duties within the
Borough, thereby placing a disproportionate and unfair burden upon
the residents of the Borough.

persons attending such party or event should be held criminally
responsible for any public disturbances or other acts of disorderly
conduct thereat.
C. That the owners of private properties derive a benefit from the
aforesaid police service.
D. That owners of private properties have a responsibility to manage their
properties to minimize required police service to maintain order and
public peace and safety and to stop public disturbances, to minimize the
burden upon the residents of the Borough and to promote the health,
safety and welfare of the public in general.
E. That owners of private properties can minimize required police service
to maintain order and public peace and safety and to stop public
disturbances by diligent and strict management and regulation of their
properties.
F. That assessment of police service costs as provided in this article is
reasonable and will have a deterrent effect and encourage more
responsible management of private properties.
G. That it is not the intent of this article to discourage or suppress calls or
requests for police service, but rather to encourage and stimulate
diligent and strict management and regulation of private properties by
the owners thereof and to promote the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Borough.

authorized to carry out all responsibilities stated in this chapter.
§ 174-2. Municipal certificate required.
No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter referred to as
the "insuring agent") doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located
within the Borough where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to
the structure under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insuring agent
is furnished by the Borough's Tax Collector with a municipal certificate
pursuant to § 508(b) of Act 98 of 1992, as amended, and unless there is
compliance with §§ 508(c) and 508(d) of Act 98 of 1992, as amended, and
the provisions of this chapter.

that, as of the date of the certificate or verbal notification, the Borough
has not certified any amount as total costs incurred by the Borough for
the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the

chapter, the insuring agent shall return the bill to the Borough's Tax
Collector and transfer to the Borough's Tax Collector an amount from the
insurance proceeds necessary to pay the taxes, assessments, penalties,
charges and costs as shown on the bill. The Borough shall receive the
amount and apply or credit it to payment of the items shown in the bill.
§ 174-5. Payment of claim.
Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to § 174-3A of this chapter, the
insuring agent shall pay the claim of the named insured in accordance with
the policy terms; provided, however, that if the loss agreed to between
the named insured and the insuring agent equals or exceeds 60% of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or other
structure, the following procedures shall be followed:
B. A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property as of the
date specified in the said request that have not been paid as of the date
of the certificate and also showing, as of the date of the certificate, the
amount of the total costs, if any, certified to the Borough's Tax Collector
that have been incurred by the Borough for removal, repair or securing
of a building or other structure on the property. For the purposes of this
subsection, the Borough shall certify to the Borough's Tax Collector the

Borough Manager in the aggregate $2,000 for each $15,000 and for
each fraction of that amount of a claim (this subsection to be applied

companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other
structure.
C. After the aforesaid transfer, the named insured may submit a

securing the building or other structure, in which event the Borough
Manager shall return the amount of the funds transferred to the

Borough Council may from time to time by resolution adopt procedures and
regulations to implement Act 98 of 1992, as amended, and this chapter

limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred
by the Borough in connection with such removal, repair or securing
of the building or other structure or any proceedings related
thereto;
(2) It is the obligation of the insuring agent when transferring the
proceeds to provide the Borough with the name and address of the
named insured. Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the name

contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been
received by the Borough and notify the named insured that the
procedures under this subsection shall be followed;
(3) When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable
regulations and orders of the Borough and the required proof of
such completion received by the Borough Manager, the fund shall
be returned to the name insured if the Borough has not incurred
any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund to the Borough and
if excess funds then remain, the Borough shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured; and

insured, such interest shall belong to the Borough, but to the extent
that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned
on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the
time that the proceeds are returned.
E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this section
shall be construed to prohibit the Borough and the named insured from
entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the
named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.

unreasonable delay, the Borough Council or any officer or employee of the
Borough designated thereby for that purpose may give notice by posting

unsafe or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section.

General Provisions
§ 290-1. Long title.
This chapter establishes rules, regulations, and standards for regulating
land use activities and associated stormwater runoff within Lewisburg
Borough, County of Union, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; sets forth the
powers, duties and procedures to be followed by the Borough in
administering this chapter; and sets forth the penalties for violation thereof.
§ 290-2. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as and may be referenced and cited as the
Lewisburg Borough Stormwater Management Ordinance.
§ 290-3. Authority.
The Borough is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff
by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, 32 P.S., P.L. 864 (Act
167), Section 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Stormwater Management
Act. Stormwater management is also authorized by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 of 1968, P.L. 805; P.S. § 10101, and
by the Borough Code, Act 581 of 1965, P.L. 1656; 53 P.S. § 45101.
§ 290-4. Statement of findings.
The Lewisburg Borough Council finds that:
§ 290-5. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
Lewisburg Borough by minimizing the damages described in § 290-4A of
this chapter through provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Borough and all the people of the
Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
A. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
§ 290-1 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-5

(BMP's) for stormwater management. Applicants are urged to consult
the Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for
Developing Areas and with the Municipal Engineer and the County
Conservation District. All stormwater designs are subject to the
approval of the Municipal Engineer. The Borough may request specific
information on design and/or operating features of the proposed
stormwater controls in order to determine their suitability and
adequacy in terms of the standards of this chapter.
F. All stormwater management facilities including detention basins,
BMP's, sewers, and culverts shall be designed by an individual qualified
and/or experienced in their design. These qualifications should be listed
on the front cover of the plan narrative.
G. The anticipated peak rate of stormwater runoff from the site during and
after full development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from the
site prior to development activities, measured in accordance with the
standards and criteria of this chapter.
H. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches but shall be allowed to drain to the land surface to
promote overland flow and infiltration of stormwater.
I. Existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without permission of the affected
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge
criteria specified in this chapter.
J. If existing diffused stormwater flow is proposed to be concentrated the
applicant must document that adequate downstream conveyance
facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or
otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other harm
will result from concentrated discharge.
K. Storm sewers, swales, culverts and bridges.
(1) Storm sewers, swales, culverts, bridges, and related facilities shall
be provided to:
(a) Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses;
(b) Insure the drainage of all points along the line of streets;
(c) Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at reasonable
intervals related to the extent and grade of the area drained,
and to prevent the flooding of intersections and the undue
concentration of Stormwater; and
§ 290-16 LEWISBURG CODE § 290-16
290:182
§ 290-17. Water quality requirements.
(d) Insure unrestricted flow of stormwater under driveways, and
at natural watercourses or drainage swales.
(2) Consideration should be given to anticipated up slope
development.
L. All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems and/or areas of
surface water concentration shall be maintained in their existing
conditions unless an alteration is approved by the Borough due to
topographic conditions.
M. Easements shall be provided conforming to the line of all natural
streams, channels, swales, and drainage systems and other stormwater
infrastructure installed to comply with this chapter. The terms of such
easements shall prohibit excavation, the placement of fill or structures
and any other alterations that may adversely affect the flow of
stormwater.
N. All stream encroachment activities, including work in and adjacent to
waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands, shall comply with applicable
PA DEP requirements.
O. Any stormwater facility located on a state or Borough highway right-ofway
shall be subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation or Lewisburg Borough.
P. Applicants are encouraged to incorporate designs to take advantage of
the stormwater credits presented in Appendix B14 of this chapter.
Q. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates; however, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.
R. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve
the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or
continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition.
A. For water quality, the objective is to provide adequate storage to
capture and treat the runoff from 90% of the average annual rainfall in
accordance with the following where P represents the depth of rain
associated with 90% of the total rainfall events over 0.11 inches.
(1) The size of the water quality facility shall be based upon the
following equation:
14.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 290-16 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-17
290:183
WQv = (1.2) (Rv)(A)
P = 1.2 inches of rainfall
12
Where:
WQv = water quality volume (in ac-ft)
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is percent impervious
cover
A = area in acres*
*Treatment of the WQv for off-site areas and areas not disturbed
is not required.
(2) Treatment of the WQv shall be provided at all developments where
stormwater management is required. A minimum WQv of 0.2
inches per acre shall be met at sites or in drainage areas that have
less than 15% impervious cover.
(3) The WQv shall be based on the impervious cover for the proposed
site. Off-site existing impervious areas may be excluded from the
calculation of the water quality volume requirements.
(4) When a project contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas,
the WQv shall be addressed for each drainage area.
(5) Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the WQv
calculations. Designers are encouraged to use these areas as
nonstructural practices for WQv treatment.
(6) Where structural practices for treating the recharge volume (Rev)
are employed upstream of a BMP, the Rev may be subtracted from
the WQv used for design.
(7) Where nonstructural practices are employed in the site design, the
WQv can be reduced in accordance with the conditions outlined in
Appendix B15 of this chapter.
(8) The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances
of clogging and sedimentation potential. Orifices smaller than
three inches diameter are not recommended. However, if the
design engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are
protected from clogging by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices
may be permitted.
15.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 290-17 LEWISBURG CODE § 290-17
290:184
(9) When designing flow splitters for off-line practices, consult the
small storm hydrology method provided in Appendix L16 of this
chapter.
B. To accomplish adequate water quality treatment the final WQv shall be
treated by an acceptable BMP from the list presented in Appendix M17
or an equivalent practice approved by the Municipal Engineer. The
applicant may submit original and innovative designs to the Municipal
Engineer for review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water
quality objectives through a combination of BMPs.
C. The water quality requirement can be met by providing a twenty-fourhour
draw down of a portion of the (WQv) in conjunction with a
stormwater pond or wetland system. Referred to as extended
detention (ED), this is different than providing the extended detention
of the one-year storm for the channel protection volume (Cpv). The ED
portion of the WQv may be included when routing the Cpv.
D. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the
applicant shall consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and topography.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Depth to bedrock.
(6) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(7) Erodibility of soils.
(8) Subgrade stability and susceptibility to sinkhole formation
(9) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(10) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(11) Stream bank erosion.
(12) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
(13) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(14) The nature of pollutants being removed.
(15) Creation and protection of wildlife habitat.

(16) Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
(17) Maintenance requirements.
E. Stormwater hotspots. If a site is designated as a stormwater hotspot as
per Table 302-1, it has important implications for how stormwater is
managed.
(1) A greater level of stormwater treatment is required at hotspot sites
to prevent pollutant wash off after construction.
(2) For areas designated as hotspots, a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan may be required to be designed and implemented
that contains operation practices at the site to reduce the
generation of pollutants by preventing contact with rainfall.
(3) Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans shall follow the
requirements of the U.S. EPA NPDES stormwater program.
(4) The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
(a) Residential streets and rural highways, residential
development, institutional development, commercial and office
developments, non-industrial rooftops, pervious areas except
for golf courses and nurseries. Large highways and retail
gasoline outlet facilities are not designated as hotspots
although it is important to ensure that stormwater plans for
these facilities adequately protect groundwater.

§ 290-18. Groundwater recharge requirements.
NOTES:
*Stormwater Pollution Plan implementation may be required
for these land uses or activities under the U.S. EPA NPDES
stormwater program.
A. Design of the infiltration/recharge stormwater management facilities
shall give consideration to providing groundwater recharge to
compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the
ground surface is paved and roofed over. These measures are
encouraged, particularly in hydrologic soil groups A and B and shall be
utilized wherever feasible.
B. The criteria for maintaining recharge is based on the USDA average
annual recharge volume per soil type divided by the annual rainfall in
Union County (40 inches per year) and multiplied by 90%. This keeps
the recharge calculation consistent with the WQv methodology. Thus,
an annual recharge volume requirement shall be specified for a site as
follows:
(1) Percent volume method.
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)]/12
Where:
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is percent impervious cover
A = site area in acres
(2) Percent area method.
Rev = (S)(Ai)
Where:
Ai = the measured impervious cover
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor
(S)
A 0.40
B 0.27
C 0.14
D 0.07
(3) The recharge volume is considered part of the total WQv that must
be provided at a site and can be achieved either by a structural
practice (e.g., infiltration, bioretention), a nonstructural practice
(e.g., buffers, disconnection of rooftops), or a combination of both.
§ 290-17 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-18
290:187
(4) Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the Rev
calculations. Designers are encouraged to use these areas as
nonstructural practices for Rev treatment.
(5) The Rev and WQv are inclusive. When treated separately, the Rev
may be subtracted from the WQv when sizing the water quality
BMP.
(6) Recharge/infiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with
other innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities,
and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
C. Basis for determining recharge volume.
(1) If more than one hydrologic soil group (HSG) is present at a site, a
composite soil specific recharge factor shall be computed based on
the proportion of total site area within each HSG. The recharge
volume provided at the site shall be directed to the most permeable
HSG available.
(2) The "percent volume" method is used to determine the Rev
treatment requirement when structural practices are used to
provide recharge. These practices must provide seepage into the
ground and may include infiltration and exfiltration structures
(e.g., infiltration, bioretention, dry swales or sand filters with
storage below the under drain). Structures that require
impermeable liners, intercept groundwater, or are designed for
trapping sediment (e.g., forbays) may not be used. In this method,
the volume of runoff treated by structural practices shall meet or
exceed the computed recharge volume.
(3) The "percent area" method is used to determine the Rev treatment
requirements when nonstructural practices are used. Under this
method, the recharge requirements are evaluated by mapping the
percent of impervious area that is effectively treated by an
acceptable nonstructural practice and comparing it to the
minimum recharge requirements.
(4) Acceptable nonstructural practices include filter strips that treat
rooftop or parking lot runoff, sheet flow discharge to stream
buffers, and grass channels that treat roadway runoff.
(5) The recharge volume criterion does not apply to any portion of a
site designated as a stormwater hotspot or any project considered
as redevelopment. In addition, the Municipal Engineer may alter or
eliminate the recharge volume requirement if the site is situated on
unsuitable soils (e.g., marine clays), karst or in an urban
redevelopment area. In this situation, nonstructural practices
(percent area method) shall be implemented to the maximum
extent practicable and the remaining or untreated Rev included in
the WQv treatment.
§ 290-18 LEWISBURG CODE § 290-18
290:188
§ 290-19. Channel protection storage volume (stream bank
erosion).
(6) If Rev is treated by structural or nonstructural practices separate
and upstream of the WQv treatment, the WQv is adjusted
accordingly.
D. Soils evaluation.
(1) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall
be performed by a qualified professional, and at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to
sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability. Advanced testing
methods such as the double ring test are encouraged. The
municipal engineer reserves the right to require an additional soils
evaluation when it is believed that test results are not reasonable.
(2) Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone
areas. Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or
chloride would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater. It is also
extremely important that the design professional evaluates the
possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and recommends a hydrogeologic
justification study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin will
be located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological
evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to
prevent ground water contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation.
(3) The Borough may require the installation of an impermeable liner
in detention basins underlain by limestone or in areas of karst
topography. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the Borough. The developer may also be required to
provide safeguards against groundwater contamination for uses
which may cause groundwater contamination, should there be an
accident or spill.
E. All recharge/infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely drain
within 72 hours of reaching maximum capacity.
A. Stream channel protection shall be considered in implementing the
standards of § 290-20 of this chapter. If a stormwater storage facility
needs to be constructed then, to protect channels from erosion, the
outflow structure shall be designed to provide twenty-four-hour
extended detention of the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event. The
§ 290-18 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-19
290:189
method for determining the Cpv requirement is detailed in Appendix
N18 of this chapter.
B. For discharges to streams having verified naturally reproducing wild
trout or that are stocked with trout (based upon the most recent
resource classification or other appropriate documentation of the
Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission or other appropriate agency),
only 12 hours of extended detention shall be provided. The rationale for
this criterion is that runoff will be stored and released in such a gradual
manner that critical erosive velocities during bankfull and near-bankfull
events will seldom be exceeded in downstream channels.
C. Basis for determining channel protection storage volume.
(1) The models HEC-HMS, TR-55 and TR-20 (or an equivalent
approved by the Municipal Engineer) shall be used for determining
peak discharge rates.
(2) The rainfall depth for the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event in
Union County is 2.2 inches.
(3) Off-site areas shall be modeled as present land use in good
condition for the one-year storm event.
(4) The length of overland flow used in time of concentration (tc)
calculations is limited to no more than 150 feet.
(5) The Cpv storage volume shall be computed using the detention lag
time between hydrograph procedures outlined in Appendix N of
this chapter. The detention lag time (T) for a one-year storm is
defined as the interval between the center of mass of the inflow
hydrograph and the center of mass of the outflow hydrograph.
(6) Cpv is not required at sites where the one-year post-development
peak discharge (qi) is less than or equal to 2.0 cfs. A Cpv orifice
diameter (do) of less than 3.0 inches is subject to approval by the
Municipal Engineer and is not recommended unless an internal
control for orifice protection is used.
(7) Cpv shall be addressed for the entire site. If a site consists of
multiple drainage areas, Cpv may be distributed proportionately to
each drainage area.
(8) Extended detention storage provided for the Cpv does not meet the
WQv requirement (i.e., Cpv and WQv shall be treated separately).
(9) The stormwater storage needed for the Cpv may be provided above
the WQv storage in stormwater ponds and wetlands, thereby
meeting all storage criteria except Rev in a single facility with
appropriate hydraulic control structures for each storage
requirement.

§ 290-20. Overbank and extreme event flood protection
requirements.
For a site located within two or more districts the peak discharge rate
from any sub-area shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that
sub-area. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether
the grading plan changes the drainage area by sub-area. Pre-development
and post-development runoff for specific sites shall be computed using an
approved method as per Table 307-1 for the two- , ten- , twenty-five- , fifty-
, and one-hundred-year storm.
(10) Infiltration is not recommended for Cpv control because of large
storage requirements.
A. Bull run watershed. The Bull Run Watershed Release Rate Percentage
Maps in Appendix I19 of this chapter illustrate the release rate subareas
and define the percentage of pre-development peak rate of runoff that
can be discharged from an outfall on the site after development. The
release rates are also shown in Table 305-1. The release rates apply
uniformly to all land development or alterations within a subarea.
Procedures for applying the release rate percentage are contained in

C. West Branch Susquehanna River. The release rate within the West
Branch Susquehanna River Watershed within Lewisburg Borough is
100%. For sites that discharge directly to the Susquehanna River the
Municipal Engineer may waive the requirements of this section.
However, safe conveyance of runoff must be demonstrated for the two- ,
ten- , twenty-five- , fifty- and one-hundred-year design storms. The
Borough reserves the right to require that the release rates be met.
Procedures for applying the release rates are in Appendix J.22
A. All storm sewers shall be able to convey the post-development runoff
from a ten-year design storm without surcharging inlets and shall be

constructed using Penn DOT Form 408 Specifications, Standard Details,
unless otherwise directed by the Municipal Engineer. When connecting
to an existing storm sewer system the applicant must demonstrate
that the proposed system will not exacerbate any existing stormwater
problems.
B. Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge into any municipal sanitary
sewer line or over a sidewalk.
C. Inlets shall be placed at the curb line where a curbed section is
installed. Inlets required for parallel or cross drainage without a curbed
section shall be set at the centerline of the ditch.
D. Structures shall be Penn DOT Type M pre-cast concrete or cast-in-place
Class A concrete. Brick or block structures shall not be permitted. Solid
concrete block or brick may be incorporated into a structure only for
grade adjustment of the casting.
E. All water obstructions (bridges, culverts, outfalls or stream enclosures)
shall have ample waterway opening to carry expected flows, based on a
minimum post-development peak storm frequency of 25 years and shall
have a minimum of one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway.
F. Bridge and culvert construction shall be in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation specifications and shall
meet the requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
G. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall
under PA DEP Chapter 105 Regulations must be able to convey, without
damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the ten-year
design storm. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater
management facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to
convey the design flow to or from that structure.
H. Roadway crossings located within designated floodplain areas shall be
able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm.
I. Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring an earthen berm or embankment shall be designed to provide
an emergency spillway to handle flow up to and including the onehundred-
year post-development conditions. The height of the
embankment must be set as to provide a minimum of one foot of
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation computed when the
facility functions for the one-hundred-year post-development inflow.
J. Stormwater management facilities that require a dam safety permit
under PA DEP Chapter 105 shall meet the applicable dam safety
requirements that may require the facility to pass storms larger than
the one-hundred-year event.
§ 290-21 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-21
290:193
K. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
L. Detention basins for stormwater peak discharge storage shall comply
with the following criteria:
(1) Basins shall be installed prior to any earthmoving or land
disturbance that they will serve. The phasing of their construction
shall be noted in a narrative and on the plan.
(2) Basins located in an area underlain by limestone may require a
geologic evaluation of the proposed location to determine
susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all facilities
over limestone formations shall include measures to prevent
ground water contamination and, where necessary, sinkhole
formation. The Borough may require basins located over limestone
to have an impermeable liner.
(3) Soils used for the construction of basins shall have low erodability
factors ("K factors").
(4) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainage ways discharge to or from basins.
Discharge from basins shall be into a natural waterway or
drainageway.
(5) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed one foot vertical
per three feet horizontal and may be further reduced if the soil has
unstable characteristics.
(6) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed one foot vertical per
three feet horizontal except with the approval of the Municipal
Engineer. Where concrete, stone, or brick walls are used for
steeper interior slopes, the basin shall be fenced with a permanent
wire fence at least 42 inches in height and a ramp of durable, nonslip
materials for maintenance vehicles shall be provided for basin
access.
(7) Outlet structures within basins which will control peak discharge
flows and distribute the flows by pipes to discharge areas shall be
constructed of concrete, polymer-coated steel or aluminum and
shall have childproof, non-clogging trash racks over all design
openings exceeding 12 inches in diameter, except those openings
used to carry perennial stream flows. Small outlet structures may
be constructed of Schedule 40 PVC.
(8) Where spillways will be used to control peak discharges in excess
of the ten-year storm, control weirs shall be constructed of
concrete of sufficient mass and structural stability to withstand the
pressures of impounded waters and outlet velocities.
§ 290-21 LEWISBURG CODE § 290-21
290:194
§ 290-22. Calculation methodology.
(9) Concrete outlet aprons shall be designed as level spreaders and
shall extend at a minimum to the toe of the basin slope. The
incorporation of any large stone found on the site into the concrete
apron to provide a more natural appearance is encouraged.
(10) Inlet and outlet structures shall be located at maximum distance
from each other. The Borough may require a rock filter berm or
rock-filled gabions between inlet and outlet areas when the
distance is deemed insufficient for sediment trappings.
(11) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall
be established on the sides of all earthen basins within 15 days of
initial construction.
A. Stormwater calculations to determine runoff, peak flow rates, peak
discharge, hydrographs and to design stormwater runoff rate reduction
facilities shall use a generally accepted calculation technique that is
based on the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil-Cover
Complex method. Table 307-1 summarizes acceptable methods.
B. It is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design
professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of each
method for a particular site. The Borough may allow the use of the
Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that
contain 200 acres or less; however, the Rational Method shall not be
used to generate pseudo-hydrographs for drainage areas greater than
10 acres.
C. For predevelopment flow rate determination it shall be assumed that all
undeveloped and pervious land shall be considered as "meadow" in
good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number or Rational "C" value (i.e., forest) as listed in Appendix C
or Appendix D of this chapter.23
D. All calculations using the Soil Cover Complex method shall use the
appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms
as presented in the table in Appendix E24 of this chapter. If a hydrologic
computer model such as PSRM or HEC-HMS is used for stormwater
runoff calculations then the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The
SCS "S" curve shown in Appendix F25 of this chapter shall be used for
the rainfall distribution.
E. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland flow
and return periods from the Design Storm Curves from PA Department

calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced
from time to time by NRCS). Times of concentration for channel and

A. For any proposed development site not located in a provisional direct
discharge district, the developer has the option of using a less
restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the developer can
prove that "no harm" would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff
rate than that specified by the Plan. The no-harm option is used when a
developer can prove that the post-development hydrographs can match
pre-development hydrographs, or if it can be proved that the postdevelopment
conditions will not cause increases in peaks at all points
downstream. Proof of no-harm would have to be shown based upon the
following Downstream Impact Evaluation which shall include a
downstream hydraulic capacity analysis consistent with § 290-23B of
this chapter to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists. The
land developer shall submit to the Municipality this evaluation of the
impacts due to increased downstream stormwater flows in the
watershed.
(1) The Downstream Impact Evaluation shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of
hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development
§ 290-22 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 290-23
290:197
upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted
streamflow or any stream channel section, established with the
concurrence of the Municipal Engineer.
(2) The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow
diminishes due to additional flow from tributaries and/or stream
attenuation.
(3) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two- , ten- , twenty-five- , fifty- and
one-hundred-year) shall be the values from the calibrated model
used for the analysis and preparation of the particular Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan. These flow values can be obtained
from the applicable watershed plan.
(4) Developer-proposed runoff controls that would generate increased
peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by
definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove noharm,
except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with § 290-21G.
(5) A financial distress shall not constitute grounds for granting a noharm
exemption.
(6) Capacity improvements may be provided by the developer as
necessary to implement the no-harm option, which proposes
specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent
discharge control would not create any harm downstream.
(7) Any no-harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV of this chapter.
(8) Qualification of no-harm does not relieve the applicant of the other
provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to the water
quality, groundwater recharge and channel protection volume
requirements of §§ 290-17, 290-18 and 290-19 of this chapter.
B. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating
any hazard to persons or property.
§ 290-23 LEWISBURG CODE § 290-23
290:198
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.

§ 300-1. Removal of grass, weeds and other obstructions. [Amended
10-20-1987 by Ord. No. 833]
It shall be the duty of all owners of vacant properties or the occupants
of improved premises to remove from the gutters and along the sidewalks
all grass and weeds and other obstructions interfering with the free and
full use of the same, and to keep the same removed from the gutters and
sidewalks in the Borough.
§ 300-2. Notice to remove, trim or cut; removal by Borough; costs.
[Amended 10-20-1987 by Ord. No. 833]
The Borough Council, or any officer or employee of the Borough designated
thereby for this purpose, is hereby authorized to give notice, by personal
service or by United States mail, to the owner or occupant, as the case
may be, of any premises whereon grass, weeds or other vegetation is
growing or remaining in violation of the provisions of § 300-1 of this article,
directing and requiring such occupant to remove, trim or cut such grass,
weeds or vegetation so as to conform to the requirements of this article,
within five days after issuance of such notice. Whenever, in the judgment of
the Enforcement Officer it shall appear to be impracticable to give notice
as above provided, either because the owner or occupant cannot readily
be found or because a search for the owner or occupant would entail
unreasonable delay, the Borough Council or any officer or employee of the
Borough designated thereby for that purpose, may give notice by posting
conspicuously on the property where such nuisance exists, a notice or order
directing and requiring that such nuisance be abated within 10 days. In
case any person, firm or corporation shall neglect, fail or refuse to comply
with such notice within the period of time stated therein, the Borough

after receipt of such notice and to also pay an administrative charge in the
amount of $10. Whenever, in the judgment of the designated official, it shall
appear to be impracticable to give the aforesaid notice, either because the
owner cannot readily be found or because a search for the owner would
entail unreasonable delay, the Borough Council, or any officer or employee
of the Borough designated thereby for this purpose, may give such notice
by posting conspicuously on the property whereon snow or ice is remaining
in violation of the provisions of § 300-14 of this article, a notice or order to
conform to the requirements of this article within one day after the posting
of the said notice or order and to also pay an administrative charge in the

The following words used in this article shall have, unless the context

and this article.

A. Excavations in paved streets owned and maintained by the Borough
degrade and shorten the life of the surface of the streets, and this
degradation increases the frequency and cost to the public of necessary
resurfacing, maintenance and repair. It is appropriate that entities
responsible for excavating into the Borough's rights-of-way bear this
burden rather than the taxpayers of the Borough. In addition,
establishment of variable fees will create an incentive for coordination
of efforts in excavating the streets to lay or rehabilitate utilities in
conjunction with the Borough's street improvement schedule.
B. The purpose of this article is to regulate the placement and
maintenance of utilities within areas designated as public rights-of-way
within the Borough of Lewisburg. This article is adopted to maintain the
safe condition of the public right-of-way to protect public health, safety
and welfare.

A. Sketch plan.
B. Preliminary plan.
C. Final plan (includes minor subdivision plans and lot addition and lot
consolidations plans).
D. As-built plan.
A. The purpose of the preapplication conference and review is to afford an
applicant opportunity to receive the advice and assistance of the
Borough regarding the procedures for submission of subdivision and
land development applications, as well as the standards and provisions
of this chapter, and to alert the applicant to other factors pertinent to
the design and effectuation of the subdivision or land development.
B. Although not required, a preapplication conference and review is
strongly recommended before submission of a formal plan, particularly
for proposals that involve the creation of new streets, stormwater
facilities, or proposals for new or expanded nonresidential structures.
C. The preapplication conference and review will not constitute the filing
of an application for approval, and all such meetings and/or review will
be considered informal. At the discretion of the applicant a proposal
may be presented at a public Borough Planning Commission meeting
for informal review and comment, and if deemed appropriate or
necessary by the Planning Commission, said proposal may then be
presented at a Borough Council meeting for informal review and
comment.
A. Plan submission deadlines.
(1) Subdivision, lot addition/consolidation, and land development
plans. Plans and supporting documentation will be submitted to the
Borough or designated administrator of this chapter with a

number of plans and other supporting documents to the Borough or
designated administrator and the Borough or designated
administrator has acknowledged that the application is complete.
Should the next monthly meeting of the Lewisburg Borough
Planning Commission be more than 30 days following the delivery
of the completed application to the Borough or designated
administrator, the date of plan receipt will be the 30th day
following the filing of the application.
C. Effect of filing date. After an application has been officially filed in
accordance with § 315-21B and while a decision is pending, no change
in any zoning, subdivision, or other local governing ordinance or plan
will affect the decision on the application adversely to the applicant,
and the applicant will be entitled to a decision in accordance with the
provisions of the local governing ordinances and regulations effective
on the official plan filing date.
A. Applicants are encouraged to submit a sketch plan during or after the
preapplication conference and review in order to present the overall
development concept of a particular tract before preparing and
submitting a formal preliminary or final plan.
B. The sketch plan, like the preapplication conference and review, is not
mandatory but is recommended.
C. Presentation of a sketch plan will not constitute the filing of an
application for approval of a plat. The applicant may present the sketch
plan at a Planning Commission meeting for informal review and
comment.
D. No formal action will be taken on a sketch plan submission, but the
Planning Commission and/or the Borough's consultant(s) may after
review and evaluation of the proposal notify the applicant in writing of
findings and recommendations regarding preparation of preliminary or
final plans.

ARTICLE VI
Design Standards for Proposed Improvements and Other
Requirements
§ 315-35. General requirements.
§ 315-36. Hazardous areas.
Those lands that are subject to hazards of life, health, or property as
may arise from fire, flood, disease, geologic conditions, excessive slopes,
contamination by hazardous materials and substances, unstable soils or
soils of inadequate weight-bearing strength and sites with very poor access
or considered to be uninhabitable for other reasons, will not be approved
for development unless the hazards have been eliminated or adequate
safeguards and/or remediation have been taken to the satisfaction of the
Borough Council to prevent further aggravation to and damage from such
hazards.
§ 315-37. Blocks.
A. The principles, standards, and requirements of this article will be
applied by the Borough Council in evaluating and reviewing proposed
subdivision and land development plans and will be considered the
minimum allowable standard. The Borough Council may impose more
restrictive standards where it is deemed appropriate or necessary in
order to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.
B. Land will be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
C. The location and design of all subdivisions and land developments will
conform to and be generally consistent with the Lewisburg Borough
Comprehensive Plan, the Union County Comprehensive Plan, and any
and all other plans and official maps duly adopted by the Borough and
County pertaining to subdivisions and land developments.
D. New subdivisions and land developments will be coordinated with all
existing or proposed developments on adjacent properties in order to
provide for the harmonious development of the entire area.
E. The location and design of all subdivision and land developments will
conform to the Lewisburg Borough Zoning Ordinance. The Borough
Council will not grant plan approval until the Borough Zoning Officer
certifies that the plan is consistent with local zoning requirements.
A. Blocks for residential developments will generally have a minimum
length of 300 feet and a maximum length of 1,000 feet.
B. Residential blocks will be of sufficient depth to accommodate two tiers
of lots. Exceptions to this may be permitted for double or reverse
frontage lots that border an arterial or collector street or where a
barrier such as a watercourse or railroad is present.
§ 315-35 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-37
290:303
§ 315-38. Lot standards.
C. The depth and width of blocks in nonresidential areas may vary from
§ 513-38A and B and will be determined by the nature of the use in
order to serve the public convenience. Nonresidential blocks will be
adequate to provide for safe and convenient traffic circulation, offstreet
parking and loading areas, setbacks, and landscaping as required
by this chapter and the Lewisburg Borough Zoning Ordinance.
A. General lot standards.
(1) Lots will be laid out to provide buildable areas, reasonable access,
usable yards, and open space areas with minimum disturbance to
the site.
(2) The soil, geologic, and topographic conditions of the site should be
compatible with proposed lot uses.
(3) The configuration of lots will be based upon the minimum and
maximum lot area requirements, the salient natural features,
existing improvements, proposed improvements and the adjacent
development pattern.
(4) Lot configurations should provide for safe vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
(5) Lots that are two or more times the minimum lot area requirements
will be designed with configurations that allow for additional
subdivision.
B. Specific lot requirements.
(1) Lot lines will follow zoning district boundaries rather than cross
them. Should a lot be divided by a zoning district boundary the
minimum standards of each district will apply.
(2) Side lot lines will be substantially at right angles or radial to street
lines.
(3) All lots will front on and have access to an existing or proposed
public street or a private street in accordance with §§ 315-43 and
315-50 of this chapter.
(4) Lots that require access to an arterial or collector street will be
avoided. Where lots adjoin arterial or collector streets access to
said lots will be from local streets, service roads, or marginal
access roads.
(5) Lots will be laid out and graded to provide proper drainage away
from all buildings.
(6) All portions of a tract will be developed so that no landlocked area
will be created.
§ 315-37 LEWISBURG CODE § 315-38
290:304
§ 315-39. Lot or area requirements.
The minimum lot or area requirements will be determined by the Lewisburg
Borough Zoning Ordinance.38

Building setback lines will be determined by the Lewisburg Borough Zoning
Ordinance.
§ 315-41. Monuments and markers.
(7) Corner lots will have additional width to permit sufficient setbacks
from both streets.
(8) Double frontage lots are prohibited except where provided as
reverse frontage lots to reduce driveway intersections along a
street with a high volume of vehicular movements.
A. All pins, monuments, and markers will be established by a professional
land surveyor licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The work
will be performed in accordance with criteria recognized by the
professional licensing board. No existing property line evidence will be
disturbed or removed in the course of establishing and locating
boundaries but will be located and identified on a property survey plan
and labeled as is deemed necessary to delineate ownership.
B. Monuments, pins, or markers will consist of the following materials and
dimensions and will be embedded no less than 30 inches:
(1) Monuments. Concrete will be at least four inches by four inches by
36 inches or similar circular area with a permanent distinguishing
magnetic mark identifying the point on the property.
(2) Pins and markers. Steel and other similar durable all weather
permanent marker materials will be at least 36 inches long and 1/2
inch in diameter. Railroad spikes or similar products can be used to
locate intersections of streets and property corners within paved
surfaces.
(3) For newly erected monuments it is recommended that a brightly
colored wooden stake at least one inch by two inches by 36 inches
be placed near the monument and/or colored flagging be placed on
the monument. Survey caps and underground magnetic markers
may also be utilized in conjunction with bars used for markers.
C. It is encouraged that all boundary surveys and monuments be located in
reference to the established control for the Union County GIS mapping.
Surveys and subdivisions that are located within 1,500 feet of a Union
County GIS Monument will be tied to that monument with bearings to

the nearest second and dimensions to the nearest hundredth of a foot
to identify the coordinates of at least two monuments.
D. Monuments will be placed at all newly established property corners and
right-of-way lines to identify the intersection of adjoining properties
separately deeded properties of the same ownership, and access, utility,
and drainage easements. Curved lines will be identified at the points of
tangent and changing degree of curvature.
E. In subdivisions of 10 lots or greater, a minimum of two permanent
reference monuments will be established in the external boundary of
the subdivision where the bar is set in concrete to meet the standards of
a monument.
F. Monuments for new subdivision or land development projects will be
set prior to final plan approval. Monuments disturbed during
construction will be reestablished by the professional land surveyor
promptly at the completion of construction activities, but in all cases
prior to any lot sale or building occupation.
G. Maintenance or removal. It will be the responsibility of the subdivider
or developer to see that all monuments or markers are properly
maintained until such time as the lot or tract is conveyed. Maintenance
of such monuments or markers will then become the responsibility of
the new owner. Any monuments or markers that are removed will be
replaced by a registered professional land surveyor at the expense of
the person(s) removing them.
A. Easements will be adjacent to property lines and street rights-of-way to
the fullest extent possible.
B. Nothing will be placed, planted, set, or put within an area of an
easement that would adversely affect the function of the easement or
conflict with the easement agreement.
C. Utility easements. The location and size of utility easements will be
reviewed and approved by the applicable utility company, but such
easements will not be less than 15 feet in width.
D. Drainage easements. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by an existing or proposed watercourse, drainage way,
channel, or stream, a drainage easement will be provided that conforms
substantially with the line of such feature at a width adequate to
preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage without damaging
adjacent property. The minimum width of drainage easements will be
15 feet.
§ 315-41 LEWISBURG CODE § 315-42
290:306
§ 315-43. Street system general arrangement.
The following criteria will be considered in the design of streets (including
private streets not dedicated) in all subdivisions and land developments.
E. Stormwater facility easements. Easements will be reserved where
stormwater drainage facilities exist or are proposed and will have a
minimum width of 15 feet extending from the top of bank of any basin,
channel, or berm. They will be adequately designed to provide an area
for the collection and discharge of water, the maintenance, repair, and
reconstruction of the drainage facilities and the passage of machinery
for such work, and to provide ingress and egress from a public right-ofway.
The easement will remain unobstructed at all times; excavation,
the placing of fill, the erecting of buildings or other permanent
structures or the making of any other alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement will be
prohibited.
F. Right of access and maintenance. All easements will clearly identify
who has the right of access and the responsibility for maintenance.
G. Easements, including easement maintenance provisions, will be
prepared in a format specified by the Union County Recorder of Deeds
Office and will be referenced in the deeds of the lots.
A. The arrangement of streets will minimize congestion, avoid hazardous
intersections and provide convenient and safe access to the
accompanying properties.
B. Proposed streets will be coordinated with adjacent existing or proposed
streets and will be planned and designed for the continuation of
existing streets in adjoining areas, the proper projection of streets into
adjoining undeveloped or unplatted areas, and the continuation of
proposed streets to the boundaries of the tract being developed. No
subdivision or land development will be approved that will result in a
tract or parcel of land being landlocked.
C. Streets will be laid out to be harmonious with the existing and proposed
site characteristics, including, but not limited to, slope, best use, parcel
layout, runoff, soil capacity, water table, floodplain, sight distance,
traffic volume and safety, pedestrian use, traffic control, and parking.
D. Curvilinear streets should be utilized only when the historic grid cannot
be extended due to the topography and natural features of the site and
when used will be consistent with adjoining development patterns
topography and natural features.
E. Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are prohibited.
F. Streets will be laid out to preserve the integrity of their engineering
design.
§ 315-42 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-43
290:307
G. Streets will be laid out to conform as much as possible to the
topography in order to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, to
minimize the number of streets necessary for convenient and safe
access and to result in usable lots and satisfactory street grades.
H. Streets which provide ingress and egress to residential areas of singleand
multiple-family dwellings will be laid out to discourage and
minimize their use by through traffic and to discourage excessive
speeds; however, street connectivity into and from adjacent areas is
encouraged and will generally be required.
I. If lots resulting from a subdivision or land development, including the
tract residual, are large enough for resubdivision, adequate street
right-of-way to permit further subdivision and land development will be
provided as necessary.
J. Where a subdivision or land development abuts a collector or arterial
street, the Borough Council may require an internal street system,
marginal access street, rear service street, reverse frontage lots,
shared driveways, or such other treatment as will provide protection for
abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections and
driveways with the collector or arterial street, and separation of local
and through traffic.
K. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access will be provided to all lots.
L. Where streets continue into adjacent municipalities, the applicant will
coordinate the design of the street with both municipalities in order to
ensure uniform cartway widths, pavement cross sections, and other
public improvements.
M. Streets will be designed with drainage grates that are safe for crossing
by bicycles and horse-drawn vehicles.
N. All streets being offered for dedication must meet the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) requirements for liquid fuel
allocation.
O. When streets are offered for dedication the applicant will provide the
required right-of-way, street geometry, street section, drainage
facilities, and traffic control. Additional infrastructure may be required
where design standards warrant further improvements based on traffic
impact studies.
P. Proposed private streets (those not offered for dedication) will meet all
the design standards of this chapter, including but not limited to rightof-
way, curbs, sidewalks, drainage, construction, traffic control, and
setbacks.
Q. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an existing
street right-of-way of improper width or alignment, the Borough
Council may require the dedication or reservation of additional land

290:308
§ 315-44. Traffic engineering report.
§ 315-45. Required rights-of-way and cartways.
sufficient to widen the street or correct the alignment. Where an
additional dedication or reservation is required, all building setback
lines will be measured from such dedicated or reserved right-of-way
line.
R. The Borough Council will have the right to determine the classification
of roadway and street systems. This determination, if necessary should
be obtained prior to the design process.
A. The applicant will prepare a traffic engineering report where any of the
following conditions exist:

accident location, a confusing intersection, or a congested
intersection that directly affects access to the subdivision or land
development.
(4) The ability of the existing roadway system to handle increased
traffic or the feasibility of improving the roadway system to handle
increased traffic is limited.
(5) The proposed development alters the transportation patterns on a
public street providing access to the development or proposes the
removal or relocation of a street.
B. The traffic engineering report will be prepared under the supervision of
qualified and experienced transportation engineers with specific
training in traffic and transportation engineering.
C. The traffic engineering report will at minimum be prepared in
accordance with PennDOT Publication 201 "Engineering and Traffic
Studies."
D. The scope of the traffic study will be reviewed and approved by the
Borough Council and Borough Engineer prior to commencement. The
scope will include the proposed intersection and roadway as well as the
surrounding impacted transportation facilities.
A. Right-of-way and cartway widths contained in this and other Borough
Ordinances are the minimum required for public streets based upon the
need to provide efficient movement of vehicles to serve utilities and to
accommodate ponding runoff storage of plowed snow emergency
§ 315-43 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-45
290:309
§ 315-46. Street design standards.
parking, temporary roadway adjustments during maintenance and
accidents, and future improvements.
B. The applicant will certify prior to final plan approval of a subdivision or
land development that the title to any street right-of-way proposed for
dedication is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and that no
prior right-of-way has been granted to any utility or any other person.
C. All rights-of-way and cartways designed for public dedication will be
designed in conformance with PennDOT's Liquid Fuels requirements.
Additionally, all right-of-way and cartway widths will be large enough to
incorporate all elements of the design cross sections, including
required cartway width, utility accommodation, landscape areas and
sidewalks where appropriate/required.
D. The Borough Council will reserve the right to require a right-of-way
width greater than PennDOT specifications and the standards set forth
in the Borough Zoning Ordinance for reasons of public safety and
convenience; to provide acceleration and deceleration lanes into
parking lots, streets, or high-density residential developments; or to
provide for future service roads.
E. The right-of-way and cartway width of a new public street that is a
continuation of an existing street will in no case be continued at a width
less than the existing street. Where the right-of-way and cartway width
of the new street is greater than the existing street, a transition area
will be provided the design of which is subject to Borough Council
approval.
F. All of the right-of-way will have a grade similar to the street grade. The
slope of banks adjacent to rights-of-way will be no steeper than the
following:
(1) One foot of vertical measurement for three feet of horizontal
measurement for fills.
(2) One foot of vertical measurement for two feet of horizontal
measurement for cuts.
G. Where a cut or fill abuts a sidewalk, there will be two feet of level area
adjacent to the sidewalk and the fill slope will not exceed a three-to-one
slope.
H. Private rights-of-way will be in accordance with those requirements
prescribed for private streets.
I. Where a subdivision or land development adjoins undeveloped acreage,
new streets or reserved rights-of-way will be provided to the boundary
lines of the development.
§ 315-45 LEWISBURG CODE § 315-46
290:310
A. Streets will be designed for a twenty-year service life. If a street is to be
utilized prior to completion of construction, the utilized portion must be
structurally designed to support all anticipated loading without
significant loss of the designed service life of the street.
B. Special consideration for future bus and truck routes must be taken into
account in the design of streets for pavement thickness and width, sight
distances and curb radii.
C. Streets located in floodplain or flood-prone areas will be designed and
constructed to meet the requirements of the § 315-59 of this chapter.
D. The existing level of service (LOS) as designated in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) published by the Transportation
Research Board on any adjacent street and intersection that will be
affected by a proposed subdivision or land development will not fall
below LOS C if it is currently at LOS A, B or C and will not be further
reduced if it is at LOS D, E or F.
E. Traffic calming techniques may be required by the Borough Council for
projects that result in high vehicular or pedestrian traffic, areas of
commercial development, and transition areas between commercial
and residential development. Techniques will be employed based on
PennDOT Publication 383.
F. Local roads. The design criteria shown in Table 6-1 will be considered
the minimum standards in the design of local roads serving all
subdivisions and land developments.

grade on any street will not exceed 12%; however, grades not more
than 16% may be used for limited distances less than 300 feet and
will be subject to the approval of the Borough Council upon
recommendation by the Borough Engineer prior to design. Refer to
Table 6-1.
(3) Grades at intersections will be as flat as possible. The grade of the
approach where the traffic is required to stop will not exceed 4%
grade change for 40 feet or greater depending on the stacking
length of the vehicles caused by high traffic volume areas. Refer to
Table 6-2 for further design requirements.
I. Horizontal alignment.
(1) Alignment between control points should conform to topography,
following closely the natural contours, consistent with the design
speed, the traffic volumes to be served, the right-of-way and the
construction cost.
(2) Horizontal curves will be designed in accordance with Table 6-1.
J. Intersections.
(1) Streets will intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no
street will intersect another at an angle of less than 75° or more
than 105°.
(2) No more than two streets will intersect at the same point.

feet, but should at all times be designed to safely accommodate the
intended vehicular traffic, e.g., combination trucks and buses.
Refer to Table 6-2 for additional minimum curb radii.
(4) The corner sight distances or clear sight triangle for each design
speed will be as specified in Table 6-2. The clear sight triangle will
be maintained as open space with no visual obstructions (Refer to
Figure 6-1).
(5) Sight distances for all intersection horizontal alignments, or
vertical alignments will be designed to achieve the required
minimum safe sight distances and safe stopping distances as
§ 315-46 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-46
290:313
specified in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Title 67,
Transportation, Chapter 441, as from time to time reenacted,
amended and/or replaced.
(6) Any street intersecting with another street will not be located
closer than the distances specified in Table 6-2. Distances will be
measured from the centerline of the two intersecting streets along
the centerline of said local, collector or arterial street.
(7) Any subdivision or land development that can be expected to
generate more than 200 vehicle trips per day may be required to
provide traffic control devices such as the following in order to
provide safe and efficient operation at any proposed driveway or
street:

in Penn DOT Design Manual, Part 2. "Highway Design."
M. Special streets.
(1) Culs-de-sac.
(a) A cul-de-sac will not be permitted when a through street is
feasible. The feasibility of a through street will be based on the
physical features of the tract proposed for development, the
potential for extension of the street to adjoining lands,
restrictions imposed by other government regulations, and the
ability to design to meet all other requirements of this chapter.
When culs-de-sac are proposed the application will be
accompanied by a written analysis of the merits of the design
and the reasons that a through street would not be feasible.
Approval of cul-de-sac streets will be at the sole discretion of
the Borough Council upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission.
(b) Culs-de-sac will be prohibited where it is possible to provide
loop streets that provide better access for emergency vehicles,
§ 315-46 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-46
290:317
fewer restrictions on snow removal and improved pedestrian
access.
(c) A cul-de-sac street will not exceed 500 feet in length as
measured from the centerline intersection with the through
street to the center point of the turnaround.
(d) Cul-de-sac streets will have a paved, circular turnaround with a
minimum radius to the curb line of 45 feet and the minimum
radius of the right-of-way lines will be 50 feet.
(e) An interior island may be permitted in the cul-de-sac
turnaround in residential areas at the discretion of the
Borough Council upon recommendation by the Borough
Engineer.
(f) The centerline grade on a cul-de-sac street will not exceed 10%
and the grade of the diameter of the turnaround will not
exceed 4%.
(g) Temporary culs-de-sac may have circular, T-shaped, or
hammerhead-shaped turnarounds. Turnarounds will be
constructed completely within the right-of-way. Restoration of
paved areas within the right-of-way will be the responsibility of
the developer connecting to the temporary cul-de-sac.
(h) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable
and is clearly demonstrated by the applicant to the Borough
Council the turnaround right-of-way will be placed adjacent to
the tract boundary with sufficient additional width provided
along the boundary line to permit extension of the street at full
width.
(2) Dead-end streets.
(a) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets or designed for future access to adjoining properties.
(b) Any dead-end street for access to an adjoining property or
because of authorized phased development will be provided
with a temporary all-weather turnaround. The use of such
turnaround will be guaranteed to the public until such time the

right-of-way width of 25 feet and a minimum cartway width of
20 feet.
(d) Corners will have a radius adequate to accommodate any large
vehicles that may be expected to use the alley.
(e) Dead-end alleys will not be permitted without an all-weather
turnaround.
(f) Alleys should be designed in accordance with the street
standards in § 315-46 of this chapter.
(5) Private streets.
(a) All streets will be designed as if they will be offered for
dedication as public streets.
(b) Private streets will be approved at the discretion of the
Borough Council.
(c) Private streets will be prohibited unless design objectives of
the development warrant private ownership, the street does
not serve more than five lots, and the Borough is not accepting
dedication of the street.
(d) If a street is designated as private the following conditions
must be met:
[1] A private right-of-way agreement will be properly executed
between the landowner granting the access and all
affected parties abutting and adjoining said access and
will create a private right-of-way not less than 50 feet in
width that will run with the land and be available for the
use of all owners, present and future. This agreement will
be reviewed by the Borough Engineer and approved by the
Borough Council prior to final plan approval.
[2] The adjoining landowners or an association of property
owners must agree that the street(s) will not be dedicated
but will be maintained by the adjoining landowners or
association of property owners.
[3] The adjoining landowners or an association of property
owners must agree to maintain the private street in a mudfree
condition and to provide for its repair and for snow
removal and any other necessary maintenance.
[4] An agreement must be entered into by the adjoining
landowners or an association of property owners that will
be recorded with the Union County Recorder of Deeds as
part of the final plan and subsequently reflected in the
deeds of all future lot owners. This agreement will
§ 315-46 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 315-46
290:319
§ 315-47. Street construction standards.
establish the conditions under which the street will be
constructed and maintained as well as conditions
controlling the offer of dedication and provisions for funds
sufficient to bring the private street to the standards
required for public streets should dedication occur.
(e) Private streets will be designed and built to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated and will
be constructed in accordance with the standards and criteria
established in §§ 315-45, 315-446, 315-48 and 315-50 of this
chapter.
(f) A notation will be included on the final plan and reflected in the
deeds of sold lots identifying the street right-of-way as
"private" and identifying the entity responsible for
maintenance.
(g) All gates on private streets will be located a minimum of 30

assigns fail to maintain the improvements following due notice by
the Borough to correct problems, the Borough may perform the
necessary work or corrective action and the owners or association
of property owners will reimburse the Borough for these services
and any administrative costs. The Borough will have the authority
to assert a judgment lien against the said owners or association of

maintenance of the improvements in accordance with § 315-77A

without the written approval of Borough Council.
(6) Provision that in the event improvements are altered, eliminated,
or improperly maintained the Borough may prescribe necessary
corrective measures and a reasonable time period to perform such
work. If corrective action is not taken in the time period specified
§ 315-77 LEWISBURG CODE § 315-77
290:352
the Borough may cause the work to be performed and invoice the
ownership and maintenance entity, including the assertion of a
judgment lien against it.
(7) Provision that all improvements not offered for dedication may be
offered in the future if the improvements meet the minimum
standards of this and/or applicable Borough ordinances in effect at
the time the offer of dedication is made. If the improvements do not
conform to the minimum standards in effect, the improvements
must be improved to meet the standards prior to the offer for public
dedication with all costs to improve the improvements being borne
by the owner, association of property owners, or their successors
and assigns. The Borough will have no obligation to accept the
improvements in any case.

Beginning with calendar year 2008, and continuing during each calendar
year thereafter, each occupation engaged in by individuals with a primary
place of employment within the Borough of Lewisburg shall be subject to a
tax in the amount of $52 per annum, said tax to be paid by the individual
so engaged. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each individual for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which an individual may be employed.
§ 324-5. Exemption; refunds.
A. Exemption. Any individual whose total earned income and net profits
from all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 during any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total, one-hundred-percent disability.

armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the tax
year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve component of
the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army Reserve,
United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve,
United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force
Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) An individual seeking to claim an exemption from the local services
tax shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough
and with the individual's employer affirming that the individual
reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the
Borough utilizes a Collector, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that Collector. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the individual's last pay stubs
or W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year
prior to the tax year for which the individual is requesting to be
§ 324-3 TAXATION § 324-5
324:363
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate
and until otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as
required by Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the
tax from the individual during the calendar year or the remainder
of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring.
(2) With respect to an individual who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
individual or by the Borough that the individual has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the
individual is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the individual of
earned income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the individual under Subsection B(3).
(3) If an individual who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the individual, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the individual due to the
exemption claimed by the individual under this subsection, plus the
per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of
tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in
that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of an individual subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the individual shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the Borough or the Collector may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility, or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the General Municipal
Law relating to refunds of overpayments (see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425 or as
hereafter amended) and interest on overpayments (see 53 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 8426 or as hereafter amended). Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to
remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is

later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for exempt
persons and provide refunds.
A. Each employer within the Borough of Lewisburg, as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Lewisburg but who engage
in business within the Borough of Lewisburg, is hereby charged with
the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by
him or performing for him within the Borough of Lewisburg and making
a return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer
is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the Borough of
Lewisburg.
B. An individual subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the individual is
engaged in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the
individual for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the
combined rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round
down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest
1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period
basis for each payroll period in which the individual is engaged in an
occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
C. No individual shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each individual for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which
an individual may be employed. The Borough or the Collector shall
provide a taxpayer with a receipt of payment upon request by the
taxpayer.
§ 324-5 TAXATION § 324-6
324:365
§ 324-7. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 324-8. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.

determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 324-9. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession with a primary place of
employment within the Borough of Lewisburg shall be required to comply

on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter of a calendar
year.
§ 324-10. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough or the Collector if
the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information
submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of
employment, the employee's principal office or where the employee is
principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for
payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount
withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions
of Subsection B of § 324-5 of this article and this section and remits the
amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services tax within 30
days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. Each individual who shall have more than one occupation within the

principal occupation, and his principal employer shall deduct the tax
and deliver to him evidence of deductions on a form to be furnished to
the employer by the Collector, which form shall be evidence of
deduction having been made and when presented to any other

from the employee's salary, wages or commissions but to include such

employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the

constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.

unpaid under this article, together with interest and penalty accruing
thereon. Nothing herein shall prevent the Borough of Lewisburg from
recovering any such tax due or unpaid, together with all interest and
penalty accruing thereon, the same as other debts of like amount are
recoverable.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of the tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of

imposed by this article who has commenced or who commences his
business less than one calendar year prior to the beginning of the tax
year, shall compute his annual estimated whole or gross volume of
business for such tax year by taking the monthly average of whole or

multiplying the same by 12.
C. Every person subject to the payment of the business privilege tax

whole or gross volume of business upon the actual whole or gross
amount of receipts received by or credited to him during such tax year.

business during any tax year does so before payment of his tax becomes
due for such tax year, he shall be permitted to apportion his tax for such

of the Borough's claim for tax. If it is thereafter judicially determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that the Borough has been overpaid,

provisions of this particular subsection shall be applicable to any and all
cases in which the facts are similar to those in a case actually litigated

General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in an Opinion dated
November 1, 1962. Residents or inhabitants of the Borough
assigned to another taxing district by military orders are

exonerated from payment of the per capita tax.

incomes is a guideline for Borough Council to consider in granting
exonerations from payment of the per capita tax to the Borough Tax
Collector. Income from all sources will be considered in
relationship to age, health, physical impairment and other

residents or inhabitants of the Borough who submit proof of
payment elsewhere shall be exonerated from payment of the per

taxable residents or inhabitants of the Borough. Taxable residents
or inhabitants who move out of the Borough anytime during the

County Assessor of his/her becoming of age or becoming a resident
or inhabitant of the Borough. Where proof of compliance is
required in Subsection C of this section, such proof shall be
established by either submitting to Borough Council an affidavit
from the Assessor of the Pennsylvania County in which legal
residence is claimed stating that the person is on the current tax
rolls in that County or proof of payment of the per capita tax as
provided in Subsection D(2) of this Subsection D.

exoneration from payment of the per capita tax on grounds of

324:408
§ 324-62. Powers and duties of officer.
required to withhold to the extent that such taxes have not been
recovered from the employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold earned income
taxes or for the payment of such withheld tax money to a political
subdivision other than the Borough if such failure to withhold or such
incorrect transmittal of withheld taxes arises from incorrect
information as to the employee's place of residence submitted by the
employee, nor shall an employer be liable for failure to withhold earned
income taxes, or to make reports of wages, salaries, commissions or
other compensation of his/her/its employees, unless the official
continuing register of all earned income taxes levied under the
authority of the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended, maintained and
supplemented annually by the Department of Community and Economic
Development, lists the Borough's levying of the earned income tax.
F. The failure or omission of any employer to make the deductions
required by this section shall not relieve any employee from the
payment of tax or from complying with the requirements of this article
relating to the filing of declarations and returns.
A. The Borough Council, by resolution, shall appoint the officer.
B. It shall be the duty of the officer to collect and receive the taxes, fines
and penalties imposed by this article. It shall also be his/her/its duty to
keep a record showing the amount received by him/her/it from each
person or business paying the tax and date of such receipt.
C. Each officer, before entering upon his/her/its official duties, shall give
and acknowledge a bond to the Borough. If the Borough shall, by
ordinance or resolution, designate any bond previously given by the
officer as adequate, such bond shall be sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of this subsection. Each such bond shall be joint and
several with one or more corporate sureties which shall be surety
companies authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and duly
licensed by the Insurance Commissioner of this Commonwealth. Each
bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the officer, his/
her/its clerks, assistants, appointees of all trusts confided in him/her/it
by virtue of his/her/its office, upon the faithful execution of all duties
required of him/her/it by virtue of his/her/its office, upon the just and
faithful accounting or payment over, according to law, of all monies and
balances thereof paid to, received or held by him/her/it by virtue of his/
her/its office and upon the delivery to his/her/its successor or
successors in office of all books, papers, documents or other official
things held in right of his/her/its office. Each such bond shall be taken in
the name of the Borough, and shall be for the use of the Borough
appointing the officer, and for the use of such other person or persons
for whom money shall be collected or received, or as his, her or its
interest shall otherwise appear, in case of a breach of any of the
conditions thereof by the acts or neglect of the principal of the bond.
§ 324-61 TAXATION § 324-62
324:409
The Borough, or any person, may sue upon the said bond in his, her or
its own name for his, her or its own use. Each such bond shall contain
the name or names of the surety company or companies bound thereon.
The Borough shall fix the amount of the bond at an amount equal to the
maximum amount of taxes which may be in the possession of the officer
at any given time. The Borough may at any time, upon cause shown and
due notice to the officer, and his/her/its surety or sureties, require or
allow the substitution or the addition of a surety company acceptable to
the Borough for the purpose of making the bond sufficient in amount,
without releasing the surety or sureties first approved from any accrued
liability or previous action on such bond. The Borough shall designate
the custodian of the bond required to be given by the officer.
D. The officer charged with the administration and enforcement of the
provisions of this article is hereby empowered to prescribe, adopt,
promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter
pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this article,
including provisions for the reexamination and correction of
declarations and returns, and of payments alleged or found to be
incorrect, or as to which any overpayment is claimed or found to have
occurred, and to make refunds in case of overpayment, for any period of
time not to exceed six years subsequent to the date of payment of the
sum involved, and to prescribe forms necessary for the administration
of this article. No rule or regulation of any kind shall be enforceable
unless it has been approved, by ordinance or resolution, by Borough
Council. A copy of such rules and regulations currently in force shall be
available for public inspection.

income tax paid on the taxpayer's ordinary and necessary business
expenses to the extent that such expenses are not paid by the

examine the books, papers and records of any employer or of any
taxpayer or of any person whom the officer reasonably believes to be an
employer or taxpayer, in order to verify the accuracy of any declaration
or return, or if no declaration or return was filed, to ascertain the tax
due. Every employer and every taxpayer and every person whom the
officer reasonably believes to be an employer or taxpayer, is hereby
directed and required to give to the officer, or to any agent designated
by him/her/it, the means, facilities and opportunities for such
examination and investigation as hereby authorized. The officer shall
have such power to subpoena books, records and papers of the
employer or taxpayer as may be found in authority of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
G. Any information gained by the officer, his/her/its agents, or by any other
official or agent of the Borough as a result of any declarations, returns,
investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by this
article, shall be confidential, except for official purposes and except in

due and unpaid under this article.
B. Any suit brought to recover the tax imposed by this article shall be
instituted within three years after such tax is due, or within three years

provided, however, that this limitation shall not prevent the institution
of a suit for the collection of any tax due or determined to be due in the
following cases:
(1) Where no declaration or return was filed by any person although a
declaration or return was required to be filed by him/her/it under
the provisions of this article, there shall be no limitation.
(2) Where an examination of the declaration or return filed by any
person, or of other evidence relating to such declaration or return
in the possession of the officer, reveals a fraudulent evasion of
taxes, there shall be no limitation.
(3) In the case of substantial understatement of tax liability of 25% or
more and no fraud, suit shall be instituted within six years.
(4) Where any person has deducted taxes under the provisions of this
article and has failed to pay the amounts so deducted to the officer,
or where any person has willfully failed or omitted to make the
deductions required by this article, there shall be no limitation.
(5) This section shall not be construed to limit Borough Council from
recovering delinquent taxes by any other means provided by the
Act.
C. The officer may sue for recovery of an erroneous refund, provided such
suit is instituted within two years after making such refund, except that
the suit may be brought within five years if it appears that any part of
the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of material fact.
A. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
per annum on the amount of said tax, and an additional penalty of 1/2%
of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof

ordinance or resolution, establish a one-time period during which
interest or interest and penalties that would otherwise be imposed for
the nonreporting or underreporting of earned income taxes previously
imposed and due shall be waived in total or in part if the taxpayer
voluntarily files delinquent returns and pays the taxes in full during the
period so established. If the Borough establishes such one-time period,
it shall also adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this
subsection.
C. The provisions of Subsection B shall not affect or terminate any
petitions, investigations, prosecutions or other proceedings pending
under the provisions of this article, or prevent the commencement or
further prosecution of any proceedings by the proper authorities for
violations of this article. No proceedings shall, however, be commenced
on the basis of delinquent returns filed pursuant to Subsection B if the
returns are determined to be substantially true and correct and the
taxes are paid in full within the prescribed time.
A. Any person who fails, neglects or refuses to make any declaration or
return required by this article, any employer who fails, neglects or
refuses to deduct or withhold the tax from his/her/its employees, any
person who refuses to permit the officer or any agent designated by
him/her/it to examine his/her/its books, records and papers, and any
person who knowingly makes any incomplete, false or fraudulent
return, or attempts to do anything whatsoever to avoid the full
disclosure of the amount of his/her/its net profits or earned income in

by this article, shall, upon conviction thereof in summary proceeding
before a District Justice or the Court of Common Pleas of Union County,

ARTICLE I
Quality of Life Ticketing
[Adopted 8-16-2016 by Ord. No. 1041]
§ 328-1. General provisions.
§ 328-2. Definitions.
The following words used in this article shall mean as follows:
OWNER  Any person, agent, manager or operator having a legal or
equitable interest in real property or who holds title to the real property
pursuant to a recorded deed or who otherwise has control of the real
property, including, but not limited to, the guardian of the estate of any such
person or the executor or administrator of the estate of such person.
PERSON  An individual, corporation, partnership or any other entity or
association acting as a unit.
VIOLATOR  An owner in violation of any provision of the chapters of the
Code of the Borough or Lewisburg subject to this article as provided in
§ 328-3 hereof.
§ 328-3. Enforcement.
A. This article shall be known and may be cited as the Quality of Life
Ticketing Ordinance of the Borough of Lewisburg.
B. The purpose of this article is to provide for a mechanism for the
issuance of tickets, rather than issuing citations or filing private
criminal complaints for violations, thereby permitting the violator who
believes he/she may have committed a violation to pay the ticket, rather
than causing the issuance of a citation or the filing of a private criminal
complaint, thereby involving the criminal justice system. Resolution of a
violation in this manner is in the best interests of the residents of the
Borough and promotes the safety and welfare of its residents because it
permits the Borough to maintain and enforce its ordinances and laws
and permits a violator to resolve the violation in an expeditious manner
without unduly burdening the violator or the resources of the Borough
by requiring the issuance of a citation or the filing of a private criminal
complaint, thereby involving the criminal justice system, but it does not
deprive the violator of the right to dispute a ticket and pursue his/her
right to procedural and substantive due process of law.
A. The provisions of this article shall be enforced by the Buffalo Valley
Regional Police Department or the Borough's code enforcement officer,
its manager or any other officer thereof so designated.
B. While Borough Council may from time to time by resolution change
those chapters of the Code of the Borough of Lewisburg subject to this
article, at the time of the enactment of this article the following
§ 328-1 TAXATION § 328-3
324:415
§ 328-4. Violation ticket disposition.
A violator in receipt of a violation ticket shall have 10 days within which
time to pay the amount of the ticket. In the event the ticket is not paid
within 10 days, such failure to pay shall result in the issuance of a citation
or the filing of a private criminal complaint for the violation as enumerated
on the ticket and as provided in the chapters of the Code of the Borough of
Lewisburg subject to this article.
chapters are hereby deemed to be subject to this article and the
ticketing process set forth herein:
(1) Chapter 125 entitled Burning, Open.
(2) Chapter 152 regarding the Codes of the Borough, including the
Electrical, Fire Prevention, Plumbing, Building and Property
Maintenance Codes.
(3) Chapter 182 entitled Grass, Weeds and Other Vegetation.
(4) Chapter 235 entitled Peddling and Soliciting.
(5) Chapter 280 entitled Solid Waste.
(6) Chapter 300 entitled Streets and Sidewalks.
(7) Chapter 332 entitled Trees.
C. A violation of any of the provisions of the chapters of the Code of the
Borough of Lewisburg subject to this article may be cause for a
violation ticket, which also may be in the form of a notice of violation, to
be issued to the violator.
D. A violation ticket (or notice of violation) shall be served upon the
violator by any of the following means:
(1) Handing it to the violator;
(2) Handing it to an adult resident of the real property where the
violation exists or occurred;
(3) Leaving or affixing it to the real property where the violation exists
or occurred; or
(4) Mailing it to the violator's address of record by first class mail with
a certificate of mailing.
E. Each day after the issuance of a violation ticket that a violation
continues or is permitted to continue constitutes a separate offense for
which a separate fine may be imposed.
F. If the Borough has corrected, or caused the correction of, a violation,
the cost thereof shall be charged to the violator and collected by
whatever means is available to the Borough.
§ 328-3 LEWISBURG CODE § 328-5
324:416
§ 328-5. Fines and penalties.
A. For the first violation of this article within a twelve-month period, the
fine for the issued ticket shall be $25.
B. For the second violation of this article within a twelve-month period, the
fine for the issued ticket shall be $50.
C. For the third violation of this article within a twelve-month period, the
fine for the issued ticket shall be $100.
D. For the fourth and all subsequent violations of this article within a
twelve-month period, the fine for the issued ticket shall be $300.

immediately preceding the time of the meeting. The notice shall specify in

8-16-1978 by Ord. No. 78-13]
The cost of planting, transplanting, or removing any shade tree in and
along the public highways, of the necessary and suitable guards, curbing, or
grading for the protection thereof, and of the replacing of any pavement or
sidewalk necessarily disturbed in the execution of such work shall be paid
by the owner of the real estate abutting which the work is done. The amount

regulations.
A. Words and phrases, when used in this chapter, except for sections or

meanings ascribed to them in the Vehicle Code (the Act of June 17,
1976, P.L. 162 No. 81), as amended, except that, in this chapter, the
word "street" may be used interchangeably with the word "highway",
and shall have the same meaning as the word "highway" as defined in
the Vehicle Code.
B. The term "legal holidays" as used in this chapter shall mean and
include: New Year's Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence
Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and all Wednesday
afternoons and Sundays.
C. In this chapter, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall
include the singular, and the masculine shall include the feminine.
D. Although the streets in the Borough run generally in a north-south and
a west-east direction, for the purpose of this chapter, Third Street and
the streets running parallel or generally parallel to Third Street shall be
deemed to run in a north-south direction, and Market Street and the
streets parallel or generally parallel to Market Street shall be deemed
to run in an east-west direction.
50.Editor's Note: At the time of the revision of July 21, 1998, the spelling of "St. Catherine
Street" changed to "St. Catharine Street," at the request of the Borough. All prior
enactments adopted as "St. Catherine Street." However, for purposes of historical

10 days after receipt of such notice and to also pay an
administrative charge in the amount of $40. Whenever, in the
judgment of the designated official, it shall appear to be
impracticable to give the aforesaid notice, either because the

police officer, of the Borough designated thereby for this purpose,
may give such notice by posting conspicuously on the property
whereon a vehicle is parked or stored in violation of the provisions

requirements of § 345-27B(2) of this article within 10 days after the
posting of the said notice and to also pay an administrative charge
in the amount of $40. If any owner shall neglect, fail or refuse to
comply with the aforesaid notice and/or to pay the aforesaid
administrative charge within the required period of time, such

article and shall be cited and prosecuted by the Borough, or any
officer or employee, including Buffalo Valley Regional Police
Department police officer, of the Borough designated thereby for
this purpose, as provided in the first sentence of § 345-34 of this
article. [Amended 4-17-2012 by Ord. No. 1014]

§ 345-33. Residential permit parking.
A. Findings and purpose: The Borough finds that:
(1) Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parkings, therefore depriving the residents of those areas
of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
(2) Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
(3) The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Borough considers it to be in the interest of
the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to insure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
B. Definitions: For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area;
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address;
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address;
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
C. Criteria: The residential areas designated in Subsection D of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
(1) During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking
§ 345-32 LEWISBURG CODE § 345-33
324:450
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
(2) During the same period as specified in Subsection C(1), directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person
residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and
Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
(3) Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as impacted
and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a
residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
(a) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(b) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Borough;
(c) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(d) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(e) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and
(f) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
D. Designation of residential permit parking areas:
(1) The following are designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
(2) Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
E. Application for permit: Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Police Chief of the Buffalo Valley Regional Police
Department by the person desiring the permit, who shall be only the
owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a proprietor
of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location within a
residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
§ 345-33 TAXATION § 345-33
324:451
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be
accompanied by a $10 permit fee, which shall be for the use of the
Borough, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential
permit parking program. Each application shall contain the following
information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be,
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as
the case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor
vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Police Chief of the Buffalo
Valley Regional Police Department, the applicant shall be required, at
the time of making application, to present his driver's license and the
vehicle registration card. [Amended 4-17-2012 by Ord. No. 1014]
F. Issuance of permit: Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
Police Chief of the Buffalo Valley Regional Police Department shall issue
to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid for
the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial
and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking
area number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable
annually before the expiration date, upon making application for
renewal and payment of the $10 permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a
violation of this section for any person to display other than the current
and valid permit while standing or parking in a residential permit
parking area at any time when those permits are to be displayed.
[Amended 4-17-2012 by Ord. No. 1014]
G. Temporary and exemption parking permits: Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Police Chief of the Buffalo Valley Regional Police

so parked, that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible
through the windshield of the vehicle. [Amended 4-17-2012 by
Ord. No. 1012]
(2) A parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or park a
motor vehicle in any place where, or at any time when, stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for
other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its
holder from the observance of any traffic or parking regulation
other than such regulation or restriction which is in conflict with
the provisions of this section.
(3) It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person to falsely
represent himself or herself as eligible for a parking permit or to

compliance with the current applicable technical, safety and
safety-related codes, including, but not limited to, the most
recent editions of the American National Standard Institute
(ANSI) Code, National Electrical Safety Code and National
Electrical Code, as well as the accepted and responsible
workmanlike industry practices of the National Association of
Tower Erectors. Towers shall at all times be kept and
maintained in good condition, order and repair by qualified
maintenance and construction personnel, so that the same
§ 360-21 TAXATION § 360-21
324:543
shall not endanger the life of any person or any property in the
Borough.
(b) Notice. Upon submission of an application for a tower and the
scheduling of the public hearing upon the application, the
applicant shall mail notice to all owners of every property
within 500 feet of the proposed facility. The applicant shall
provide proof of such notification to the Borough.
(c) Conditional use authorization required. Towers are permitted
by conditional use in certain areas, at a height necessary to
satisfy their function in the applicant's wireless broadcast
transmission system. No applicant shall have the right under
these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum height
specified in this section unless it proves the necessity for such
height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the Tower is the
minimum height necessary for the service area.
[1] Prior to Borough Council's approval of a conditional use
authorizing the construction and installation of a tower, it
shall be incumbent upon the applicant for such conditional
use approval to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of
Borough Council that the applicant cannot adequately
extend or infill its broadcast transmission system by the
use of equipment, such as redoes, repeaters, antennas and
other similar equipment, installed on existing structures,
such as utility poles or their appurtenances and other
available tall structures. The applicant shall further
demonstrate that the proposed tower must be located
where it is proposed in order to serve the applicant's
service area and that no other viable alternative location
exists.
[2] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed
tower or other communication facilities and related
equipment, a description of the type and manufacturer of
the proposed transmission/radio equipment, the frequency
range (megahertz band) assigned to the applicant, the
power in watts at which the applicant transmits, and any
relevant related tests conducted by the applicant in
determining the need for the proposed site and
installation.
[3] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower
complies with all state and federal laws and regulations
concerning aviation safety.
[4] Where the tower is located on a property with another
principal use, the applicant shall present documentation to
§ 360-21 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-21
324:544
Borough Council that the owner of the property has
granted an easement for the proposed tower and that
vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
[5] The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower
complies with all applicable provisions in this section.
(d) Engineer inspection. Prior to the Borough's issuance of a
permit authorizing construction and erection of a tower, a
structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall issue to
the Borough a written certification of the proposed tower's
ability to meet the structural standards offered by either the
Electronic Industries Association or the Telecommunication
Industry Association and certify the proper construction of the
foundation and the erection of the structure. This certification
shall be provided during the conditional use hearing, or at a
minimum, be made as a condition attached to any approval
given that such certification be provided prior to issuance of
any building permits.
(e) Visual appearance and design. Towers shall employ stealth
technology, which may include the tower portion to be painted
silver or another color approved by Borough Council. All
towers and related equipment shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment
and shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the
existing surroundings and neighboring buildings to the
greatest extent possible. Application of the stealth technology
chosen by the applicant shall be approved by Borough Council.
(f) Co-location and siting. An application for a new tower shall
demonstrate that the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved structure or
building, or sited on land owned and maintained by the
Borough. Borough Council may deny an application to
construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount a broadcast transmission antenna on an
existing structure. The applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings and Towers
within a one-quarter mile radius of the site proposed, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings
and towers, and was denied for one of the following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower;
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure or tower
§ 360-21 TAXATION § 360-21
324:545
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost; or
[3] Such existing buildings, structures or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function, or a commercially
reasonable agreement could not be reached with the
owner of such building, structure or tower.
(g) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible
under applicable state and federal law, any applicant proposing
the modification of an existing tower, which increases the
overall height of such tower, shall first obtain a building permit
from the Borough. Nonroutine modifications that do not fall
under the WBCA or the FCC's October 2014 Report & Order
shall be prohibited without such permit.
(h) Gap in coverage or deficiency in capacity. An application for a
tower must demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless
coverage or deficiency in capacity exists in the applicable area,
and that the type of broadcast transmission facility being
proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill such gap.
The existence or nonexistence of a gap in wireless coverage or
deficiency in capacity shall be a factor in the Borough's
decision on an application for approval of a tower.
(i) Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all towers,
the applicant shall provide the Borough with a written
commitment that it will allow other service providers to
collocate antennas on its tower where technically and
economically feasible. The owner of a tower shall not install
any additional antennas without obtaining the prior written
approval of the Borough.
(j) Wind. Tower structures shall be designed to withstand the
effects of wind gusts of at least 100 miles per hour in addition
to the standard designed by the American National Standards
Institute as prepared by the engineering departments of the
Electronics Industry Association and the Telecommunications
Transmission Industry Association (ANSI/EIA/TIA-222), as
amended.
(k) Height. The maximum height of any tower outside the public
rights-of-way shall not exceed 150 feet.
(l) Related equipment. Related equipment shall either be housed
in an equipment building not to exceed 500 square feet, or on a
pad not to exceed 20 feet by 10 feet, unless the applicant can
otherwise prove to the satisfaction of Borough Council that its
proposed tower necessitates a larger area for equipment
storage purposes.
§ 360-21 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-21
324:546
(m) Public safety communications. No tower shall interfere with
public safety communications or the reception of broadband,
television, radio or other communication services enjoyed by
occupants of nearby properties.

recognized by the Borough as an historic structure.
(q) Signs. All towers shall post a sign in a readily visible location
identifying the name and phone number of a party to contact in
the event of an emergency. The only other signage permitted
on the Tower shall be those required by the FCC, or any other
federal or state agency.
(r) Lighting. No tower shall be artificially lighted, except as
required by law. If lighting is required, the applicant shall
provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting, demonstrating as
unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under
state and federal regulations. The Applicant shall promptly
report any outage or malfunction of FAA-mandated lighting to
the appropriate governmental authorities.
(s) Noise. A tower shall be operated and maintained so as not to
produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
state law and the Borough Code, except in emergency
situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where such
noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only.
(t) Aviation safety. Towers shall comply with all federal and state
laws and regulations concerning aviation safety.
(u) Retention of experts. The Borough may hire any consultant
and/or expert necessary to assist the Borough in reviewing and

Supplemental Regulations
§ 360-23. General supplemental requirements.
These supplemental regulations shall apply in all districts except where
otherwise specified herein. Compliance with these regulations is the
responsibility of the applicant, subject to verification by the Zoning Officer.
A. Visibility at intersections. No obstruction to vision (except street signs,
utility poles or traffic signs approved by the Borough, and existing
buildings, posts, columns or trees) shall be erected, placed, planted or
allowed to grow in a manner that would impede vision between a height
of 36 inches and eight feet above the grades of the intersecting streets.
This area of unobstructed vision (i.e., clear sight triangle) shall be
determined by lines of sight between points that are a certain distance
(as specified in Table 360-23A) from the center point of the intersection
along the center line of both intersecting streets (see example in Figure
360-23A). Distance from the street intersection shall be determined as
follows:

D. Corner lot restriction. On all corner lots there shall be provided the
minimum front yard setback, and a minimum of 150% of the required
side yard setback for the Zoning District in which the corner lot is
situated.
E. Lots in two or more districts. Where a district boundary line(s) divides
any lot in single or joint ownership at the time such line is established,
the more restrictive district regulations shall apply.
F. Lot area and lot width for lots not served with public water and/or
sanitary sewers. Any lot not served by a public water supply and/or
sanitary sewer system, and where municipal, county, state or federal
regulations require a higher standard for lot area or lot width than is
provided for in this chapter, shall be subject to the more restrictive
standards.
G. Right-of-way line. For purposes of measuring front yard setback
requirements, the right-of-way line shall be established by actual deed
or plan description. If no deed or plan description exists, said right-of-
§ 360-23 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-23
324:568
way line shall be established in all districts at a distance of 25 feet from
the center line of the road or street or 1/2 of the road or street right-ofway,
whichever is greater.
H. Through lots. Where a lot extends from a street to an alley, the property
shall be deemed to front upon the street. Where a single lot under
individual or joint ownership extends from one public street to another
parallel or nearly parallel public street, the front lot line shall be
identified by the official U.S. postal address of any structure on the lot.
I. Changes to conforming uses or buildings. Any conforming use or
building may be repaired, maintained, restored or rebuilt to the same

§ 360-26. Off-street parking and loading areas.
The purpose of this section is to reduce traffic congestion on public streets
by requiring that all new development activities provide off-street parking
and loading areas. The following regulations are intended to guide the
design of more efficient off-street parking facilities and load areas, to
improve emergency access, to minimize development problems with
neighboring uses and to provide for special parking needs for handicapped
drivers, bicycles and motorcycles.

ARTICLE VI
Floodplain Management
§ 360-33. Interpretation.
The provisions in this article are based on the Pennsylvania Floodplain
Management Act (Act 166 of 1978), the National Flood Insurance Act of
1968, Section 1361, and the National Flood Insurance Program Section
60.3(d), 44 CFR 59, and have been designed to satisfy state and federal
floodplain management requirements and to provide protection from flood
hazards. In any conflict between the provisions herein and those of the
aforementioned acts and programs, whichever is more restrictive shall
prevail.
§ 360-34. General.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of
property and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the
disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary
and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and
relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
(1) Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies;
(2) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding;
(3) Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur
in flood-prone areas to be elevated and/or floodproofed against
flooding and flood damage.
B. Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the Borough's Zoning Ordinance that are identified as
being subject to the one-hundred-year flood as shown on the maps
prepared for the Borough by the Federal Insurance Administration.
C. Coordination with the Uniform Construction Code. The standards and
specifications contained in the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction
Code, PA Act 45 of 1999, and 34 Pa. Code Chapters 401 through 405, as
from time to time reauthorized and amended, shall apply to activities
regulated under this section to the extent they are more restrictive and/
or supplement the requirements of this chapter.
D. Warning and liability disclaimer. The degree of flood protection sought
by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes, and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study.
Larger floods may occur; flood heights may increase due to man-made
or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any identified
§ 360-33 TAXATION § 360-34
324:613
§ 360-35. Identification of floodplain areas.
floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will
be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the Borough or any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administration decision lawfully made thereunder.
E. Flood boundary interpretation. Where interpretation is needed
concerning the exact location of any boundary of any floodplain, the
Zoning Officer shall make the initial determination. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall make final determinations. The person questioning or
contesting the location of the boundary and/or the Zoning Officer's
decision shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her case
to the Zoning Hearing Board and to submit his/her own technical
evidence if he/she so desires.
A. For the purpose of this chapter, floodplain areas within the Borough
shall be those areas identified as being subject to the one-hundred-year
flood, as designated in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the
Borough of Lewisburg by the Federal Insurance Administration, dated
September 28, 2007, or the most recent revision thereof. A map
showing all areas considered to be subject to the one-hundred-year
flood is available for inspection at the Lewisburg Borough Building, 55
South Fifth Street, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
(1) This Floodplain District shall be an overlay to the existing
underlying zoning districts as shown on the official Zoning Map. As
such, the provisions for this district shall serve as a supplement to
the underlying district provisions. Where there happens to be any
conflict between the provision or requirements for the Floodplain
District and those of any underlying district, the more restrictive
provisions pertaining to the floodplain shall apply.
B. Description of Floodplain District areas. For the purposes of this article,
the following nomenclature is used in referring to the various floodplain
areas:
(1) FW (floodway area): The areas identified as "floodway." The FW
(floodway area) shall include that portion of the floodplain area
required to carry and discharge the waters of the one-hundred-year
flood. The channel of the watercourse and portions of the adjoining
floodplains reasonably required to carry and discharge the onehundred-
year frequency flood. Unless otherwise specified, the
boundary of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood
insurance studies provided by FEMA, dated September 28, 2007,
or the most recent revision thereof. In an area where no FEMA
maps or studies have defined the boundary of the one-hundred-year
frequency floodway, it is assumed, absent evidence to the contrary,
that the floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of
the bank of the stream.
§ 360-34 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-35
324:614
§ 360-36. Permits.
(2) FF (flood fringe area): The areas identified as "flood fringe." The FF
(flood fringe area) shall include that portion of the one-hundredyear
floodplain not included in the floodway. The basis for the
outermost boundary of this area shall be the one-hundred-year
flood elevation contained in the flood profiles of the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying maps.
C. Changes in floodplain area delineations. The identified floodplain area
may be revised or modified by the Borough Council upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission and Borough Engineer,
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
document the need or possibility for such revision. No modification or
revision of any floodplain area identified in the FIS shall be made
without prior approval from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA).
D. Disputes. Should a dispute arise concerning the identification of any
floodplain area or boundary, an initial determination shall be made by
the Zoning Officer. Any party aggrieved by such decision or
interpretation may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, which shall
have jurisdiction to issue a final determination. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.
A. Issuance of zoning and building permit. Prior to the issuance of permits
for any activities regulated under this section, the Zoning Officer shall
review the application to determine if all other necessary governmental
permits or approvals required by state and federal laws have been
obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities
Act, P.L. 1535, No. 537, January 24, 1966, P.S. § 750.1 et seq., as
hereafter amended, supplemented, modified or reenacted by the
General Assembly of Pennsylvania; the Dam Safety and Encroachments
Act, P.L. 1375, No. 325, November 26, 1978, 32 P.S. § 693.1 et seq., as

404, 33 U.S.C. § 1334; and the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act, P.L.
1987, No. 394, June 22, 1937, 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq., as hereafter
amended, supplemented, modified or reenacted by the General
Assembly of Pennsylvania. No permit shall be issued until this
determination has been made.

considered provisional until 30 days after the use is fully
operational and there has been a determination that such
standards have been met.
(a) The applicant shall submit documentation of compliance with
all relevant performance standards, as requested by the
Zoning Officer.
(b) Upon completion of the 30 days, if the use is in compliance

met within 90 days after the start of operation of said use, the

proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building,
structure, sign, landscaping or land use, or to prevent, in or about such
premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation.

A. Standards and criteria for variances.
(1) The Board shall, by rule, prescribe the form of application and may
require the submission of a preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer.
(2) The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case.
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size
and shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances created by the provisions of this chapter in the
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(e) That the variance will represent the minimum variance that
will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
(f) That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district, and no permitted or
nonconforming use of land, structure or buildings in other
districts, shall be considered grounds for the granting of any
variance.
§ 360-44 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-45
324:640
(g) That in no case shall a variance be granted solely for reasons of
financial hardship or additional financial gain on the part of the
applicant.
(3) When applications for a variance within any identified floodplain
area are being considered, the following provisions also apply:
(a) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and that the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(b) Variances may not be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any floodway area that
would result in any increase in flood levels during a onehundred-
year flood, as certified by a professional engineer
retained by the applicant and verified by the Borough
Engineer.
(c) Except for a possible modification of the one-and-one-half-foot
freeboard requirement involved, no variance shall be granted
for any of the other requirements pertaining specifically to
§ 360-37F.
(d) In reviewing any request for a variance, the Board shall
consider that there is a good and sufficient cause; that failure
to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and that the granting of the variance will neither
result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood
heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary
public expense nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimize the public or conflict with any other applicable state
or local ordinances or regulations.
(e) If a variance from the floodplain management requirements is
granted, the Board shall notify the applicant in writing that the
erection, construction, development, alteration, extension, use
or activity for which the variance is being granted may result
in:
[1] Increased premium rates for flood insurance.
[2] Increased risk to life and property.
(f) Notwithstanding any of the above, all structures shall be
designed and constructed so as to have the capability of
resisting a one-hundred-year flood, as certified by a
professional engineer retained by the applicant and verified by
the Borough Engineer.

conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare, and to achieve the purposes of
this chapter.
(5) All applications for variances shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review and recommendation before application for
a hearing is submitted. Lack of recommendation by the Planning
Commission shall be deemed as recommended approval of the

be maintained by the Borough. In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year with regard to Article VI, Floodplain
Management, shall be included in the annual report to FEMA.

Ordinance, the special exception use shall not be granted until such
time as the variance may be authorized.

has been discontinued and/or not verifiably marketed for a period
of one year, such use shall thereafter revert to permitted uses of the

been discontinued and/or not verifiably marketed for a period of
one year, such use shall thereafter revert to permitted uses of the
applicable zoning district.

chapter.
(3) Where the Board fails to render the decision within the required

§ 360-50. Nonconforming lots, uses, structures and buildings.
B. The schedule of fees shall be available for inspection in the office of the
Zoning Officer and no action shall be taken on any application or appeal
until such time as all fees, charges and expenses have been paid in full.
C. The schedule of fees may be altered or amended by resolution of
Borough Council.
A. Statement of intent. Within the zoning districts established pursuant to
this chapter or subsequent amendments thereto, there exist or will
exist certain nonconformities that, if lawful before this chapter was
enacted or amended, may be continued, subject to certain limitations,
although such nonconformities would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or subsequent amendments
thereto. In order to avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated
use of any buildings or structures on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment to
this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently carried on.
B. Nonconforming lots of record.
(1) Undeveloped lots of record existing at the date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that do not conform to the regulations
of the Zoning District in which they are located may be used for
primary structures or dwellings and accessory uses upon
application for and approval by the Zoning Hearing Board of a
special exception. In granting such a special exception, the Zoning
Hearing Board should specify setback requirements that
approximate the predominant setback of the developed lots on the
block.
(2) If two or more undeveloped lots, or combinations of undeveloped
lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership, are of record at the time of adoption of this chapter or
amendment thereto, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and/or area, the land shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this
chapter. No portion of said parcel shall be developed or sold in a
manner that diminishes compliance with lot width and/or area
requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made that creates a lot with width or area below the
minimum requirements established in this chapter.
C. Nonconforming uses.
(1) The lawful use of land or a building or structure that at the effective
date of this chapter or as a result of subsequent amendments
thereto does not conform to the use requirements contained
§ 360-49 TAXATION § 360-50
324:651
therein may be continued by the present or any subsequent owner
so long as such use remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
(a) Whenever a nonconforming use of any land, structure or
building has been discontinued and/or not verifiably marketed
for a period of one year, such land, structure or building or any
portion thereof shall thereafter be used only in a manner in full
compliance with this chapter.
(b) Voluntary removal or destruction of the structure or building in
which any nonconforming use is located shall eliminate the use
of the land upon which the structure or building was erected
for such nonconforming use. "Destruction," for the purpose of
this subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of 75% or
more of the market value of said structure or building
immediately prior to such damage or destruction as appraised
for tax assessment purposes utilizing the State Tax
Equalization Board (STEB) report. The determination of the
extent of damage in terms of percent replacement value due to
damage or destruction shall be made by comparing estimates
made by two certified appraisers appointed by the Borough
and the insurance adjuster's estimate of repair cost. The cost
of such appraisals shall be borne by the property owner of the
affected property.
(c) Should the structure or building in which any nonconforming
use is located be destroyed by fire, flood, wind or other means
not of the owner's decision, the nonconforming use may be
continued in the reconstructed structure or building, but the
structure or building shall not be reconstructed in any manner
that increases the use's nonconformity, except as provided in
§ 360-50D(2). If reconstruction has not commenced within one
year of the date of such destruction, reconstruction and
subsequent use shall be in full compliance with this chapter
and all other applicable regulations.
(2) A nonconforming use may be altered or expanded upon application
for and approval by the Zoning Hearing Board of a special
exception provided that the following conditions are met:
(a) Expansion of the nonconformity shall be confined to the lot on
which it is located on the effective date of this chapter or any
amendment thereto creating the nonconformity.
(b) Extension of any nonconforming use shall be permitted only
once and shall not exceed 25% of the gross floor area of any
building or, if an outdoor use, 25% of the gross land area
occupied by said nonconforming use at the time of the adoption
and/or amendment of this chapter.
§ 360-50 LEWISBURG CODE § 360-50
324:652
(c) Provision for building height, building area and impervious
surface shall be consistent with the standards required for any
permitted structure or building in the zone in which the
nonconformity in question is located; however, the existing
nonconforming setback may be continued or extended but not
increased.
(3) Any nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, shall not
thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use.
(4) A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use upon application for and approval by the Zoning Hearing Board
of a special exception provided that the Zoning Hearing Board shall
find that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate in the
Zoning District in which the use is located than the existing
nonconforming use and that the proposed use will have no more
adverse effect on adjacent properties than the existing
nonconforming use in relation to signs and lighting, traffic
generation and movement, parking and loading, and any applicable
performance standards.
D. Nonconforming structures or buildings.
(1) Structures or buildings that at the effective date of this chapter or
subsequent amendments thereto do not conform to the
requirements contained therein by reason of restrictions on area,
maximum impervious coverage, height, setbacks, location on the
lot or other requirements concerning the building or structure may
be continued to be used, maintained and repaired so long as such
structure or building remains otherwise lawful. However, no
nonconforming structure or building shall be for any reason moved
any distance unless it shall thereafter conform to the zoning
regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(2) A nonconforming building or structure may be altered or expanded
subject to the following provisions:
(a) Such alteration or expansion is confined to the lot on which the
nonconforming structure is located on the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto creating the nonconformity.
(b) Such alteration or expansion does not create other or
additional nonconformities or further increase existing
nonconformities, although nonconforming setbacks may be
continued or extended.
(c) Such alteration or expansion is in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter or only extends any existing
nonconformity relative to a setback or setbacks and does not
enlarge said nonconformity. (An example is if a landowner
proposes enlarging his residence along the existing front
§ 360-50 TAXATION § 360-50
324:653
building line which is set back two feet less than the required
20 feet).
(3) There may be additions or improvements to dimensional
nonconformities upon application for and approval of a special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board provided that the following
conditions are met:
(a) Such addition or improvement is confined to the lot on which
the nonconforming structure is located on the effective date of
this chapter or any amendment thereto creating the
nonconformity.
(b) The addition or improvement shall not create other or
additional nonconformities.
(c) Appearance is harmonious with surrounding properties.
(d) Landscaping and buffer yards in accordance with applicable
requirements should be provided to protect neighboring
properties.
(4) Should a nonconforming structure or building be destroyed by fire,
flood, wind or other means not of the owner's decision, it shall not
be reconstructed in any manner that increases its nonconformity. If
reconstruction has not commenced within one year of the date of
such destruction, reconstruction shall be in full compliance with
this chapter and all other applicable regulations.
(5) In cases where two or more uses or principal structures, exclusive
of any accessory structures, exist on a single parcel, all such
buildings or uses shall comply with all requirements of this chapter
and subsequent amendments that would normally apply to each
building or use if each were on a separate lot. In cases where
existing multiple uses and/or primary buildings are nonconforming,
any alterations or modifications shall be consistent with § 360-50B
and C of this chapter.
E. Registration of nonconformities. To facilitate the administration of this
chapter, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to prepare and
maintain an accurate listing of all nonconforming uses and structures in
all districts. As far as records make possible, any previous permitted
extensions of any nonconforming uses should be noted in the listing of
those uses. The listing of nonconformities shall be a matter of public
record.
(1) Uses permitted by right, special exception, conditional use and/or
variance shall be so noted on a permanent record of the subject
parcel.
