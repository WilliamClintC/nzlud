BOARDMAN MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Boardman, Oregon 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
  
    The Boardman, Oregon Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 2001, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Rex Mather, city manager. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 3-2016, passed December 6, 2016, and considered for inclusion.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

Operators engaged in business at the time this chapter is adopted must register not later than thirty (30) calendar days after passage of this chapter. Operators staring business after this chapter is adopted must register within fifteen (15) calendar days after commencing business.

Registration shall set forth the name under which an operator transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his or her place or places of business and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the tax administrator may require. The registration shall be signed by the operator. The tax administrator shall, within ten (10) days after registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for such additional place of business for each registrant. Certificates shall be non-assignable and non-transferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the tax administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer. Each certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable and shall be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy.

3.04.080 - Due date-Returns and payments. 
A.	The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient to the operator at the time that rent is paid.

Such taxes are due on the last day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter. 
B.	Prior to the end of the month following the end of each calendar quarter of collection a return for that quarter's tax shall be filed with the tax administrator. The return shall be filed in such form as the tax administrator may prescribe by every operator liable for payment of tax.

The tax administrator may require returns to show the total rentals upon which tax was collected or otherwise due, and an explanation in detail of any discrepancy between reported rentals and amounts tendered, the amount of rents exempt, if any, and a description of units rented for more than thirty (30) days. 
D.	The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the remittance of the amount of tax due, to the tax administrator at his office either by personal delivery or by mail. If the return is mailed, the postmark shall be considered the date of delivery for determining penalties.

C.	If a qualified public improvement is located in whole or in part on or contiguous to the property that is the subject of development approval and is required to be built larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the particular development project, a credit shall be given for the cost of the portion of the improvement that exceeds the city's minimum standard facility size or capacity needed to serve the particular development project or property.

The request for credit shall be filed in writing no later than sixty (60) days after acceptance of the improvement by the city. 
D.	When the construction of a qualified public improvement located in whole or in part or contiguous to the property that is the subject of development approval gives rise to a credit amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be levied against the project, the credit in excess of the improvement fee for the original development project may be applied against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project. 
E.	Notwithstanding subsection D and this subsection, when establishing a methodology for a system development charge, the city may provide for a credit against the improvement fee, the reimbursement fee, or both, for capital improvements constructed as part of the development which reduce the development's demand upon existing capital improvements and/or the need for future capital improvements, or a credit based upon any other rationale the council finds reasonable. 
F.	Credits shall not be transferable from one development to another. 
G.	Credits shall not be transferable from type of system development charge to another.

    "Recorder" means the auditor, recorder, clerk or other person or officer of the city serving as clerk of the city or performing the clerical work of the city. 
(Prior code § 2-2.1) 
3.12.020 - Property description. 
A.	Real property may be described by giving the subdivision according to the United States survey when coincident with the boundaries thereof; or by lots, blocks and addition names; or by giving the boundaries thereof by metes and bounds; or by reference to the book and page of any public record of the county where the description may be found; or by designation of tax lot number referring to a record kept by the assessor of descriptions of real properties of the county, which record shall constitute a public record; or in such other manner as to cause the description to be made certain. Initial letters, abbreviations, figures, fractions and exponents, to designate the township, range, section, or part of a section; or the number of any lot or block or part thereof; or any distance, course, bearing or direction, may be employed in any such description of real property. 
B.	If the owner of any land is unknown, such land may be assessed to "unknown owner," or "unknown owners." If the property is correctly described, no assessment shall be invalidated by a mistake in the name of the owner of the real property assessed or by the omission of the name of the owner or the entry of a name other than that of the true owner. When the name of the true owner, or the owner of record, of any parcel of real property is given, the assessment shall not be held invalid on account of any error or irregularity in the description if the description would be sufficient in a deed of conveyance from the owner, or is such that, in a suit to enforce a contract to convey, employing such description a court of equity would hold it to be good and sufficient. 
C.	Any description of real property which conforms substantially to the requirements of this section shall be a sufficient description in all proceedings of assessment for a special improvement district, foreclosure and sale of delinquent assessments, and in any other proceeding related to or connected with levying, collecting and enforcing special assessments for special benefits to such property.

A.	To make a survey and written report of the project and file it with the city clerk within thirty (30) days from the date of the resolution, unless the council grants an extension of time. The report shall contain: 
1.	A plat or map showing the general nature, location and extent of the proposed improvement and the lands to be assessed to pay any part of the costs thereof; 
2.	A description of the type of the proposed improvement and an estimate of the length of its useful life;

(Prior code § 2-2.3) 
3.12.050 - Resolution-Notice. 
    If the council declares its intention to make the improvement, it shall in its resolution: 
A.	Direct the city clerk to cause to be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, a notice stating: 
1.	That the council has declared its intention to proceed with the improvement and that the report of the city engineer is on file in the city clerk's office, subject to examination; 
2.	The estimated total cost of the improvement, less the amount thereof to be borne by the city, if any; 
3.	A description of the district to be specially benefited by the improvement; 
4.	That remonstrances may be filed against the proposed improvement at the office of the city clerk not later than five p.m. on the twentieth day after the date of first publication of the notice; 
5.	That the project will be discontinued if a remonstrance of the owners of two-thirds of the benefited property to be specifically affected is filed; 
6.	The date when the engineer's report and any objections thereto will be considered by the council and all interested persons. 
B.	Direct the city clerk to send a notice by mail to his or her last known address to each owner of the various lots, tracts, or parcels of property within the improvement district, which notice shall state:

    If, after hearing the engineer's report and any objections thereto, the council shall find such report to be reasonable and just, it may adopt the same or amend, and as amended, adopt the report by motion. The council may require a supplementary or further report from the city engineer. If after the hearing the council determines that the local improvements shall be made, when the report has been adopted in original form or as amended, the council shall then determine whether or not to proceed with the local improvement. If the council determines that the local improvement shall be made, when the estimated cost thereof is ascertained on the basis of the contract award or city departmental cost, or after the work is done and the cost thereof has been actually determined, the council shall determine whether the property benefited shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The city engineer shall prepare the proposed assessment to the respective lots within the assessment district and file it in the city clerk's office. Notice of such proposed assessments shall be mailed or personally delivered to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed, which notice shall state the amounts of assessment proposed on that property and shall fix a date by which time objections shall be filed with the clerk. Any such objection shall state the grounds thereof. The council shall consider such objections and may adopt, correct, modify or revise the proposed assessments and shall determine the amount of assessment to charge against each lot within the district, according to the special and peculiar benefits accruing thereto from the improvement, and shall by ordinance spread the assessments. 
(Prior code § 2-2.5) 
3.12.070 - Other methods of financing. 
    When in the opinion of the council, on account of topographical or physical conditions, unusual or excessive public travel, or other character of the work involved, or when the council otherwise believes the situation warrants it, it may contribute what it deems a fair proportion of the cost of such improvement from general funds of the city, and the amount to be assessed to the property benefited shall be proportionately reduced. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the council from using other available means of financing improvements, including federal or state grants-in-aid, sewer service or other types of service charges, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds or other legal means of finance. In the event that any of such other means of finance are used, the council may, in its discretion, levy special assessments hereunder to cover any part of the costs of improvement not covered by such means of finance. 
(Prior code § 2-2.6) 
3.12.080 - Manner of work.

The council may let the contract for the doing of the work, if after the hearing, the council determines to continue with the project. The council may provide that the work shall be done by city forces. In the event that the work is done under contract bids shall be received on all such work, the estimated cost of which is more than four thousand dollars ($4,000.00). The contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder, provided that the council shall have the right to reject all bids when they are deemed unreasonable or unsatisfactory, or if the bids are opened at the hearing, when the council shall determine not to proceed with the improvement. The council shall provide for taking security by bond for the faithful performance of any contract under its authority, and the provisions thereof, in case of default, shall be enforced by action in the name of the city. 
(Prior code § 2-2.7) 
3.12.090 - Equitable or legal relief. 
    Subject to curative provisions of Section 3.12.170 and rights of the city to reassess as provided in Section 3.12.190, proceedings for writs of review and other appropriate equitable or legal relief may be filed as provided by state law.

Assessments which are not paid or bonded within the time stated shall bear interest at seven percent per annum beginning with the last day on which assessment is required to be paid. The owner to whom the notice is mailed as required by this section shall be the "owner" as defined in Section 3.12.010 of this chapter. 
(Prior code § 2-2.10) 
3.12.120 - Property ownership determination. 
    For the purpose of ascertaining who is the owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of land or part thereof assessed for the improvements herein described the city clerk may take the certificate of any abstractor, abstract company or person or persons engaged in the searching or examination of titles, who may be designated by the council for such purpose, which certificate shall state who is the record owner or contract purchaser of record of each such lot, parcel, or tract of land or part thereof subject to such assessment on the date the council declared its intention to make the improvement, as shown by the records in the office of the county clerk of Morrow County, Oregon. 
(Prior code § 2-2.11) 
3.12.130 - Deficit assessment. 
    If the assessment is made before the total costs of the improvement are known, and it is found that the amount assessed is insufficient to defray the expenses of the project, the council may by resolution declare such deficit and prepare a proposed deficit assessment. The city clerk shall give notice thereof and of the hearing of objections thereto as herein prescribed with reference to the original report; and the council, upon such hearing, shall make a just and equitable deficit assessment by ordinance. Such deficit assessment shall be consolidated with the assessment in the lien docket. The deficit assessment shall be collected in the same manner as the original assessment. 
(Prior code § 2-2.12) 
3.12.140 - Rebates. 
    If, upon the completion of a project, it is found that any sum theretofore assessed therefor upon any property is more than sufficient to pay the cost of the improvement, the council must ascertain and declare the same by ordinance, and when so declared, it must be entered in the docket of city liens as a credit upon the appropriate assessment. If any such assessment has been paid, the person who paid the same, or his or her legal representative, shall be entitled to the payment of any portion of the rebate credit which exceeds the assessment, by a warrant on the city. 
(Prior code § 2-2.13)

(Prior code § 2-2.15) 
3.12.170 - Errors in procedure. 
    No improvement assessment shall be invalid by reason of a failure to give, in any report, in the proposed assessment, in the ordinance making the assessment, in the lien docket or elsewhere in the proceedings, the name of the owner of any lot, tract or parcel of land or part thereof, or by mistake in the name of any such person or the entry of a name other than the name of such owner, or by reason of any error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity, or other act, jurisdictional or otherwise, in any of the proceedings or steps hereinabove specified, unless it appear that the assessment as made, insofar as it affects the person complaining, is unfair and unjust, and the council shall have power and authority to remedy and correct all such matters by suitable action and proceedings. 
(Prior code § 2-2.16) 
3.12.180 - Foreclosure. 
    The city may proceed to foreclose as delinquent any lien for assessments made under this chapter or made under previous ordinances and charter provisions of the city in the manner and at the time provided in ORS Chapter 223.

(Prior code § 2-2.17) 
3.12.190 - Reassessment. 
    Whenever an assessment, deficit assessment, or reassessment for a local improvement has been set aside, annulled, declared or rendered void, or its enforcement restrained by a court of this state or a federal court having jurisdiction, or when the council doubts the validity of the assessment, deficit assessment, or reassessment, or any part of it, the council may make a new assessment or reassessment in the manner provided by ORS Chapter 223. 
(Prior code § 2-2.18) 
3.12.200 - Time limitation. 
    In the event any improvement project is not defeated by remonstrance, and the council determines to proceed with the work after the hearing, a contract for the doing of the work shall be let, or the work shall be commenced within one year from the date of the hearing. In the event the contract is not let or the work commenced within one year from the date of the hearing, the proceedings undertaken therefor shall be of no force and effect, and any liens docketed or assessments collected shall be cancelled and rebated. Provided, however, that where the council determines, in its best judgment, that it would be advisable to postpone commencement of a portion or portions of the work for a time past the six month period herein provided in order to achieve a more orderly development of the project and to permit construction of the remaining portion or portions when the same can be fully utilized in conjunction with the initial portion of the project, it may so declare in its resolution of intention to construct the improvement. The council shall review the project periodically thereafter and may continue completion of a portion of the project from time to time until in its judgment the city and the persons to be benefited thereby will be best served. Such action shall not be taken by the council unless it shall find that the remaining part of the work which is to be commenced within the six month period, when complete, will be self-sufficient under existing circumstances. Assessments for the portion or portions of the work to be done at a later date may be held in abeyance by the council until the council determines to proceed with the remaining portion or portions of the work. A record of the estimated proposed assessments so held in abeyance shall be recorded in the deed records of Morrow County so as to provide notice to all interested persons that the property to be benefited by completion of the project is subject to further assessment.

If the chief of police continues to recommend designation as a criminal gang affiliate following the first stage hearing, the potential designee may request a second stage hearing before the Boardman city manager or his/her designee which may not be the hearing officer involved in the first stage hearings. A request for a second stage hearing must be made in writing and received by the Boardman city manager, at 200 City Center Circle, Boardman, Oregon 97818 within fourteen (14) calendar days following the date of the first hearing if an oral decision is made at the end of first hearing or within fourteen (14) calendar days following the mailing of a written decision from the first hearing.

The city manager or his/her designee reserves the right to set the time and date of the hearing in the event a mutually convenient time and date cannot be easily accommodated. Hearings at the second stage will be held de novo. At the hearing, the potential designee may present any information that bears on the applicability of the designation criteria, and will be required to provide a current address.

The district attorney will review any information submitted at both hearings and determine, without a hearing, whether gang affiliation designation is supported by clear and convincing evidence and meets the stated criteria in this ordinance. The potential designee will be informed of the decision by letter mailed regular, first class mail to the current address of the potential designee as provided by the potential designee. If the district attorney is to designate, the decision will become effective immediately upon mailing of his/her determination unless the potential designee appeals the determination to the Irrigon Justice Court.

Any relevant evidence shall be admitted. The potential designee shall have the right to present evidence and witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who testify against him or her and to submit rebuttal evidence.

Subsequent bills shall be paid in a similar manner. Failure of the customer to make such deposit shall warrant discontinuance of service, as provided under subsection F of this section of these rules and regulations. 
D.	Failure to Read Meters. In the event that it shall be impossible or impractical to read a meter on the regular reading date, the water bill shall reflect only the minimum service charge. Subsequent billings will only be for the actual consumption above the monthly minimums during the period the meter was not read. 
E.	Payment of Bills. Each bill rendered shall contain the final date on which payment is due. If the bill is not paid by that date, the account shall be considered delinquent unless other arrangements have been made with the city in writing specifying another due date.

The notice shall state that water service will be suspended if the delinquent account is not paid prior to a stated date not less than three business days following the delivery of the notice and shall state that the customer has an opportunity to be heard, prior to the discontinuance, by a city official or employee empowered to resolve any valid objections to the billing. 
3.	Suspension of Service. On the date of suspension of service, the meter reader or other agent of the city shall deliver a written notice to the customer stating that the water service is being turned off until all delinquent amounts have been paid. The meter reader or other agent of the city shall immediately thereafter suspend the service. A delivery to any person residing at the address served by the meter shall be considered a delivery to the customer.

A.	Meter Accuracy. All meters will be tested prior to installation. No meter will be placed in service or allowed to remain in service which is known to have an error in registration in excess of five percent under conditions of normal operation. 
B.	Meter Test. 
1.	Field Testing. A city water department official shall perform several field assessments to determine whether a meter is accurately registering water flow. Testing methods shall include; turning the water off inside the house and to all other uses (i.e. irrigation system) a check for flow by the detector which will indicate whether there is water moving in the system indicating a leak; doing a field flow test from a hose bib with all other fixtures off; 24- or 48-hour field monitoring of meter readings under normal use; and whatever other field investigation deemed appropriate by the superintendent. 
2.	Should the evidence indicate there is probable cause for additional flow testing the meter shall be replaced or field flow tested in accordance with standards established by the American Water Works Association. 
3.	Standard Test. Meter tests will be conducted in accordance with standards of practice established by the American Water Works Association. The city may do this in-house or have an independent contractor perform these tests. 
4.	On Customer Request. A customer may, giving not less than seven days' notice, request the city to test the meter serving his or her premises. The city will require the customer to pay the testing fee. This fee shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for meters one inch and smaller and for meters larger than one inch shall be an estimate of the cost of testing the meter as determined by the superintendent. The charge will be returned to the customer if the test reveals the meter to over-register more than five percent under conditions of normal operation. If the meter is operating satisfactorily or if the meter under-registers more than five percent under the standard test conditions, the charge shall be forfeited to the city. Customers may, at their option, witness any meter tests which they request. 
5.	On City Request. If, upon comparison of past water usage, it appears that a meter is not registering properly, the city may, at its option, test the meter and adjust the charges accordingly if the meter either over-registers or under-registers. No charge for meter testing will be made to the customer for the meter test under these conditions. 
C.	Adjustment of Bills for Meter Error. 
1.	Fast Meters. When, upon test, a meter is found to be registering more than five percent fast under normal operating conditions, the city will refund to the customer the full amount of the overcharge, based on corrected meter readings, not exceeding two regular billing period that the meter was in use. 
2.	Slow Meters. When, upon test, a meter is found to be registering more than five (5) percent slow, the city may bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge, based upon corrected meter readings, not exceeding two regular billing periods that the meter was in use. 
3.	Non-registering Meters. The city will bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The bill will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer's prior use during the same season of the previous year, or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same season and under similar circumstances and conditions, or both.

A.	All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on any federally financed construction projects conducted by the city shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor, regardless of contractual relationship. 
B.	All construction contracts entered into by the city that will be financed with federal assistance, must contain a statement that the contractor/subcontractor agrees to abide with all the regulations in the Davis-Bacon Act. This includes the payment of "prevailing" wages, the posting of these rates on the job site, and filing the proper reports with the Department of Labor. 
C.	The city is responsible for obtaining a copy of the "prevailing" wages for the locality from either the contractor/subcontractor or the Secretary of Labor. The city is also required to obtain a copy of the reports filed with the Department of Labor within seven days after the end of the contractor's pay period. It must be determined that the contractor/subcontractor has paid laborers at least the "prevailing" wage, and that any overtime and fringe benefits have been calculated correctly. 
D.	The city manager is responsible for monitoring this policy and determining the contractors/subcontractors are in compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act. All reports and documentation obtained by the city shall be filed by project. The city is not required to file any reports unless a violation occurs. If violations of this act are found, the responsible official will properly notify the Secretary of Labor on a timely basis.

Chapter 1.0  How to Use the Development Code
Welcome to the Boardman Development Code. This is a comprehensive land use and development code that governs all of the land within the incorporated limits of Boardman. The five chapters of the code are used together to review land use applications. They are organized as follows:
Chapter 1 - In addition to this brief introduction, Chapter 1 provides definitions for selected terms and information on the legal construct of the code. It also explains the Citys authority to enforce the Development Code.
Chapter 2 - Every parcel, lot, and tract of land within the Citys incorporated boundaries is also within a land use district. (Land use districts are shown on the Citys official zoning map.) Chapter 2 identifies the land uses that are permitted within each district, and the standards that apply to each type of land use (e.g., lot standards, setbacks, and use-specific design standards). As required by state law, the zones or land use districts conform to the Boardman Comprehensive Plan. The districts reserve land for planned land uses, provide compatibility between different uses, and implement planned housing densities.
Chapter 3 - The design standards contained in Chapter 3 apply throughout the City. They are used in preparing development plans, and reviewing applications, to ensure compliance with City standards for access and circulation, landscaping, parking, public facilities, surface water management, housing densities, and sensitive lands.
Chapter 4 - Chapter 4 provides all of the application requirements and procedures for obtaining permits required by this code. Four types of permit procedures are covered: Type I (non-discretionary, ministerial decision); Type II (discretionary, administrative decision); Type III (discretionary, administrative decision with public hearing); and Type IV (legislative decision by City Council).
Chapter 5 - Chapter 5 provides standards and procedures for variances and non-conforming situations (i.e., existing uses or developments that do not comply with the code). This code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation. The Citys varied geography, and complexities of land development, require flexibility. Chapter 5 provides that flexibility, while maintaining the purposes and intent of the code.
Chapter 6 - Chapter 6 contains map amendments that have been approved by administrative of legislative action. The District (zoning) map found within Chapter 6 is the official designated zoning map for the City of Boardman.

2.1.140 - Flag Lots and Lots Accessed by Mid-Block Lanes
As shown below, some lots in existing neighborhoods may have standard widths but may be unusually deep compared to other lots in the area. Essentially unused space at the back of a lot may provide room for one or more lots for infill housing. Infill lots may be developed as flag lots or mid-block developments, as defined below:
Figure 2.1.140A  Mid-block Infill
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.1.8
City of Boardman April 23, 2013
2.1.140 - Flag Lots and Lots Accessed by Mid-Block Lanes (continued)
A. Mid-block lanes. Lots may be developed without frontage onto a public street when lot access is provided by a series of mid-block lanes, as shown above. Mid-block lanes shall be required whenever practicable as an alternative to approving flag lots. The lanes shall meet the standards for alleys, per Chapter 3.4.100, and subsections C-F, below.
Figure 2.1.140B - Flag Lot (Typical)
B. Flag lots. Flag lots may be created only when mid-block lanes cannot be extended to serve future development. A flag lot driveway may serve no more than two (2) dwelling units, including accessory dwellings and dwellings on individual lots, unless Uniform Fire Code (UFC) standards are met for more units. When UFC standards are met, the maximum number of dwellings shall be six (6). A drive serving more than one lot shall have a reciprocal access and maintenance easement recorded for all lots. No fence, structure or other obstacle shall be placed within the drive area.
C. Driveway and lane width. The minimum width of all shared drives and lanes shall be 12 feet; the maximum width is 20 feet, except as required by the Uniform Fire Code.
D. Dedication of drive lane. The owner shall dedicate 12 feet of right-of-way or record a 12 foot wide easement (i.e., 6 feet from each property sharing a drive) for vehicle access similar to an alley. Dedication or recording, as applicable, shall be so indicated on the face of the subdivision or partition plat.
E Maximum drive lane length. The maximum drive lane length is subject to requirements of the Uniform Fire Code, but shall not exceed 150 feet for a shared side drive, and 400 feet for a shared rear lane.

2.1.160 - Building Height
Figure 2.1.160 - Building Height Measurement (Composite of Several Roof Forms)
The following building height standards are intended to promote land use compatibility and support the principle of neighborhood-scale design:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the Residential District shall be no more than 35 feet for gabled roofs; 30 foot for flat roofs or 2 ½ stories high, whichever is greater, and buildings within the Multi-family Sub District may be up to 30 feet or 3 stories. Building height may be restricted to less than these maximums when necessary to comply with the Building Height Transition standard in C below. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof equipment, flagpoles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy.
B. Method of Measurement. Building height is measured as the vertical distance above a reference datum measured to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof or to the deck line of a mansard roof or to the average height of the highest gable of a pitched or hipped roof (See above examples). The reference datum shall be selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building:
a. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.1.11
City of Boardman April 23, 2013
2.1.160 - Building Height (continued)
b. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface described in subsection a is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the building.
Figure 2.1.160C - Building Height Transition
C. Building Height Transition. To provide compatible building scale and privacy between developments, taller buildings shall step-down to create a building height transition to adjacent single-story building(s).
1. This standard applies to new and vertically expanded buildings within 20 feet (as measured horizontally) of an existing single-story building with a height of 20 feet or less, as shown above.
2. The building height transition standard is met when the height of the taller building (x) does not exceed one (1) foot of height for every one (1) foot separating the two buildings (y), as shown above.

2.1.170 - Building Orientation
Typical Building Orientation
(Illustrations on following pages)
A. Purpose. The following standards are intended to orient buildings close to the street to promote human-scale development, slow traffic down, and encourage walking in neighborhoods. Placing residences and other buildings close to the street also encourages security and safety by having more eyes-on-the-street.
B. Applicability. This section applies to: single-family dwellings, including manufactured houses, duplexes, and attached townhomes that are subject to Site Design Review (3 or more attached units); multi-family housing; neighborhood commercial buildings; and public and institutional buildings.
C. Building orientation standards. All developments listed in B shall be oriented to a street. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 2.1.120.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Multi-family and Neighborhood Commercial building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial spaces). Alternatively, a multi-family building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in accordance with the standards in Chapter 3.1  Access and Circulation. In this case, at least one entrance shall be provided not more than 20 feet from the closest sidewalk or street.
3. Off-street parking, driveways, and other vehicle areas shall not be placed between streets and buildings. Single-family dwellings, including manufactured houses, duplexes, and attached townhouses, are excepted from this standard.
D. Public Buildings. The standard shall not apply to buildings which do not receive the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical equipment; and similar uses.)

2.1.190 - Special Standards for Certain Uses
This section supplements the standards contained Sections 2.1.100 through 2.1.190. It provides standards for the following land uses in order to control the scale and compatibility of those uses within the Residential District:
A. Zero-lot line (single family home). Zero-lot line houses are subject to the same standards as single family housing, except that a side yard setback is not required on one side of a typical lot (as shown below). This type of housing is permitted to allow development on smaller (i.e., narrower) lots and still provide usable outdoor living area in side-oriented yards. The following standards are intended to promote compatibility and privacy between adjacent buildings and allow for building maintenance:
Figure 2.1.200A  Zero-Lot Line Housing
1. Setbacks Adjacent to Non-Zero Lot Line Development. When a zero-lot line house shares a side property line with a non-zero lot line development, the zero-lot line building shall be setback from the common property line by a minimum of 10 feet;
2. Construction and Maintenance Easement. Prior to building permit approval, the applicant shall submit a copy of a recorded easement for every zero-lot line house that guarantees rights for the purpose of construction and maintenance of structures and yards. The easement shall stipulate that no fence or other obstruction shall be placed in a manner that would prevent maintenance of structures on the subject lot; and
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.1.22
City of Boardman April 23, 2013
2.1.190 - Special Standards for Certain Uses (continued)
3. Buffering. The building placement, landscaping, and/or design of windows shall provide a buffer for the occupants of abutting lots. For example, this standard is met by placing ground-floor windows (along the zero setback) above sight lines with direct views into adjacent yards,
or by directing views away from yards (e.g., bay window), or by using frosted/non-see-through windows, as necessary.
B. Manufactured homes on individual lots. Manufactured homes are permitted on individual lots, subject to all of the following design standards, consistent with ORS 197.307(5). Exception: The following standards do not apply to units which were placed on lots within the City prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

3. Residential Building Materials. The manufactured home shall have exterior siding and roofing which in color, material and appearance are similar or superior to the exterior siding and roof material used on nearby residences (e.g., horizontal wood or wood-appearance siding is considered superior to metal siding and roofing and vertical siding);
4. Garages and Carports. The manufactured home shall have a carport or a garage constructed of like exterior materials, concrete or asphalt floor, and concrete or asphalt driveway from the street to the structure. The City may require an attached or detached garage where that would be consistent with the predominant construction of immediately surrounding residences;
5. Thermal Envelope. The manufactured home shall be certified by the manufacturer to meet the thermal envelope requirements equivalent to those for a single-family dwelling constructed under the State Building Code. Evidence demonstrating that the manufactured home meets Super Good Cents energy efficiency standards is deemed to satisfy the exterior thermal envelope certification requirement. Additional manufacturers certification shall not be required;
6. Placement. The manufactured home shall be placed on an excavated and back-filled foundation and enclosed at the perimeter such that the manufactured home is located not more than 16 inches above grade, and complying with the minimum set-up standards of the adopted state Administrative Rules for Manufactured Dwellings, Chapter 918. Where the building site has a sloped grade, no more than 12 inches of the enclosing material shall be exposed on the uphill side of the home;
7. Foundation Skirt. The foundation area of the manufactured home shall be fully skirted with only 12 inches showing; and
8. Prohibited. The manufactured home shall not be located in a designated historic district.

2.2.100 Purpose
The primary purpose of the Commercial District is to create standards that allow for a variety of commercial uses in the Commercial areas of the City of Boardman. This Chapter also creates three Sub Districts---Tourist Commercial, City Center and Service Center. The Tourist Commercial Sub District provides additional standards for the areas of the City adjacent to Interstate 84. The Service Center Sub District provides standards for commercial and light industrial uses located west of the City. The City Center Sub District provides additional standards to create a concentrated and centralized commercial center to serve as the heart of the community. The City Center Sub District is created as an optional Sub District that may apply to certain geographic areas within the Commercial District. This geographic area has been designated to form the center of Boardmans commercial activities. This chapter provides standards for the orderly creation and expansion of the Commercial District by adherence to the following principles:
 Effective and efficient use of land and urban services;
 Direct commercial and retail development to a concentrated and localized area;
 Provide a mix of uses which provides a destination within the community and encourages walking over driving;
 Create connection with the balance of the community by directing connected transportation routes to commercial areas of the city;
 Provide for additional service employment opportunities.

2.2.120 Building Setbacks
In the Commercial District, buildings are placed to encourage pedestrian traffic. The setback standards are to encourage public spaces between sidewalks and buildings. The standards are also to encourage the formation of solid blocks of commercial and retail use to encourage a walkable commercial area.
Building setbacks are measured from the respective property line to the nearest vertical wall or foundation line, whichever is closer, of any building or structure. Setbacks for porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the property line. The setback standards, as listed, apply to primary structures and accessory structures. The standards may be modified only by approval of a Variance, in accordance with Chapter 5.1.
A. Front Yard Setbacks.
1. Minimum Setback. There is no minimum front yard setback required except to provide for vision clearance standards set in Chapter 3.1.
2. Maximum Setback. There is no required maximum setback except in the City Center Sub District, which has a 5-foot maximum setback. This standard is met for City Center Sub District development when 50 percent of the front building elevation is placed no more than 5 feet back from the front property line. On parcels with more than one building, this standard applies to the largest building. The setback standard may be increased when a usable public space with pedestrian amenities (e.g., extra-wide sidewalk, plaza, pocket park, outdoor dining area or town square with seating) is provided between the building and front property line. (See also, Pedestrian Amenities Standards in Section 2.2.160, and Design Standards in Section 2.2.150 for related building entrance standards.)
B. Rear Yard Setbacks.
1. Minimum Setback. The minimum rear yard setback for all structures shall be zero (0) feet for street access lots, and eight (8) feet for alley-access lots (distance from nearest vertical wall or foundation line of any building to rear property line or alley easement) in order to provide space for parallel parking, unless to provide for vision clearance standards set in Chapter 3.1.
2. Through-Lots. For buildings on through-lots (lots with front and rear frontage onto a street), the front yard setbacks in A will apply except to provide for vision clearance standards set in Chapter 3.1.
C. Side Yard Setbacks.
1. There is no minimum side yard setback required, except that buildings shall conform to the vision clearance standards in Chapter 3.1 and the applicable fire and building codes for attached structures, fire walls and related requirements.

Maximum height in the Tourist Commercial and Service Center Sub Districts are limited to four (4) stories or thirty-five (35) feet in height.
B. Method of Measurement. Building height is measured as the vertical distance above a reference datum measured to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof or to the deck line of a mansard roof or to the average height of the highest gable of a pitched or hipped roof. The reference datum shall be selected by either 2.2.140(B)(1 or 2), whichever yields a greater building height:
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five (5) foot horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more that ten (10) feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation ten (10) feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface described in subsection A is more than ten (10) feet above the lowest grade. The height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the building. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof equipment, flag-poles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy. These features will be no more than 25 feet measured from the highest point of the building.

2.2.190 City Center Sub District
A. Purpose and Applicability.
The City Center Sub District provides design standards for detailed, human-scaled design, while affording flexibility to use a variety of architectural styles. The City Center Sub District may be applied by a property owner and the City to a site, which meets the following locational criteria:
 The site shall be located within the Commercial District;
 The site shall be located within a radius of ¼-mile of (but not necessarily adjacent to) Main Street;
 The site shall be adjacent to Kinkade Road, Dillabaugh Boulevard or City Center Drive.
In order for this Sub District to apply, the property owner and the City shall describe how the site meets the above locational criteria. The application for the Sub District to apply is a Type III, quasi-judicial land use application described in Chapter 4. If the Sub District were applied, the following development would adhere to the Sub District standards:

c. Residential buildings subject to Site Design review shall comply with the Residential District design guidelines, as listed in Section 2.1.180, in addition to this section. Where conflicts occur, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
Compliance with all of the provisions of Sections 2.2.190.E.2-4, below, shall be required.
2. Building Orientation Standard. All of the developments listed in Section 2.2.190.E shall be oriented to a street. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
a. The minimum and maximum setback standards in Section 2.2.120 are met.
b. Buildings have their primary entrance(s) oriented to (facing) the street. Building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby entrances, entrances oriented to pedestrian plazas, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance facing a side yard when a direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street right-of-way.
c. Off-street parking, driveways or other vehicular circulation shall not be placed between a building and the street that is used to comply with subsection 2, above. On corner lots, buildings and their entrances shall be oriented to the street corner, as shown above; parking, driveways and other vehicle areas shall be prohibited between buildings and street corners.
3. Active Ground Floor Standard. The streetside portions of the lower floors of all buildings shall contain shops, offices, lobbies, and other activities oriented toward the passerby. Display windows for viewing the activity inside the building shall be provided.
4. Continuous Building Frontage. Buildings should be built to the property lines on either side so as to create a continuous line of storefronts. Access may be provided to the rear parking areas of the shops, offices etc. by an internal walkway.

E. Residential Uses. Higher density residential uses, such as multi-family buildings and attached townhomes, are permitted to encourage housing near employment, shopping and services. All residential developments shall comply with the following standards which are intended to require mixed-use development; conserve the communitys supply of commercial land for commercial uses; provide for designs which are compatible with the balance of the City Center Sub District; avoid or minimize impacts associated with traffic and parking; and ensure proper management and maintenance of common areas. Residential uses that existed prior to the effective date of this code are exempt from this section.
1. Mixed-Use Development. Residential uses may be permitted when part of a mixed-use development (residential with commercial or public/institutional use). Both vertical mixed-use (housing above the ground floor), and horizontal mixed-use (housing on the ground floor) developments are allowed, subject to the standards in 2.2.190(A)(2-6).
2. Limitation on street-level housing. Ground floor street frontage will be limited to upper floor residential access only. This standard is intended to reserve commercial space for commercial uses and public/institutional uses; it does not limit residential uses above the street level on upper stories.
3. Density. There is no minimum or maximum residential density standard. Density shall be controlled by building design, fire/life/safety design, the applicable lot coverage, floor area, building height standards and off-street parking requirements.
4. Parking, Garages, and Driveways. All off-street vehicle parking, including surface lots and garages, shall be oriented for reasonable access.

B. Rear Yard Setbacks. There is no required rear yard setback, except that buildings shall be set back from the Residential District by a minimum of 20 feet.
C. Side Yard Setbacks. There are no required side-yard setbacks, except that buildings shall be set back from the Residential District by a minimum of 15 feet.
D. Other Yard Requirements.
1. Buffering. A 20-foot minimum buffer zone shall be required between development and any adjacent Residential District. The buffer zone shall provide landscaping to screen parking, service and delivery areas, and walls without windows or entries. The buffer may contain pedestrian seating but shall not contain any trash receptacles or storage of equipment, materials, vehicles, etc. The landscaping standards in Chapter 3.2 may require buffering other situations, as well.
2. Neighborhood Access. Construction of pathway(s) and fence breaks in yard setbacks may be required to provide pedestrian connections to adjacent neighborhoods or other districts, in accordance with Chapter 3.1 - Access and Circulation Standards.
3. Building and Fire Codes. All developments shall meet applicable fire and building code standards, which may require setbacks different from those listed above (e.g., combustible materials, etc.).
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.4.3
City of Boardman October, 2002
2.4.130 Lot Coverage
The maximum allowable lot coverage in the Light Industrial District is 80 percent. The maximum allowable lot coverage is computed by calculating the total area covered by buildings and impervious (paved) surfaces, including accessory structures. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
2.4.140 Building Height
The following building height standards are intended to promote land use compatibility and flexibility for industrial development at an appropriate community scale:
A. Base Requirement. Buildings shall be no more than 3 stories or 35 feet in height, whichever is greater.
B. Performance Option. The allowable building height may be increased to 45 feet, when approved as part of a Conditional Use Permit. The development approval may require additional setbacks, stepping-down of building elevations, visual buffering, screening, and/or other appropriate measures to provide a height transition between the development and adjacent non-industrial development. Roof equipment and other similar features, which are necessary to the industrial operation, shall be screened, and may not exceed 55 feet in height without approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
C. Method of Measurement. Building height is measured as the vertical distance above a reference datum measured to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof or to the deck line of a mansard roof or to the average height of the highest gable of a pitched or hipped roof. (See Figure 2.1.160 for examples of measurement.) The reference datum shall be selected from either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building:
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface described in subsection a is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the building.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.4.4
City of Boardman October, 2002
2.4.150 Building Orientation
All of the following standards shall apply to new development within the Light Industrial District in order to reinforce streets as public spaces and encourage alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, and bicycling.
A. Building Entrances. All buildings shall have a primary entrance oriented to a street. Oriented to a street means that the building entrance faces the street, or is connected to the street by a direct and convenient pathway. Streets used to comply with this standard may be public streets, or private streets that contain sidewalks and street trees, in accordance with the design standards in Chapter 3.
B. Corner Lots. Buildings on corner lots shall have their primary entrance oriented to the street corner, or within 20 feet of the street corner (i.e., as measured from the lot corner). In this case, the street corner shall provide an extra-wide sidewalk or plaza area with landscaping, seating or other pedestrian amenities. The building corner shall provide architectural detailing or beveling to add visual interest to the corner.
C. Pathway Connections. Pathways shall be placed through yard setbacks as necessary to provide direct and convenient pedestrian circulation between developments and neighborhoods. Pathways shall conform to the standards in Chapter 3.
D. Arterial Streets. When the only street abutting a development is an arterial street, the buildings entrance(s) may be oriented to an internal drive. The internal drive shall provide a raised pathway connecting the building entrances to the street right-of-way. The pathway shall conform to the standards in Chapter 3.
E. Buffers. The City may require a 20-foot landscape buffer between development in the Light Industrial District and adjacent Residential District(s) to reduce light, glare, noise, and aesthetic impacts.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.4.5
City of Boardman October, 2002
2.4.160 Design Guidelines and Standards
All developments in the Light Industrial District shall be evaluated during Site Design Review for conformance with the criteria in A-B. Note: the example shown below is meant to illustrate typical building design elements, and should not be interpreted as a required design or style.
Figure 4.A  Design Features (Typical)
A. Building Mass. Where building elevations are oriented to the street in conformance with Section 2.4.150, design features such as windows, pedestrian entrances, building off-sets, projections, detailing, change in materials or similar features, shall be used to break up and articulate large building surfaces and volumes.
B. Pedestrian-Scale Building Entrances. Recessed entries, canopies, and/or similar features shall be used at the entries to buildings in order to create a pedestrian-scale.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 2.4.6
City of Boardman October, 2002
2.4.170 Special Standards for Certain Uses
A. High Traffic-Generating Uses.
Uses which are likely to generate significant levels of vehicle traffic (e.g., due to shipping, receiving, and/or customer traffic) shall require a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 4.4. Significant traffic means that the average number of daily trips, or the average number of peak hour trips, on any existing street would increase by 20 percent or greater and 100 vehicles per day as a result of the development. The City may require a traffic impact analysis (Chapter 4.10) prepared by a qualified professional prior to deeming a land use application complete, and determining whether the proposed use requires conditional use approval. Applicants may be required to provide a traffic analysis for review by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) for developments that increase traffic on state highways. The Conditional Use Permit shall include appropriate transportation improvement requirements, as identified by the traffic analysis and/or ODOT, in conformance with Chapter 3.4.1.
B. Wireless Communication Equipment.
Wireless communication equipment, including radio (i.e., cellular), television and similar types of transmission and receiving facilities are permitted, subject to the standards for wireless communication equipment in Chapter 3.6.2. Wireless communication equipment shall also comply with required setbacks, lot coverage and other applicable standards of the Light Industrial District.

Sections:
3.0.100 - Applicability
3.0.200 - Types of Design Standards
3.0.100 Applicability
All developments within the City must comply with the provisions of Chapters 3.1 through 3.6. Some developments, such as major projects requiring land division and/or site design review approval, may require detailed findings demonstrating compliance with each chapter of the code. For smaller, less complex projects, fewer code provisions may apply. Though some projects will not require land use or development permit approval (e.g., building of single family houses on platted lots, that are not subject to Chapter 3.7 - Sensitive Lands), they are still required to comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
3.0.200 Types of Design Standards
The Citys development design standards are contained in both Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. It is important to review both chapters, and all relevant code sections within the chapters, to determine which standards apply. The City may prepare checklists to assist property owners and applicants in determining which sections apply.
A. Chapter 3. The design standards contained within the following chapters apply throughout the City, for all land use types:
3.1 - Access and Circulation
3.2 - Landscaping, Street Trees, Fences and Walls
3.3 - Automobile and Bicycle Parking
3.4 - Public Facilities Standards

Chapter 3.1 - Access and Circulation
Sections:
3.1.100 - Purpose
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation
3.1.300 - Pedestrian Access and Circulation
3.1.100 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to help insure that developments provide safe and efficient access and circulation, for pedestrians and vehicles. Section 3.1.200 provides standards for vehicular access and circulation. Section 3.1.300 provides standards for pedestrian access and circulation. Standards for transportation improvements are provided in Chapter 3.4.100.
3.1.200 Vehicular Access and Circulation
A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this Section is to manage vehicle access to development through a connected street system, while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety, roadway capacity, and efficiency. Access shall be managed to maintain adequate performance standards and to maintain the functional classification of roadways as required by the Citys Comprehensive Plan. Major roadways, including highways, arterials, and collectors, serve as the primary system for moving people and goods. Access management is a primary concern on these roads. Local streets and alleys provide access to individual properties. If vehicular access and circulation are not properly designed, these roadways will be unable to accommodate the needs of development and serve their transportation function. This Section attempts to balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of the citizens of the City and the State of Oregon to safe and efficient travel. It also requires developments to construct planned streets (arterials and collectors) and to extend local streets.
To achieve this policy intent, state and local roadways have been categorized in the Comprehensive Plan by function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance and function. (See Chapter 3.4.100.) Regulations have been applied to these roadways for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents, personal injury, and property damage attributable to access systems, and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network. This will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures. These regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land, protect community character, and conserve natural resources by promoting well-designed road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned subdivision of land.
B. Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all public streets within the City and to all properties that abut these streets.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.1
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation (continued)
C. Access Permit Required. Access to a public street requires an Access Permit in accordance with the following procedures:
1. City Street Permits. Permits for access to City streets shall be subject to review and approval by the City Manager or his/her designee based on the standards contained in this Chapter, and the provisions of Chapter 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards. An access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant, or it may be attached to a land use decision notice as a condition of approval.
2. State Highway Permits. Permits for access to State highways shall be subject to review and approval by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), except when ODOT has delegated this responsibility to the City or Morrow County. In that case, the City or County shall determine whether access is granted based on its adopted standards.
3. County Highway Permits. Permits for access to County highways shall be subject to review and approval by Morrow County, except where the County has delegated this responsibility to the City, in which case the City shall determine whether access is granted based on adopted County standards.
D. Traffic Study Requirements. The City or other agency with access jurisdiction may require a traffic study prepared by a qualified professional to determine access, circulation and other transportation requirements. (See also, Section 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards, and Chapter 4.10.)
E. Conditions of Approval. The City or other agency with access permit jurisdiction may require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other vehicle access points, recording of reciprocal access easements (i.e., for shared driveways), development of a frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other mitigation as a condition of granting an access permit, to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the street and highway system. To obtain access to and from off-street parking areas shall not require the driver to back-out onto a public street (except for single-family, two-family, and three-family dwellings).
F. Access Options. When vehicle access is required for development (i.e., for off-street parking, delivery, service, drive-through facilities, etc.), access shall be provided by one of the following methods. These methods are options to the developer/subdivider, unless one method is specifically required by Chapter 2 (i.e., under Special Standards for Certain Uses). A minimum of 10 feet per lane is required.
1. Option 1. Access is from an existing or proposed alley or mid-block lane. If a property has access to an alley or lane, direct access to a public street is not permitted.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.2
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation (continued)
2. Option 2. Access is from a private street or driveway connected to an adjoining property that has direct access to a public street (i.e., shared driveway). A public access easement covering the driveway shall be recorded in this case to assure access to the closest public street for all users of the private street/drive.
3. Option 3. Access is from a public street adjacent to the development parcel. If practicable, the owner/developer may be required to close or consolidate an existing access point as a condition of approving a new access. Street accesses shall comply with the access spacing standards in Section G, below.
4. Subdivisions Fronting On an Arterial Street. New residential land divisions fronting on an arterial street shall be required to provide alleys or secondary (local or collector) streets for access to individual lots. When alleys or secondary streets cannot be constructed due to topographic or other physical constraints or existing development patterns access may be provided by consolidating front-access driveways for clusters of two or more lots (e.g., includes flag lots and mid-block lanes).
5. Double-Frontage Lots. When a lot has frontage onto two or more streets, access shall be provided first from the street with the lowest classification. For example, access shall be provided from a local street before a collector or arterial street. Except for corner lots, the creation of new double-frontage lots shall be prohibited in the Residential District, unless topographic or physical constraints or existing development patterns require the formation of such lots. When double-frontage lots are permitted in the Residential District, a landscape buffer with trees and/or shrubs and ground cover not less than 15 feet wide shall be provided between the back yard fence/wall and the sidewalk or street; maintenance shall be assured by the owner (i.e., through homeowners association, etc.).
Important cross-references to other code sections: Chapters 2 and 3 may require buildings placed at or near the front property line and driveways and parking areas oriented to the side or rear yard. The City may require the dedication of public right-of-way and construction of a street (e.g., frontage road, alley or other street) when the development impact is proportionate to the need for such a street, and the street is identified by the Comprehensive Plan or an adopted Local Streets Plan. (Please refer to Section 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards.)
G. Access Spacing. Driveway accesses shall be separated from other driveways and street intersections in accordance with the following standards and procedures:
1. Local Streets. The minimum feet of separation on local streets (as measured from the sides of
the driveway/street) shall be determined based on the policies and standards contained in Table 3.1.200 G except as provided in subsection 3, below.
2. Arterial and Collector Streets. Access spacing on collector and arterial streets and at controlled intersections (i.e., with four-way stop sign or traffic signal) shall be determined by the policies and standards in Table 3.1.200 G.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.3
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation (continued)
3. Access to State Highways shall be subject to the applicable standards and policies contained in the Interstate Highway 84 Corridor Plan. See Table 9A and Table 9 in the Transportation System Plan (TSP).
4. Special Provisions for All Streets. Direct street access may be restricted for some land uses, in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 2 - Land Use Districts. For example, access consolidation, shared access, and/or access separation greater than that specified by subsections 1-2, may be required by the permitting agency for the purpose of protecting the function, safety and operation of the street for all users. (See Section I, below.) Where no other alternatives exist, the permitting agency may allow construction of an access connection along the property line farthest from an intersection. In such cases, directional connections (i.e., right in/out, right in only, or right out only) may be required.
5. Corner Clearance. The distance from a street intersection to a driveway or other street access shall meet or exceed the minimum spacing requirements for the street classification in the Citys Transportation System Plan.
6. Variance. A variance to vehicle access and circulation standards shall follow procedures in Chapter 5.1.300.A.

H. Number of Access Points. For single-family (detached and attached), two-family, and three-family housing types, one street access point is permitted per lot; except that two access points may be permitted for two-family and three-family housing on corner lots (i.e., no more than one access per street), subject to the access spacing standards in Section G, above. The number of street access points for multiple family, commercial, industrial, and public/institutional developments shall be minimized to protect the function, safety and operation of the street(s) and sidewalk(s) for all users. Shared access may be required, in conformance with Section I, below, in order to maintain the required access spacing, and minimize the number of access points.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.4
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation (continued)
I. Shared Driveways. Where feasible, the number of driveway and private street accesses to public streets shall be minimized for commercial and industrial uses by the sharing of driveways between adjoining parcels. The City shall require shared driveways as a condition of land division or site design review for commercial and industrial uses, as applicable, for traffic safety and access management purposes in accordance with the following standards:
1. Shared driveways and frontage streets may be required to consolidate access onto a collector or arterial street. When shared driveways or frontage streets are required, they shall be stubbed to adjacent developable parcels to indicate future extension. Stub means that a driveway or street temporarily ends at the property line, but may be extended in the future as the adjacent parcel develops. Developable means that a parcel is either vacant or it is likely to receive additional development (i.e., due to infill or redevelopment potential).
2. Access easements for the benefit of affected properties shall be recorded for all shared driveways, including pathways, at the time of final plat approval (Chapter 4.3) or as a condition of site development approval (Chapter 4.2).
3. Exception. Shared driveways are not required when existing development patterns or physical constraints (e.g., topography, parcel configuration, existing development or similar conditions) prevent extending the street/driveway in the future.
4. Cross Access. Cross access is encouraged, and may be required as a condition of approval between contiguous sites in the Commercial and Industrial Districts and for multi-family housing in the Residential Multi-family Sub District of the Residential District, in order to provide for more direct circulation between sites and uses for pedestrians, bicycles and drivers.
J. Street Connectivity. In order to promote efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation throughout the City, land divisions and large site developments shall produce complete blocks bounded by a connecting network of public and/or private streets, in accordance with the following standards:
1. Block Length and Perimeter. The maximum block length and perimeter shall not exceed:
a. 600 feet length and 1,600 feet perimeter in the Residential District and Sub Districts;
b. 600 feet length and 1,600 feet perimeter in the Commercial District;
c. Not applicable to the General Industrial District;
d. 800 feet length and 2,000 feet perimeter in the Tourist Commercial Sub District, Service Center Sub District and Light Industrial District, except as required for commercial developments subject to Chapter 2.2, Section 140;
2. Street Standards. Public and private streets shall also conform to Chapter 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards, Section 3.1.300 - Pedestrian Circulation, and applicable Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) design standards.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.5
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation (continued)
3. Exception. Exceptions to the above standards may be granted when blocks are divided by one or more pathway(s), in conformance with the provisions of Section 3.1.300.A. Pathways shall be located to minimize out-of-direction travel by pedestrians and may be designed to accommodate bicycles. An exception may also be granted for topography, natural resources, existing development or other permanent features such as Interstates and railroad track right-of-ways.
K. Driveway Openings. Driveway openings [or curb cuts] shall be the minimum width necessary to provide the required number of vehicle travel lanes (10 feet for each travel lane). The following standards (i.e., as measured where the front property line meets the sidewalk or right-of-way) are required to provide adequate site access, minimize surface water runoff, and avoid conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians:
1. Single family, two-family, and three-family uses shall have a minimum driveway width of 10 feet, and a maximum width of 24 feet, (except that one recreational vehicle pad driveway may be provided in addition to the standard driveway for each lot.
2. Multiple family uses with 4 to 7 dwelling units shall have a minimum driveway width of 20 feet, and a maximum width of 24 feet.
3. Multiple family uses with more than 8 dwelling units, and off-street parking areas with 16 or more parking spaces, shall have a minimum driveway width of 24 feet, and a maximum width of 30 feet. These dimensions may be increased if the City Manager or his/her designee determines that more than two lanes are required based on the number of trips generated or the need for turning lanes.
4. Access widths for all other uses shall be based on 10 feet of width for every travel lane, except that driveways providing direct access to parking spaces shall conform to the parking area standards in Chapter 3.3.
5. Driveway Aprons. Driveway aprons (when required) shall be constructed of concrete and shall be installed between the street right-of-way and the private drive, as shown in Figure 3.1.200K. Driveway aprons shall conform to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for sidewalks and pathways, which require a continuous route of travel that is a minimum of 3 feet in width, with a cross slope not exceeding 2 percent.
6. Driveway approaches. Driveway approaches shall be designed and located to provide an existing vehicle with an unobstructed view. Construction of driveways along acceleration or deceleration lanes or tapers should be avoided due to the potential for vehicle conflicts.
7. Loading area design. The design of driveways and on-site maneuvering and loading areas for commercial and industrial developments shall consider the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting vehicles to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on the public street or causing unsafe conflicts with on-site circulation.

Figure 3.1.200K  Driveway Openings
L. Fire Access and Parking Area Turn-around. A fire equipment access drive shall be provided for any portion of an exterior wall of the first story of a building that is located more than 150 feet from an existing public street or approved fire equipment access drive. Parking areas shall provide adequate aisles or turn-around areas for service and delivery vehicles so that all vehicles may enter the street in a forward manner. For requirements related to cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets, please refer to Section 3.4.100.M.
M. Vertical Clearances. Driveways, private streets, aisles, turn-around areas and ramps shall have a minimum vertical clearance of 13' 6  for their entire length and width.
N. Vision Clearance. No signs, structures or vegetation in excess of three feet in height shall be placed in vision clearance areas, as shown in Figure 3.1.200N. This standard applies to the following types of roadways: streets, driveways, alleyways and railways. The minimum vision clearance area may be increased by the City Manager or his/her designee upon finding that more sight distance is required (i.e., due to traffic speeds, roadway alignment, etc.). An exception to this standard may be granted by the City Manager or his/her designee to allow utility structures (such as electrical transformers) for necessary services. This exception does not include the installation of utility poles.
O. Construction. The following development and maintenance standards shall apply to all driveways and private streets.
1. Surface Options. Driveways, parking areas, aisles, and turn-arounds may be paved with asphalt, concrete or comparable surfacing, or a durable non-paving material may be used to reduce surface water runoff and protect water quality. Paving surfaces shall be subject to review and approval by the City Manager or his/her designee.

Pedestrian System for Multi-Family Development
Figure 3.1.300A
A. Pedestrian Access and Circulation. To ensure safe, direct and convenient pedestrian circulation, all developments, except single family detached housing (i.e., on individual lots), shall provide a continuous pedestrian and/or multi-use pathway system. (Pathways only provide for pedestrian circulation. Multi-use pathways accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.) The system of pathways shall be designed based on the standards in subsections 1-3, below:
1. Continuous Pathways. The pathway system shall extend throughout the development site, and connect to all future phases of development, adjacent trails, public parks and open space areas whenever possible. The developer may also be required to connect or stub pathway(s) to adjacent streets and private property, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1.200 - Vehicular Access and Circulation, and Chapter 3.4. 100 - Transportation Standards.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.9
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.300  Pedestrian Access and Circulation (continued)
2. Safe, Direct, and Convenient Pathways. Pathways within developments shall provide safe, reasonably direct and convenient connections between primary building entrances and all adjacent streets, based on the following definitions:
a. Reasonably direct. A route that does not deviate unnecessarily from a straight line or a route that does not involve a significant amount of out-of-direction travel for likely users.
b. Safe and convenient. Bicycle and pedestrian routes that are reasonably free from hazards and provide a reasonably direct route of travel between destinations.
c. Commercial and Industrial Primary Entrance. For commercial, industrial, mixed use, public, and institutional buildings, the primary entrance is the main public entrance to the building. In the case where no public entrance exists, street connections shall be provided to the main employee entrance.
d. Residential Entrance. For residential buildings the primary entrance is the front door (i.e., facing the street). For multifamily buildings in which each unit does not have its own exterior entrance, the primary entrance may be a lobby, courtyard or breezeway which serves as a common entrance for more than one dwelling.
3. Connections Within Development. For all developments subject to Site Design Review, pathways shall connect all building entrances to one another. In addition, pathways shall connect all parking areas, storage areas, recreational facilities and common areas (as applicable), and adjacent developments to the site, as applicable.
4. Street Connectivity. Pathways (for pedestrians and bicycles) shall be provided at or near mid-block where the block length exceeds the length required by Section 3.1.200 J. Pathways shall also be provided where cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets are planned, to connect the ends of the streets together, to other streets, and/or to other developments. Pathways used to comply with these standards shall conform to all of the following criteria:
a. Multi-use pathways (i.e., for pedestrians and bicyclists) are no less than 10 feet wide and located within a 20-foot-wide right-of-way or easement that allows access for emergency vehicles;
b. If the streets within the subdivision or neighborhood are lighted, the pathways shall also be lighted;
c. Stairs or switchback paths using a narrower right-of-way/easement may be required in lieu of a multi-use pathway where grades are steep;
d. The City may require landscaping within the pathway easement/right-of-way for screening and the privacy of adjoining properties;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.1.10
City of Boardman October 2002
3.1.300  Pedestrian Access and Circulation (continued)
e. The City Manager or his/her designee may determine, based upon facts in the record, that a pathway is impracticable due to: physical or topographic conditions (e.g., freeways, railroads, extremely steep slopes, sensitive lands, and similar physical constraints); buildings or other existing development on adjacent properties that physically prevent a connection now or in the future, considering the potential for redevelopment; and sites where the provisions of recorded leases, easements, covenants, restrictions, or other agreements recorded as of the effective date of this Code prohibit the pathway connection.

3.1.300  Pedestrian Access and Circulation (continued)
B. Design and Construction. Pathways shall conform to all of the standards in 1-5:
1. Vehicle/Pathway Separation. Where pathways are parallel and adjacent to a driveway or street (public or private), they shall be raised 6 inches and curbed, or separated from the driveway/street by a 5-foot minimum strip with bollards, a landscape berm, or other physical barrier. If a raised path is used, the ends of the raised portions must be equipped with curb ramps.
2. Housing/Pathway Separation. Pedestrian pathways shall be separated a minimum of 5 feet from all residential living areas on the ground floor, except at building entrances. Separation is measured from the pathway edge to the closest dwelling unit. The separation area shall be landscaped in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 3.3. No pathway/building separation is required for commercial, industrial, public, or institutional uses.
3. Crosswalks. Where pathways cross a parking area, driveway, or street (crosswalk), they shall be clearly marked with contrasting paving materials, humps/raised crossings, or painted striping. An example of contrasting paving material is the use of a concrete crosswalk through an asphalt driveway. If painted striping is used, it shall consist of thermo-plastic striping or similar type of durable application.
4. Pathway Surface. Pathway surfaces shall be concrete, asphalt, brick/masonry pavers, or other durable surface, at least 5 feet wide, and shall conform to ADA requirements. Multi-use paths (i.e., for bicycles and pedestrians) shall be the same materials, at least 10 feet wide. (See also, Section 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards for public, multi-use pathway standard.)
5. Accessible routes. Pathways shall comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires accessible routes of travel.

Chapter 3.2 - Landscaping, Street Trees, Fences and Walls
Sections:
3.2.100 - Purpose
3.2.200 - New Landscaping
3.2.300 - Street Trees
3.2.400 - Fences and Walls
3.2.100 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to promote community health, safety and welfare by protecting natural vegetation, and setting development standards for landscaping, street trees, fences and walls. Together, these elements of the natural and built environment contribute to the visual quality, environmental health and character of the community. Trees provide climate control through shading during summer months and wind screening during winter. Trees and other plants can also buffer pedestrians from traffic. Walls, fences, trees and other landscape materials also provide vital screening and buffering between land uses. Landscaped areas help to control surface water drainage and can improve water quality, as compared to paved or built surfaces.
The chapter is organized into the following sections:
Section 3.2.200 - New Landscaping sets standards for and requires landscaping of all development sites that require Site Design Review. This section also requires buffering for parking and maneuvering areas, and between different land use districts. Note that other landscaping standards are provided in Chapter 2 - Land Use Districts, for specific types of development.
Section 3.2.300 - Street Trees sets standards for and requires planting of trees along all streets for shading, comfort and aesthetic purposes.
Section 3.2.400 - Fences and Walls, sets standards for new fences and walls, including maximum allowable height and materials, to promote security, personal safety, privacy, and aesthetics.
3.2.200 - New Landscaping
A. Applicability. This Section shall apply to all developments requiring Site Design Review, and other developments with required landscaping.
B. Landscaping Plan Required. A landscape plan is required. All landscape plans shall conform to the requirements in Chapter 4.2, Section 500.B (Landscape Plans).
C. Landscape Area Standards. The minimum percentage of required landscaping equals:
1. Residential Districts. 20 percent of the site.
2. Commercial District. 10 percent of the site.

City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.2.1
City of Boardman January, 2005
3. General Industrial District. 20 percent of the site.
4. Light Industrial District. 10 percent of the site.
D. Landscape Materials. Landscape materials include trees, shrubs, ground cover plants, non-plant
ground covers, and outdoor hardscape features, as described below:
1. Natural Vegetation. Natural vegetation shall be preserved or planted where practicable.
2. Plant Selection. A combination of trees, shrubs and ground covers shall be used for all planted
areas, the selection of which shall be based on local climate, exposure, water availability, and
drainage conditions. As necessary, soils shall be amended to allow for healthy plant growth.
3. Hardscape features (i.e., patios, decks, plazas, etc.) may cover up to 30 percent of the required
landscape area; except in the City Center Sub District where hardscape features may cover up
to 50 percent of the landscape area. Swimming pools, sports courts and similar active
recreation facilities may not be counted toward fulfilling the landscape requirement.
4. Non-plant Ground Covers. Bark dust, chips, aggregate or other non-plant ground covers may
be used, but shall cover no more than 25 percent of the area to be landscaped. Coverage is
measured based on the size of plants at maturity or after 2 years of growth, whichever comes
sooner.
5. Tree Size. Trees shall have a minimum caliper size of 2 inches or greater when planted.
6. Ground Cover Ground cover plants shall be sized and spaced so that they grow together to
cover a minimum of 75 percent of the underlying soil within 5 years.

E. Landscape Design Standards. All yards, parking lots and required street tree planter strips shall
be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter (Sections 3.2.100 through 3.2.400).
Landscaping shall be installed with development to provide erosion control, visual interest,
buffering, privacy, open space and pathway identification, shading and wind buffering, based on
the following standards:
1. Yard Setback Landscaping. Landscaping shall satisfy the following criteria:
a. Provide visual screening and privacy within side and rear yards; while leaving front yards
and building entrances mostly visible for security purposes;
b. Use shrubs and trees as wind breaks, as appropriate;
c. Define pedestrian pathways and open space areas with landscape materials;
d. Provide focal points within a development, such as signature trees (i.e., large or unique
trees), hedges and flowering plants;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.2.3
City of Boardman January, 2005
3.2.200 - New Landscaping (continued)
e. Use trees to provide summer shading within common open space areas, and within front
yards when street trees cannot be provided;
f. Use a combination of plants for year-long color and interest;
g. Use landscaping to screen outdoor storage and mechanical equipment areas, and to enhance
graded areas such as berms, swales and detention/retention ponds.
2. Parking areas. A minimum of five percent of the combined area of all parking areas, as
measured around the perimeter of all parking spaces and maneuvering areas, shall be
landscaped. Such landscaping shall consist of an evenly distributed mix of shade trees with
shrubs and/or ground cover plants. Evenly distributed means that the trees and other plants
are distributed around the parking lot perimeter and between parking bays to provide a partial
canopy. At a minimum, one tree per 4 parking spaces total shall be planted to create a partial
tree canopy over and around the parking area. All parking areas with more than 20 spaces shall
include landscape islands with trees to break up the parking area into rows of not more than 12
contiguous parking spaces. All landscaped areas shall have minimum dimensions of 4 feet by 4
feet to ensure adequate soil, water, and space for healthy plant growth when used as a modified
swale in accordance with detention standards found in the Citys Stormwater Design Standards
(Chapter 3.5).
3. Buffering and Screening Required - Buffering and screening are required under the following
conditions:
a. Parking/Maneuvering Area Adjacent to Streets and Drives. Where a parking or
maneuvering area is adjacent and parallel to a street or driveway, a decorative wall
(masonry or similar quality material), arcade, trellis, evergreen hedge, or similar screen
shall be established parallel to the street or driveway. The required wall or screening shall
provide breaks, as necessary, to allow for access to the site and sidewalk by pedestrians via
pathways. The design of the wall or screening shall also allow for visual surveillance of
the site for security. Evergreen hedges used to comply with this standard shall be a
minimum of 36 inches in height at maturity, and shall be of such species, number and
spacing to provide the required screening within one year after planting. Any areas
between the wall/hedge and the street/driveway line shall be landscaped with plants or
other ground cover. All walls shall be maintained in good condition, or otherwise replaced
by the owner.
b. Parking/Maneuvering Area Adjacent to Building. Where a parking or maneuvering area, or
driveway, is adjacent to a building, the area shall be separated from the building by a raised
pathway, plaza, or landscaped buffer no less than 3 feet in width. Raised curbs, bollards,
wheel stops, or other design features shall be used to protect buildings from being damaged
by vehicles. When parking areas are located adjacent to residential ground-floor living
space, a landscape buffer is required to fulfill this requirement.

3.2.200 - New Landscaping (continued)
c. Screening of Mechanical Equipment, Outdoor Storage, Service and Delivery Areas, and
Automobile-Oriented Uses. All mechanical equipment, outdoor storage and
manufacturing, and service and delivery areas, shall be screened from view from all public
streets and Residential districts. Screening shall be provided by one or more the following:
decorative wall (i.e., masonry or similar quality material), evergreen hedge, non-see
through fence, or a similar feature that provides a non-see through barrier. Walls, fences,
and hedges shall comply with the vision clearance requirements and provide for pedestrian
circulation, in accordance with Chapter 3.1 - Access and Circulation. (See Section 3.2.400
for standards related to fences and walls.)
F. Maintenance and Irrigation. The use of drought-tolerant plant species is encouraged, and may be
required when irrigation is not available. Irrigation shall be provided for plants that are not
drought-tolerant. If the plantings fail to survive, the property owner shall replace them with an
equivalent specimen (i.e., evergreen shrub replaces evergreen shrub, deciduous tree replaces
deciduous tree, etc.). All other landscape features required by this Code shall be maintained in
good condition, or otherwise replaced by the owner in perpetuity.
G. Additional Requirements. Additional buffering and screening may be required for specific land
uses, as identified by Chapter 2, and the City may require additional landscaping through the
Conditional Use Permit process (Chapter 4.4).
3.2.300 - Street Trees
Street trees shall be planted for all developments that are subject to Site Design Review. Requirements
for street tree planting strips are provided in Section 3.4.100 - Transportation Standards. Planting of
unimproved streets shall be deferred until the construction of curbs and sidewalks. Street trees shall
conform to the following standards and guidelines:
A. Growth Characteristics. Trees shall be selected based on growth characteristics and site
conditions, including available space, overhead clearance, soil conditions, exposure, and desired
color and appearance. The following should guide tree selection:
1. Provide a broad canopy where shade is desirable.
2. Use low-growing trees for spaces under utility wires.
3. Select trees which can be limbed-up where vision clearance is a concern.
4. Use narrow or columnar trees where awnings or other building features limit growth, or
where greater visibility is desired between buildings and the street.
5. Use species with similar growth characteristics on the same block for design continuity.

9. Use deciduous trees for summer shade and winter sun.
B. Caliper Size. The minimum caliper size at planting shall be 2 inches, based on the American
Association of Nurserymen Standards.
C. Spacing and Location. Street trees shall be planted within existing and proposed planting strips,
and in sidewalk tree wells on streets without planting strips. Street tree spacing shall be based upon
the type of tree(s) selected and the canopy size at maturity. In general, trees shall be spaced no
more than 30 feet apart, except where planting a tree would conflict with existing trees, retaining
walls, utilities and similar physical barriers.
D. Soil Preparation, Planting and Care. The Developer shall be responsible for planting street trees,
including soil preparation, ground cover material, staking, and temporary irrigation for two years
after planting. The developer shall also be responsible for tree care (pruning, watering, fertilization,
and replacement as necessary) during the first two years after planting.
E. Assurances. ALTERNATIVE 1: The developer shall pay a fee to the City, in accordance with the
adopted fee schedule, for each required street tree. The fee shall cover the Citys expense for
planting and the first two years of care.
ALTERNATIVE 2: The City shall require the developer to provide a performance and
maintenance bond in an amount determined by the City Manager or his/her designee, to ensure the
planting of the tree(s) and care during the first two years after planting.

Chapter 3.3 - Vehicle and Bicycle Parking
Sections:
3.3.100 - Purpose
3.3.200 - Applicability
3.3.300 - Automobile Parking Standards
3.3.400 - Bicycle Parking Standards
3.3.100 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to provide basic and flexible standards for development of vehicle and bicycle parking. The design of parking areas is critically important to the viability of some commercial areas, pedestrian and driver safety, the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets, and community image and livability. Historically, some communities have required more parking than is necessary for some land uses, paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use. Because vehicle parking facilities can occupy large amounts of land, they must be planned and designed carefully to use the land efficiently while maintaining the visual character of the community. This chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs by providing a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements (i.e., minimum and performance-based standards). This chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation, commuting, and general transportation. Children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community.
3.3.200 Applicability
All developments subject to site design review (defined in Chapter 4.2), including development of parking facilities, shall comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
3.3.300 Vehicle Parking Standards
The minimum number of required off-street vehicle parking spaces (i.e., parking that is located in parking lots and garages and not in the street right-of-way) shall be determined based on the standards in Section 3.3.300.A. There is no minimum number of off-street parking spaces required in the City Center Sub District (or in designated historic districts), however, the maximum parking standards of this Chapter apply in those areas.
The number of required off-street vehicle parking spaces shall be determined in accordance with the following standards. Off-street parking spaces may include spaces in garages, carports, parking lots, and/or driveways if vehicles are not parked in a vehicle travel lane (including emergency or fire access lanes), public right-of-way, pathway or landscape area. Credit shall be allowed for on-street parking, as provided in Section 3.3.300.B.

5. Unspecified Uses
Where a use is not specifically listed in this table, parking requirements shall be determined by finding that the use is similar to one listed in terms of parking needs.
B. Parking Location and Shared Parking
1. Location. Vehicle parking is allowed only on approved parking shoulders (streets), within garages, carports and other structures, or on driveways or parking lots that have been developed in conformance with this code. Specific locations for parking are indicated in Chapter 2 for some land uses (e.g., the requirement that parking be located to side or rear of buildings, with access from alleys, for some uses). (See also, Section 3.1 - Access and Circulation).
2. Off-site parking. Except for single family, two-family, and three-family dwellings, the vehicle parking spaces required by this Chapter may be located on another parcel of land, provided the parcel is within ¼ mile of the use it serves. The distance from the parking area to the use shall be measured from the nearest parking space to a building entrance, following a sidewalk or other pedestrian route. The right to use the off-site parking must be evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, easement, or similar written instrument.
3. Mixed uses. If more than one type of land use occupies a single structure or parcel of land, the
total requirements for off-street automobile parking shall be the sum of the requirements for all uses, unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are actually less (i.e., the uses operate on different days or at different times of the day). In that case, the total requirements shall be reduced accordingly.
4. Shared parking. Required parking facilities for two or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may be satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that the owners or operators show that the need for parking facilities does not materially overlap (e.g., uses primarily of a daytime versus nighttime nature), and provided that the right of joint use is evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument establishing the joint use.
5. Availability of facilities. Owners of off-street parking facilities may post a sign indicating that all parking on the site is available only for residents, customers and/or employees, as applicable. Signs shall conform to the standards of Chapter 3.6.
C. Maximum Number of Parking Spaces. The number of parking spaces provided by any particular use in ground surface parking lots shall not exceed the required minimum number of spaces provided by this Section by more than 10%. Spaces provided on-street, or within the building footprint of structures, such as in rooftop parking, or under-structure parking, or in multi-level parking above or below surface lots, shall not apply towards the maximum number of allowable spaces. Parking spaces provided through shared parking also do not apply toward the maximum number.

3. Schools. Schools both private and public shall provide one bicycle parking space for every 10 students and employees.
4. Colleges and trade schools. College and trade schools shall provide one bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle spaces plus one space for every dormitory unit.
5. Multiple Uses. For buildings with multiple uses (such as a commercial or mixed use center), bicycle parking standards shall be calculated by using the total number of motor vehicle parking spaces required for the entire development. A minimum of one bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle parking spaces is required.
B. Exemptions. This Section does not apply to single family, two-family, and three-family housing (attached, detached or manufactured housing), home occupations, agriculture and livestock uses, or other developments with fewer than 10 vehicle parking spaces.
C. Location and Design. Bicycle parking shall be conveniently located with respect to both the street right-of-way and at least one building entrance (e.g., no farther away than the closest parking space). It should be incorporated whenever possible into building design and coordinated with the design of street furniture when it is provided. Street furniture includes benches, street lights, planters and other pedestrian amenities. Bicycle parking spaces shall be located in front of stores along the street, either on the sidewalks or in specially constructed areas such as pedestrian curb extensions. Inverted "U" style racks are recommended. Bicycle parking shall not interfere with pedestrian passage, leaving a clear area of at least 36 inches between bicycles and other existing and potential obstructions. Spaces may or may not be sheltered.
D. Visibility and Security. Bicycle parking shall be visible to cyclists from street sidewalks or building entrances, so that it provides sufficient security from theft and damage;
E. Options for Storage. Bicycle parking requirements for long-term and employee parking can be met by providing a bicycle storage room, bicycle lockers, racks, or other secure storage space inside or outside of the building;

A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide planning and design standards for public and private transportation facilities and utilities. Streets are the most common public spaces, touching virtually every parcel of land. Therefore, one of the primary purposes of this Chapter is to provide standards for attractive and safe streets that can accommodate vehicle traffic from planned growth, and provide a range of transportation options, including options for driving, walking and bicycling. This Chapter is also intended to implement the Citys Transportation System Plan.
Important cross-reference to other standards: The City requires that streets provide direct and convenient access, including regular intersections. Chapter 3.1 - Access and Circulation, provides standards for intersections and blocks, and requires pedestrian access ways to break up long blocks.
B. Applicability. Unless otherwise provided, the standard specifications for construction, reconstruction or repair of transportation facilities, utilities and other public improvements within the City shall occur in accordance with the standards of this Chapter. No development may occur unless the public facilities related to development comply with the public facility requirements established in this Chapter.
C. Standard Specifications. The City Manager or his/her designee shall establish standard construction specifications consistent with the design standards of this Chapter and application of engineering principles. They are incorporated in this code by reference.
D Conditions of Development Approval. No development may occur unless required public facilities are in place or guaranteed, in conformance with the provisions of this Code. Improvements required as a condition of development approval, when not voluntarily accepted by the applicant, shall be roughly proportional to the impact of development. Findings in the development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are roughly proportional to the impact.

3.4.100 Transportation Standards
A. Development Standards. No development shall occur unless the development has frontage or approved access to a public street, in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 3.1 - Access and Circulation, and the following standards are met:
1. Streets within or adjacent to a development shall be improved in accordance with the Transportation System Plan and the provisions of this Chapter.
2. Development of new streets, and additional street width or improvements planned as a portion of an existing street, shall be improved in accordance with this Section, and public streets shall be dedicated to the applicable city, county or state jurisdiction;
3. New streets and drives connected to a collector or arterial street shall be paved; and
4. The City may accept a future improvement guarantee [e.g., the property owner agrees not to remonstrate (object) against the formation of a local improvement district in the future which the City may require as a deed restriction] in lieu of street improvements if one or more of the following conditions exist:
a. A partial improvement may create a potential safety hazard to motorists or pedestrians;
b. Due to the developed condition of adjacent properties it is unlikely that street improvements would be extended in the foreseeable future and the improvement associated with the project under review does not, by itself, provide increased street safety or capacity, or improved pedestrian circulation;
c. The improvement would be in conflict with an adopted capital improvement plan; or
d. The improvement is associated with an approved land partition on property zoned residential and the proposed land partition does not create any new streets.
B. Variances. Variances to the transportation design standards in this Section may be granted by means of a Class B Variance, as governed by Chapter 5.1 - Variances.

G. Traffic Signals and Traffic Calming Features
1. Traffic-calming features, such as traffic circles, curb extensions, narrow residential streets, and special paving may be used to slow traffic in neighborhoods and areas with high pedestrian traffic.
2. Traffic signals shall be required with development when traffic signal warrants are met, in conformance with the Highway Capacity Manual, and Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The location of traffic signals shall be noted on approved street plans. Where a proposed street intersection will result in an immediate need for a traffic signal, a signal meeting approved specifications shall be installed. The developers cost and the timing of improvements shall be included as a condition of development approval.
3. Traffic signals and traffic calming features on roads under State jurisdiction shall be determined by the Oregon Department of Transportation. When obtaining access to off-street parking areas (both to and from), backing onto a public street shall not be permitted, except for single-family, two-family, and three-family dwellings.
H. Future Street Plan and Extension of Streets
1. A future street plan shall be filed by the applicant in conjunction with an application for a subdivision in order to facilitate orderly development of the street system. The plan shall show the pattern of existing and proposed future streets from the boundaries of the proposed land division and shall include all of adjacent, abutting and other parcels within 400 feet of the proposed land division. The street plan is not binding; rather it is intended to show potential future street extensions with future development.
2. Streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the parcel or tract to be developed, when the Planning Commission determines that the extension is necessary to give street access to, or permit a satisfactory future division of, adjoining land. The point where the streets temporarily end shall conform to a-c, below:
a. These extended streets or street stubs to adjoining properties are not considered to be cul-de-sacs or dead-ends since they are intended to continue as through streets when the adjoining property is developed.
b. A barricade (e.g., fence, bollards, boulders or similar vehicle barrier) shall be constructed at the end of the street by the subdivider and shall not be removed until authorized by the City or other applicable agency with jurisdiction over the street. The cost of the barricade shall be included in the street construction cost.
c. Temporary (all-weather) turnarounds (e.g., hammerhead or bulb-shaped configuration) shall be constructed for stub streets over 150 feet in length.

3.4.100 Transportation Standards (continued)
I. Street Alignment and Connections
1. Staggering of streets making "T" intersections at collectors and arterials shall not be designed so that jogs of less than 300 feet on such streets are created, as measured from the centerline of the street.
2. Spacing between local street intersections shall have a minimum separation as per Table 3.1.200.G, except where more closely spaced intersections are designed to provide an open space, pocket park, common area or similar neighborhood amenity. This standard applies to four-way and three-way (offset) intersections.
3. All local and collector streets that abut a development site shall be extended within the site to provide through circulation unless prevented by environmental or topographical constraints, existing development patterns or compliance with other standards in this code. This exception applies when it is not possible to redesign or reconfigure the street pattern to provide required extensions. Land is considered topographically constrained if the slope is greater than 15% for a distance of 250 feet or more. In the case of environmental or topographical constraints, the mere presence of a constraint is not sufficient to show that a street connection is not possible. The applicant must show why the environmental or topographic constraint precludes some reasonable street connection.
4. Proposed streets or street extensions shall be located to provide direct access to existing or planned commercial services and other neighborhood facilities, such as schools, shopping areas and parks.
5. Exceptions to the above standards may be granted when an access way is provided at or near mid-block, in conformance with the provisions of Section 3.1.300.A. Exceptions may also be granted for topography, existing developments and natural resources.
J. Sidewalks, Planter Strips, Bicycle Lanes. Sidewalks, planter strips, and bicycle lanes shall be installed in conformance with the standards in Table 3.4.100, applicable provisions of the Transportation System Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, and adopted street plans. Maintenance of sidewalks, curbs, and planter strips is the continuing obligation of the adjacent property owner.
K. Intersection Angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at an angle as near to a right angle as practicable, except where topography requires a lesser angle or where a reduced angle is necessary to provide an open space, pocket park, common area or similar neighborhood amenity. In addition, the following standards shall apply:
1. Streets shall have at least 25 feet of tangent adjacent to the right-of-way intersection unless topography requires a lesser distance;
2. Intersections which are not at right angles shall have a minimum corner radius of 20 feet along the right-of-way lines of the acute angle; and
3. Right-of-way lines at intersection with arterial streets shall have a corner radius of not less than 20 feet.

3.5.100  Purpose, Scope and Applicability
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide planning and design standards for stormwater management within the City. The primary intent of this chapter is to provide standards for effective and cost efficient stormwater management. Stormwater management is accomplished through a combination of design standards reflecting a more accurate representation of natural climatic, hydraulic and geologic conditions. Included in this chapter are stormwater detention criteria for development, grading and drainage plan requirements, landscaping criteria, street, curb and sidewalk designs. These are designed to keep all precipitation from each lot contained upon that lot.
Important cross reference to other standards: The following code chapters are to be cross referenced to assess impacts of the provisions of this chapter; Chapter 3.1, Chapter 3.2, Chapter 3.3, Chapter 3.4, Chapter 3.6, Chapter 4.1, Chapter 4.2 and Chapter 5.1.
B. Applicability. Where storm sewer infrastructure is currently available or unless otherwise provided, the standard specifications for construction or reconstruction of stormwater management facilities, utilities and other public improvements within the City shall occur in accordance with the standards of this chapter. This chapter applies to development on or within public properties and rights-of-way and privately owned properties.
C. Standard Specifications. The City Manager or their designee shall establish standard construction specifications consistent with the design standards of this Chapter and application of accepted engineering, landscape architecture, hydraulic and geologic principles. They are incorporated in this code by reference.
D. Conditions of Development Approval. Development may occur when stormwater management criteria are met or guaranteed, in conformance with the provisions of this Code. Improvements required as a condition of development approval shall be roughly proportional to the impact of development. Findings in the development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are roughly proportional to the impact.
City of Boardman Development Code 3.5.1
City of Boardman October, 2002
3.5.200  Detention Criteria and Requirements
A. Purpose. Detention of stormwater collected from impervious surfaces on a given property, or within a public right-of-way, is essential to the management of stormwater within the City of Boardman. Each lot will retain all precipitation, which falls upon the lot, within the confines of the lot. In the case of public facilities, stormwater will be retained within the public right-of-way. This section of Chapter 3.5 is to identify the detention of stormwater based upon the Oregon Department of Transportation Hydraulic Manual for Zone 13. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 100 year  24-hour isopluvial maps and data were reviewed for applicability. Soils permeability rates from National Resource Conservation Service were also reviewed and assessed to determine the most appropriate data to use in the construction detention volumes of Table 3.5.100C. The Zone 13 Intensity, Duration and Frequency curves, which are the most conservative for the 100-year storm event, at 0.93/hour for 1 hour, were used in development of Table 3.5.100C and the criteria set in this chapter. All detention values are based upon retention of 100% of the precipitation volumes derived from the data contained in the Oregon Department of Transportation Hydraulic Manual curves for Zone 13.
B. Public Rights-Of-Way. Detention of all of the minimum stormwater detention volumes listed in Table 3.5.100C shall be applicable to the design and development of stormwater detention from all impervious surfaces within a public right-of-way.
C. Lot Development. Detention of all of the minimum stormwater detention volumes listed in Table 3.5.100C shall be applicable to the design and development of stormwater detention from all impervious surfaces located on any lot within the City.

D. Building Drains. Impervious surface drainage from building roofs shall be diverted to detention area(s) on the ground surface by use of downspouts, or other method of vertical conveyance, to a splash pad or other method of horizontal conveyance preventing sub-surface injection of water, which would require registry as an Underground Injection Control well as defined in Oregon Administrative Rule Chapter 340 Division 44.
E. Methods of Detention. Collected stormwater can be stored in a detention method capable of holding the entire volume, for the corresponding impervious surface area, listed in Table 3.5.100C. These detention facilities may be constructed ponds, may be lined, may be constructed bio-swales or may be accomplished through grading, drainage and landscaping techniques set forth in Section 3.5.200. Detention facilities shall have no outlet or receiving stream discharge and must be open to allow for evaporative and permeability losses of the detained stormwater. In the case of constructed decorative ponds, permeability loss requirement may be waived; however evaporative loss must be maintained. Methods of detention, other than mentioned in this section, may be considered for approval.
F. Variance from Table 3.5.100C. Variance from Table 3.5.100C will be considered with the following information submitted for review and approval as a Class A Variance defined in 5.1.300 (F). all variance requests must submit;
1) Site specific permeability data credibly indicating permeability rates higher than those used in the development of Table 3.5.100C;
2) Site specific data of more exact build out impervious area square footages less than the 1,000 square foot increments provided in the tables, and which are calculated in the methods used in the development of Table 3.5.100C;
3) Specific data on permeability rates of alternate paving methods allowing for full or partial permeability of the paving method to be credited as non-impervious surface;
4) Evidence the methods proposed are not classified as a Class V injection system by Oregon Administrative Rule Chapter 340 Division 44;
3.5.300  Grading and Drainage
A. Purpose. The Grading and Drainage for any particular development is an essential function for review and approval. The method of grading to provide drainage, which meets the intent of the stormwater management strategy and wind erosion abatement requirements of the City, will require significant cooperation between City staff and the developer. Minimal grading and surface disturbance from existing topography is generally the best strategic approach to stormwater management and wind erosion concerns within the City of Boardman. However, to accommodate other provisions within the zoning and development codes, to allow for placement of utility and transportation infrastructure, and to allow for effective stormwater management, grading and drainage must be assessed and a plan to manage stormwater and wind erosion shall be developed. This plan shall be developed to negate or minimize impacts from the development during construction and long term operation and occupancy of the development.
B. Public Infrastructure and Rights-Of-Way. Grading plans for public and utility infrastructure shall include topographical information of existing property and a planned topographical profile at the completion of the development. The plan shall address how the provisions of section 3.5.100 will be included in the final topographical profile, as these provisions may require altering existing topography to meet the criteria. Creating the maximum drainage areas of 3,500 square feet impervious surface, may require grading to meet a rolling topography or some level of terracing to maintain the maximum areas of drainage.
City of Boardman Development Code 3.5.3
City of Boardman October, 2002
3.5.300  Grading and Drainage (continued)
C. Lot Development. Lot development shall submit a grading and drainage plan that meets the provisions of Section 3.5.100 based upon the projected total of impervious surface of the lot at build out. This grading and drainage can be incorporated into the landscape plans required in Section 4.2.500 (5). Stormwater detention areas and sizes shall be identified in this plan. The total detention area on a lot shall be equal to or greater than the requirements in Table 3.5.100C. The detention area(s) can be singular in nature or numerous smaller areas can be created to meet the total detention volume requirements. The grading and drainage plans shall indicate how storm water shall be conveyed to the areas of detention and the areas of detention shall be located to accommodate the proportional amount of impervious surface which is drained to any detention area.
D. Changes in Impervious Surface Areas. Whenever there is a proposed increase in the amount of impervious surface area, a plan for grading, drainage and detention shall be submitted for review and approval. This review is to assure the provisions for detention volumes contained in Table 3.5.100C are met.
E. Changes In Grading or Drainage. When there is a proposed change to the grading and drainage of an existing development, a plan shall be submitted for review and approval to assure compliance with the detention provisions contained with Table 3.5.100C. Graded depressions for the detention of stormwater shall not be filled or altered without submission of a plan for approval.
F. Variance From Grading and Drainage Requirements. Variance from the grading and drainage requirements will be considered when conditions prevent meeting the criteria set forth in this section. The following conditions will be cause for consideration of alternatives from the standards in this section as a Class A Variance;
1) Topographical constraints do not allow for the requirements of this section to met; or
2) Geological conditions prevent meeting the criteria in this section; or
3) Other physical constraints preventing the adherence to the criteria of this section.
At a minimum, variance from the grading and drainage plan will be conditioned upon the total amount of detention area being increased to the corresponding impervious surface area detention requirements set in Table 3.5.100C.
3.5.400  Landscaping Requirements
A. Purpose. The purpose of these landscaping requirements is to provide an effective treatment barrier for protection of groundwater in areas of stormwater detention. This treatment barrier is comprised of vegetative materials to act as a bio-filter for the purpose of filtering stormwater contaminants.
B. Landscape Area Standards. The landscape area percentages in Section 3.2.200 (C) and 3.2.200 (E) (2) of this code shall be in effect unless the following conditions are experienced; in which case the detention area criteria contained in Table 3.5.100C will be followed;
1) The percentage of landscape area is not sufficient to provide adequate detention of stormwater on-site,
2) Site specific permeability rates are not adequate to allow for detention and drainage of collected stormwater;
3) Impervious surface area creates detention volumes greater than the 5% requirement for parking lot landscaping.
City of Boardman Development Code 3.5.4
City of Boardman October, 2002
3.5.400  Landscaping Requirements (continued)
C. Landscape Materials. Landscape materials in detention areas shall be turf grasses or drought tolerant grasses providing a root system to act as a bio filter for any water, which percolates into the soils. Shallow rooting shrubbery, shade trees, groundcover plants and decorative plants, which do not interfere with utilities, may also be used on individual lot development. Shade trees with turf grass cover between them may be used in large detention areas on individual lot developments. Landscaping within the right-ofway shall be turf and drought tolerant grasses, shallow rooting shrubbery, ground cover plants and decorative plants with shallow rooting to prevent damage to utilities routed within the right-of-way.
D. Landscape Maintenance. The grasses in the detention areas shall be mowed periodically and shall be irrigated to maintain plant health. Landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with the landscaping requirements outlined in Section 3.2.200.
E. Detention Area Landscape Fertilization. The detention areas shall not be fertilized.
F. Variance To Landscape Requirements. Variance from the landscape requirements will be considered, as a Class A Variance, when conditions prevent meeting the criteria set forth in this section. A variance request shall be accompanied by the following information for review and subsequent action;
1) The physical reason the criteria can not be met;
2) A description of the alternate method being proposed; and
3) How the alternate method meets the purpose of Section 3.5.300, stormwater management strategies of the City;
4) Other information pertinent to the allowance of variance from the standards set in this section.
3.5.500  Curb and Sidewalk Design
A. Purpose. In order to facilitate the stormwater management strategies being defined within this chapter of the zoning codes the design of streets, curbs and sidewalks have been designed, approved and included in construction standards. The design standards being identified in this section show the design characteristics to allow for the standards defined in this chapter.
B. Curb Standards. The curb designs outlined in this section are consistent with the street design standards of the Transportation System Plan for Local Streets, Neighborhood Collectors, Collectors and Arterial streets. These curb designs will apply to all new construction or reconstruction of streets as classified in the Transportation System Plan.
1) Residential Zones. Curbs within the residential areas on streets classified as Local or Neighborhood Collector shall be a mountable face curb constructed of concrete as set in City construction standards.
2) All Other Zones. Curbs will be a square face curb and will be constructed of concrete as set in City construction standards.
3) Curb Openings. Curb openings will be constructed in accordance with City construction standards and will be spaced at the frequencies listed in Table 3.5.400B. This table is to indicate the distance between curb openings while maintaining the maximum impervious area of 3,500 square feet and a minimum spacing for aesthetics and safety when following prescribed street standards.

3.7.400.  Authorization, Findings, Purpose and Objectives
A) AUTHORIZATION
The State of Oregon has in the Oregon Constitution, Article XI Section 2 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry in accordance with the approved Boardman Charter of 1985.
B) FINDINGS OF FACT
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Boardman are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
C) STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
(1) To project human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.1
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.400.  Authorization, Findings, Purpose and Objectives
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and,
(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.
D) METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

3.7.420  General Provisions (continued)
can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
3.7.430 - Administration
A) ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
1) Development Permit Required

b) Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.
c) Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 5.3(1) are met.
2) Use of Other Base Flood Data (In A and V Zones)
a) When base flood elevation data has not been provided (A and V Zones) in accordance with Section 3.7.430 (C)(2), BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, the city manager or their designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Sections 3.7.450(B), SPECIFIC STANDARDS, and 3.7.430 (C)(2) FLOODWAYS.
b) In a letter dated September 6, 2007, from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering and Construction Division, the calculated 1% chance exceedance stage at river mile 270.3 based on most recent data available to USACE is 269.7 NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum).
c) Qualified survey information showing elevations above 269.7 feet NGVD or 273.01 feet NAVD (North American Vertical Datum) will be considered by the city to begin the amendment process to amend the Federal Emergency Management Administration FIRM (flood insurance rate map) to reflect specific data and remove the area from the Zone A flood zone.
3) Information to be Obtained and Maintained
a) Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or required as in Section 4.3-2, obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
b) For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or as required in Section 4.3-2:
(i) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean seal level), and
(ii) Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 4.1-2(3).
c) Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.
4) Alteration of Watercourses
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.8
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.430  Administration (continued)
a) Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Land Conservation and Development prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
b) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
5) Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries
Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 4.4.
NOTE: If you do not include Section 4.4 (Variance Procedure), end the above sentence after the word interpretation, and add the following sentence: such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59-76).
3.7.440.  Variance Procedure
A) Appeal Board
1) The Boardman City Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
2) The Boardman City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City of Boardman in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Boardman City Council, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Morrow County District Court.
4) In passing upon such applications, the Boardman City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Development Code Chapter, and:
a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area;
i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.9
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.440 - Variance Procedure (continued)
j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
5) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 3.7.440 (4) and the purposes of this ordinance, the Boardman City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
6) The City Clerk and/or Community Development Department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B) Conditions for Variances
1) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xi) in Section 4.4-1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Statewide Inventory of Historic Propertries, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
3) Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 4.1-4(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
7) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except 4.4-2(1), and otherwise complies with Sections 5.1-1 and 5.1-2 of the GENERAL STANDARDS.
8) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.10
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450  Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A) GENERAL STANDARDS
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:
1) Anchoring
a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
b) All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (Reference FEMAs Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas guidebook for additional techniques).
2) AH Zone Drainage
Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away form proposed structures.
3) Construction Materials and Methods
a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
c) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
4) Utilities
a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
b) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
c) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
5) Subdivision Proposals
a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;

City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450 - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (continued)
d) Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less).
6) Review of Building Permits
Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (Section 4.3-2), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.
B) SPECIFIC STANDARDS
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided (Zones A1-30, AH, and AE) as set forth in Section 3.2, BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD or Section 4.3-2, Use of Other Base Flood Data (In A and V Zones), the following provisions are required:
1) Residential Construction
a) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation.
b) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
2) Nonresidential Construction
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at or above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a) Be flood proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
b)Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.12
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450 - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (continued)
c) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 4.3-3(2);
d) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in 5.2-1(2);
e) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g. a building floodproofed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below.
3) Manufactured Homes
(a) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites:
(i) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or
(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
(b) Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the communitys FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions be elevated so that either:
(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation, or
(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
4) Recreational Vehicles

City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.13
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450 - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (continued)
C) BEFORE REGULATORY FLOODWAY
In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the communitys FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
D) FLOODWAYS
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 3.2 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) If Section 5.4(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 5.0, PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
E) STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING AREAS (AO ZONES)
Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from 1 to 3 feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:
(1) New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
(2) New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:
(i) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
(ii) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely flood proofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.14
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450 - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (continued)
of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in section 5.2-2(3).
(3) Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(4) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO Zones on the communitys FIRM either:
(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or
(iii) Meet the requirements of 5.5 above and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.
F) COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 3.2 are Coastal High Hazard Areas, designated as Zones V1-V30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this ordinance, the following provisions shall also apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:
(i) The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and
(ii) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in and given year (100-year mean recurrence interval);
(2) A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of (i) and (ii) of this Section.
(3) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V1-30, VE, and V, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The local administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.
(4) All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.
(5) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more
City of Boardman Development Code Page 3.7.15
City of Boardman December 4, 2007
3.7.450 - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction (continued)
than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:
a) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
b) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).
(6) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.
(7) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings.
(8) Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage.
(9) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM on sites:
a) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
b) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
c) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or
d) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;
meet the standards of paragraphs 5.6(1) through (8) of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the FIRM meet the requirements of Section 5.2-3.
(10) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the communitys FIRM either:
a) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or
c) Meet the requirements of Section 4.1-1(Permitting requirements) and paragraphs 5.6(1) through (8) of this section.
G) CRITICAL FACILITY

4.1.100 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard decision-making procedures that will enable the City, the applicant, and the public to reasonably review applications and participate in the local decision-making process in a timely and effective way.
4.1.200 Description of Permit/Decision-Making Procedures
All land use and development permit applications, except building permits, shall be decided by using the procedures contained in this Chapter. General provisions for all permits are contained in Section 4.1.700. Specific procedures for certain types of permits are contained in Section 4.1.200 through 4.1.600. The procedure type assigned to each permit governs the decision-making process for that permit. There are four types of permit/decision-making procedures: Type I, II, III, and IV. These procedures are described in subsections A-D below. In addition, Table 4.1.200 lists all of the Citys land use and development applications and their required permit procedure(s).
A. Type I Procedure (Ministerial). Type I decisions are made by the City Manager or his/her designee without public notice and without a public hearing. The Type I procedure is used when there are clear and objective approval criteria, and applies city standards and criteria that require no use of discretion;
B. Type II Procedure (Administrative). Type II decisions are made by the City Manager or his/her designee with public notice, and an opportunity for a public hearing if appealed. The appeal of a Type II decision is heard by the Planning Commission;
C. Type III Procedure (Quasi-Judicial). Type III decisions are made by the Planning Commission after a public hearing, with appeals heard by the City Council. Type III decisions generally use discretionary approval criteria;

City of Boardman August 15, 2006
4.1.200 Description of Permit/Decision-making Procedures (continued)
D. Type IV Procedure (Legislative). Type IV procedures apply to legislative matters. Legislative matters involve the creation, revision, or large-scale implementation of public policy (e.g., adoption of land use regulations, zone changes, and comprehensive plan amendments which apply to entire districts). Type IV matters are considered initially by the Planning Commission with final decisions made by the City Council.

4.3.110 General Requirements
A. Subdivision and Partition Approval Through Two-step Process. Applications for subdivision or partition approval shall be processed through a two-step process: the preliminary plat and the final plat.
1. The preliminary plat shall be approved before the final plat can be submitted for approval consideration; and
2. The final plat shall include all conditions of approval of the preliminary plat.
B. Compliance With ORS Chapter 92. All subdivision and partition proposals shall be in conformance to state regulations set forth in Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) Chapter 92, Subdivisions and Partitions.
C. Future Re-division Plan. When subdividing or partitioning tracts into large lots (i.e., greater than two times or 200 percent the minimum lot size allowed by the underlying land use district), the City shall require that the lots be of such size, shape, and orientation as to facilitate future re-division in accordance with the requirements of the land use district and this Code. A re-division plan shall be submitted which identifies:
1. Potential future lot division(s) in conformance with the housing and density standards of Chapter 2;
2. Potential street right-of-way alignments to serve future development of the property and connect to adjacent properties, including existing or planned rights-of-way.
3. A disclaimer that the plan is a conceptual plan intended to show potential future development. It shall not be binding on the City or property owners, except as may be required through conditions of land division approval. For example, dedication and improvement of rights-of-way within the future plan area may be required to provide needed secondary access and circulation.
D. Lot Size Averaging, Single family residential lot size may be averaged to allow lots less than the minimum lot size in the Residential district, as long as the average area for all lots is not less than allowed by the district. No lot created under this provision shall be less than 50% of the minimum lot size allowed in the underlying district. For example, if the minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet, one way for three lots to be created from a 15,000 square foot parcel are: 4,000 square feet, 5,000 square feet, and 6,000 square feet.
E. Temporary Sales Office. A temporary sales office in conjunction with a subdivision may be approved as set forth in Chapter 2.1.190, Special Standards for Certain Uses.
F. Need for Adequate Utilities. All lots created through land division shall have adequate public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to prevent or minimize flood damage to the extent practicable.
G. Need for Adequate Drainage. All subdivision and partition proposals shall have adequate surface water drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Water quality or quantity control improvements may be required.

4.3.110 General Requirements (continued)
H. Floodplain, Park, and Open Space Dedications. Where land filling and/or development is allowed within or adjacent to the 100-year flood plain outside the zero-foot rise flood plain, and the Comprehensive Plan designates the subject flood plain for park, open space, or trail use, the City may require the dedication of sufficient open land area for a greenway adjoining or within the flood plain. When practicable, this area shall include portions at a suitable elevation for the construction of a pedestrian/bicycle pathway within the flood plain in accordance with the Citys adopted trails plan or pedestrian and bikeway plans, as applicable. The City shall evaluate individual development proposals and determine whether the dedication of land is justified based on the developments impact to the park and/or trail system, consistent with Chapter 3.4, and Section 3.4.000.D in particular.
I. Double Frontage Lots. The creation of double frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible.
4.3.120 Approvals Process
A. Review of Preliminary Plat. Review of a preliminary plat with 2 or 3 lots (partition) shall be processed by means of a Type II procedure, as governed by Section 4.1.400. Preliminary plats with more than 3 lots (subdivision) shall be processed with a Type III procedure under Section 4.1.500. All preliminary plats shall be reviewed using approval criteria contained in Section 4.3.140. An application for subdivision may be reviewed concurrently with an application for a Master Planned Development under Chapter 4.5.
B. Review of Final Plat. Review of a final plat for a subdivision or partition shall be processed by means of a Type I procedure under Section 4.1.300, using the approval criteria in Section 4.3.160.
C. Preliminary Plat Approval Period. Preliminary plat approval shall be effective for a period of three (3) years from the date of approval. The preliminary plat shall lapse if a final plat has not been submitted within a two (2)-year period.
D. Modifications and Extensions. The applicant may request changes to the approved preliminary plat or conditions of approval following the procedures and criteria provided in Chapter 4.6 - Modifications. The City Manager or his/her designee shall, upon written request by the applicant and payment of the required fee, grant one extension of the approval period not to exceed one year; provided that:
1. Any changes to the preliminary plat follow the procedures in Chapter 4.6;
2. The applicant has submitted written intent to file a final plat within the one-year extension period;
3. An extension of time will not prevent the lawful development of abutting properties;

Chapter 5.0 - Exceptions to Code Standards
5.0 - Introduction
5.1 - Variances
5.2 - Non-Conforming Uses and Developments
5.0 Introduction
This Chapter provides standards and procedures for variances and non-conforming situations (i.e., existing uses or development that do not comply with the Code). This code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation. The Citys varied geography and complexities of land development require flexibility. Chapter 5 provides that flexibility, while maintaining the purposes and intent of the Code. The variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other provisions of the Code. The standards for non-conforming uses and development are intended to provide some relief from code requirements for older developments that do not comply.

Chapter 5.1 - Variances
Sections:
5.1.100 - Purpose
5.1.200 - Class A Variance
5.1.300 - Class B Variance
5.1.400 - Class C Variance
5.1.500 - Variance Application and Appeals
5.1.100 Purpose
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide flexibility to development standards, in recognition of the complexity and wide variation of site development opportunities and constraints. The variance procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met. Because some variances are granted using clear and objective standards, they can be granted by means of a Type I procedure. Other variances, as identified below, require a Type II or III procedure because they involve discretionary decision-making.
5.1.200 Class A Variances
A. Class A variances. The following variances are reviewed using a Type I procedure, as governed by Chapter 4.1, using the approval criteria in Subsection B, below:
1. Front yard setbacks. Up to a 10 percent change to the front yard setback standard in the base land use district.
2. Interior setbacks. Up to a 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side and rear yard setbacks required in the base land use district.
3. Lot coverage. Up to 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage permitted in the base land use district .
4. Landscape area. Up to 10 percent reduction in required landscape area (overall area or interior parking lot landscape area).
B. Class A variance approval criteria. A Class A Variance shall be granted if the applicant demonstrates compliance with all of the following criteria:
1. The variance requested is required due to the lot configuration, or other conditions of the site;
2. The variance does not result in the removal of trees, or it is proposed in order to preserve trees, if trees are present in the development area;
3. The variance will not result in violation(s) of Chapter 3, or other design standards.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 5.1.1
City of Boardman October 2002
5.1.300 Class B Variances
Due to their discretionary nature, the following types of variances shall be reviewed using a Type II procedure, in accordance with Chapter 4.1:
A. Variance to Vehicular Access and Circulation Standards (Chapter 3.1). Where vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to Code standards within a particular parcel, shared access with an adjoining property shall be considered. If shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible, the City may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding the following:
1. There is not adequate physical space for shared access, or the owners of abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement;
2. There are no other alternative access points on the street in question or from another street;
3. The access separation requirements cannot be met;
4. The request is the minimum adjustment required to provide adequate access;
5. The approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe access; and
6. The visual clearance requirements of Chapter 3.1 will be met.
B. Variance to Street Tree Requirements (Chapter 3.2). The City may approve, or approve with conditions, a request for a variance to the street tree requirements in Chapter 3.2, after finding the following:
1. Installation of the tree would interfere with existing utility lines; or
2. The tree would cause visual clearance problems; or
3. There is not adequate space in which to plant a street tree; and
4. Replacement landscaping is provided elsewhere on the site (e.g., parking lot area trees).
C. Variance to Maximum or Minimum Yard Setbacks to Reduce Tree Removal or Impacts to Wetlands (Chapters 2 and 3.2). The City may grant a variance to the applicable setback requirements of this Code for the purpose of preserving a tree or trees on the site of proposed development or avoiding wetland impacts. The modification shall not be more than is necessary for the preservation of trees on the site.
D. Variances to Transportation Improvement Requirements (Chapter 3.4.100). The City may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a variance to the transportation improvement standards of Chapter 3.4.1, based on the criteria for granting variances provided in Section 3.4.100.B. When a variance request cannot be supported by the provisions of that Chapter, then the request shall be reviewed as a Class C variance.
5.1.400 Class C Variances
Due to their discretionary nature and review of special circumstances, the variances in this subsection require a Type III process, as described in Section 5.1.400.C.
City of Boardman Development Code Page 5.1.2
City of Boardman October 2002
5.1.400 Class C Variances (continued)
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide standards for variances which exceed the Class A and Class B variance criteria in Sections 5.1.200 and 5.1.300. Class C variances may be granted if the applicant shows that, owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific property, the literal application of the standards of the applicable land use district would create a hardship to development which is peculiar to the lot size or shape, topography, sensitive lands (Chapter 3.7), or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control, and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity (e.g., the same land use district); except that no variances to permitted uses or prohibited uses shall be granted.
B. Applicability.
1. The variance standards are intended to apply to individual platted and recorded lots only.
2. An applicant who proposes to vary a specification standard for lots not yet created through a land division process may not utilize the Class C variance procedure.
3. A variance shall not be approved which would vary the permitted uses or prohibited uses of a land use district (Chapter 2).
4. Variance to Parking Standards (Chapter 3.3).
a. The City may approve variances to the minimum or maximum standards for off-street parking in Section 3.3.100 upon finding all of the following:
(1) The individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity;
(2) The need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met through shared parking with adjacent or nearby uses; and
(3) All other parking design and building orientation standards are met, in conformance with the standards in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.
b. The City may approve a reduction of required bicycle parking per Section 3.3.200, if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking.
c. The City may allow a reduction in the amount of vehicle stacking area required for drive-through facilities if such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the size and location of the development, limited services available and other pertinent factors.
C. Approvals Process and Criteria.
1. Class C variances shall be processed using a Type III procedure, as governed by Section 4.1.500, using the approval criteria in subsection 2, below. In addition to the application requirements contained in Section 4.1.500, the applicant shall provide a written narrative or letter describing his/her reasoning for the variance, why it is required, alternatives considered, and compliance with the criteria in subsection 2.
2. The City shall approve, or approve with conditions, an application for a variance based on finding that all of the following criteria are satisfied:
a. The proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this Code, to any other applicable policies and standards, and to other properties in the same land use district or vicinity;
City of Boardman Development Code Page 5.1.3
City of Boardman October 2002
5.1.400 Class C Variances (continued)
b. A hardship to development exists which is peculiar to the lot size or shape, topography, sensitive lands, or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control, and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity (e.g., the same land use district);
c. The use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title, and City standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting reasonable economic use of the land;
d. Existing physical and natural systems, such as, but not limited to, traffic, drainage, natural resources, and parks, will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject Code standard;
e. The hardship is not self-imposed; and
f. The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship.
5.1.500 Variance Application and Appeals
The variance application shall conform to the requirements for Type I, II, or II applications (Sections 4.1.300, 4.1.400, 4.1.500). In addition, the applicant shall provide a narrative or letter explaining the reason for his/her request, alternatives considered, and why the subject standard cannot be met without the variance. Appeals to variance decisions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4.1.
