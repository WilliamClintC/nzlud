Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 124-17. Identification.
§ 124-18. Description of floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any area of the City of Pottsville
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated November 19, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by the City of Pottsville and
declared to be part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has
been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zone A in the FIS
for which no one-hundred-year flood elevations have been provided.

Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the City Planning Commission and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
When available, information from other federal, state, and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the one-hundred-year
elevation, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the one-hundred-year elevation shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
D. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the City.
A. The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the City
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). Additionally, as soon as practicable, but
not later than six months after the date such information becomes
available, a community shall notify the FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
B. Technical or scientific data shall be submitted to FEMA for a letter of
map revision (LOMR) within six months of the completion of any new
construction, development, or other activity resulting in the BFE.

shall be made on the appropriate form to the City Health Officer, who will
review each application to determine whether the applicant, by virtue of
medical or physical necessity, requires a parking space in close proximity
to his or her residence so as to make a significant improvement in the
quality of life of said applicant or a person in the applicant's immediate
family with whom he or she resides and for whom the applicant is the
primary care provider. If the City Health Officer approves, he shall forward
the application to the Bureau of Police, who will review each application
approved by the City Health Officer to determine if the physical area
in which the requested handicapped parking space sign is to be placed
requires the placement by considering the physical circumstances of the
area and the lack of alternative parking available. The City Health Officer
and the Bureau of Police will conduct a review of each handicapped parking
space sign erected under the provisions of this chapter on or about the
date of the yearly renewal, to determine if the circumstances under which
the sign was originally erected still exist. The City Health Officer or the
Chief of Police may, whenever he reasonably believes the placement of the
handicapped parking space sign is inappropriate or unnecessary, deny the
application or, if after review determines circumstances no longer exist
which make the handicapped parking sign appropriate or necessary, he may
direct the Street Department to remove the sign.

If the sign is approved for installation, the applicant shall pay $100 to cover
the cost of labor and materials.

parking space created hereunder.
§ 133-4. Other parking regulations. [Added 4-9-2012 by Ord. No.

the block, and availability of off-street parking and may further restrict
the number of handicapped parking spaces to maintain an adequate
number of unregulated parking spaces, as they deem appropriate.
D. Existing handicapped parking spaces. Handicapped parking spaces in
excess of the limitations set forth in this section and existing on the
effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to remain in place,
subject to the removal if a significant parking hardship in the
neighborhood exists or if the annual reporting requirement is not met.
A. Generally. For a single application for a handicapped parking space,
sign placements will be positioned as close as possible to the place of
residence of the applicant as the street design permits. In the event
more than the permissible number of handicapped parking spaces are
requested on a one- or two-way roadway, the HP spaces may be located
or relocated in the center of the block or otherwise adequately
positioned to collectively reflect, as a whole, the needs of all applicants,
as determined by the Police Department.
B. Authority to post. The Superintendent of Streets will direct all postings,
sign removals and replacements of handicapped parking spaces in
accordance with Department rules and regulations.
C. Disputes regarding sign placement. The Police Department shall be
responsible for investigating City and citizen complaints regarding the
placement of handicapped parking signs. The Police Department shall
require all complaints be in writing and shall conduct an investigation
of the complaint within 90 calendar days. Upon conducting an
investigation, the Police Department shall report the complaint, its

the right to request that an applicant submit medical records, which
evidence the applicant's ongoing disability. In January of each year, the
Health Office shall mail (via regular first class mail) each applicant (and
applicants under prior rules and regulations) the renewal application. If the
applicant fails to submit the renewal application and fee by March 15 of
that year or the applicant is no longer eligible for a handicapped parking
space, the Health Officer will inform the Superintendent of Streets the
handicapped parking space should be removed.
§ 133-8. Registration plates and placards. [Added 4-9-2012 by Ord.
No. 815]
The applicant shall be solely responsible for the cost of any and all staterelated
applications, filings, and documentation required for a placard or
registration plate. The placard or registration plate must be displayed while
the vehicle is parked in a public designated HP space.
§ 133-9. False statements; violations and penalties. [Added

of obtaining a handicapped parking space. Any person who violates this
provision shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.

§ 171-1. Purpose.
Lack of maintenance of properties, littering, improper storage of trash and
rubbish, storage of inoperable/nonregistered vehicles, vendor operations
without permits and accumulation of snow and ice are costly problems that
contribute to the deterioration of property values and general disorder in
a community. These problems degrade the physical appearance of the City
which reduces business and tax revenue, inhibiting economic development.
The quality of life and community pride of the citizens of Pottsville are
negatively impacted by the occurrences and existence of these activities.
Recognizing these are community problems, the purpose of this chapter is
to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the City by helping to
create a clean environment for the citizens of Pottsville.

§ 175-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to help protect the health, safety and welfare
of the citizens by preventing blight, protecting property values and
neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and maintenance of nuisances
and to ensure the safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial
and industrial buildings. It is the intent of this chapter to address homes and
buildings that have become vacant, abandoned, or otherwise unsupervised
thereby having a negative impact on surrounding properties and
neighborhoods. Vacant and abandoned homes create an increased instance
of unsecured or open doors and windows, broken water pipes, flooded
basements, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds,
shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping, and rodent and vermin activity at
vacant structures. Such neglect devalues properties and causes
deterioration in neighborhoods and industrial and commercial areas. It is
important for the City to be able to contact owners of vacant properties for
property maintenance, utility shutoff, fire safety, and police reasons.
§ 175-2. Scope.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all existing residential,
commercial, and industrial structures. This chapter does not relieve an
owner from compliance with all other City ordinances, codes, rules,
regulations, and state law.

City that the residential rental unit and/or the building in which it is located

of compliance indicates that the residential rental unit did not have any
dangerous conditions as of the date of the inspection. However, neither the

impose any liability upon the City for any errors or omissions which resulted
in the issuance of such certificate, nor shall the City bear any liability not

accomplish the repairs, the Code Enforcement Officer or designee shall
issue a new notice of noncompliance, in accordance with § 176-9 of this
article. Further, the owner shall pay a reinspection fee in an amount
equal to the initial application fee as set forth in § 176-11 of this article.

violations, has failed to come into compliance with the code, ordinance
or law which the owner violated within such time as the Code

General Provisions
§ 193-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Pottsville
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 193-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 193-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 193-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the Commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using
systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1)
infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices
and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of
predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
§ 193-1 SPACE HEATERS § 193-3
191:311
§ 193-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,111 and/or the Act
of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended,
the Storm Water Management Act.
§ 193-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 193-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 193-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the
municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

§ 193-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 193-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 193-10. Waivers.
A. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 193-10B and C.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that the modifications will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Cost or
financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may
be considered if an alternative standard or approach will provide equal
or better achievement of the purpose of the chapter. A request for
modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the chapter involved
and the proposed modification.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality unless that action is approved in advance
by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated
county conservation district.

and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
§ 193-11 SPACE HEATERS § 193-11

DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the one-hundred-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the
boundary of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance
studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies
have defined the boundary of the one-hundred-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends
from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
§ 193-11 POTTSVILLE CODE § 193-11
191:316
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and

natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on
the site where it is generated.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Infiltration rates of soils vary
widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D)
according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare
soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group
classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be
identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local
NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious
as the HSG varies from A to D. (NOTE: See § 196-36A and B.)
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor

are not counted as impervious areas if they do not prevent infiltration.
KARST  A type of topography or landscape characterized by surface
depressions, sinkholes, rock pinnacles/uneven bedrock surface,
underground drainage, and caves. Karst is formed on Schuylkillate
rocks, such as limestone or dolomite.
LAND DEVELOPMENT (DEVELOPMENT)  Inclusive of any or all of
the following meanings:
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and
small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of
rainwater. LID can be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and
The improvement of one lot or two or more contiguous lots, tracts,
or parcels of land for any purpose involving a) a group of two or
more buildings or b) the division or allocation of land or space
between or among two or more existing or prospective occupants
by means of, or for the purpose of, streets, common areas,
leaseholds, condominiums, building groups, or other features;

revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate,
filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely
on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses
stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features
located on site.

earth disturbance subject to regulation under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92a,
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, or the Clean Streams Law.113
RETENTION VOLUME/REMOVED RUNOFF  The volume of runoff
that is captured and not released directly into the surface waters of this
commonwealth during or after a storm event.
RETURN PERIOD  The average interval, in years, within which a
storm event of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time.
For example, the twenty-five-year return period rainfall would be
expected to occur on average once every 25 years; or stated in another
way, the probability of a twenty-five-year storm occurring in any one
year is 0.04 (i.e., a four-percent chance).
RIPARIAN BUFFER  A permanent area of trees and shrubs located
adjacent to streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands.

Program Manual (E&S Manual) (NOTE: See § 196-36D.), No.
363-2134-008, as amended and updated.
E. Impervious areas:
(1) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
(2) For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(3) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter, except that the volume controls in § 193-14 and the peak
rate controls of § 193-15 do not need to be retrofitted to existing

Best Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual) (NOTE: See
§ 196-36C.). If methods other than green infrastructure and LID
methods are proposed to achieve the volume and rate controls
required under this chapter, the SWM site plan must include a
detailed justification demonstrating that the use of LID and green
infrastructure is not practicable.
H. The design of all facilities over karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize adverse effects.
I. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
J. Normally dry, open-top storage facilities should completely drain both
the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not
less than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design

(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual (NOTE: See
§ 196-36C.) provided below is independent of site conditions and should
be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects
that require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious
surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 193-15, Rate
controls.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm
events. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by
the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for
one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of this section
have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional
controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:

191:324
(1) For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundredyear,
twenty-four-hour storm events, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates.

ARTICLE IV
Stormwater Management (SWM) Site Plan Requirements
§ 193-16. Plan requirements.
The following items shall be included in the SWM site plan.
A. Appropriate sections from the municipality's Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance,119 and other applicable local ordinances, shall
be followed in preparing the SWM site plans. In instances where the
municipality lacks subdivision and land development regulations, the
content of SWM site plans shall follow the county's Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.
B. The municipality shall not approve any SWM site plan that is deficient
in meeting the requirements of this chapter. At its sole discretion and in

Commission deems such extension undesirable for specific reasons of
topography or design.
D. Streets shall be logically related to the topography to produce usable
lots and reasonable grades.
E. Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage through traffic, but
provision for street connections into and from adjacent areas will
generally be required.
F. Proposed streets shall be extended to provide access to adjoining
property where necessary.
G. Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary where lots
in the proposal are large enough to permit resubdivision or if a portion
of the tract is not subdivided.
H. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
traffic street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, rear
service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will
provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with the major street and separation of local and through
traffic.
I. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards contained herein and where, in addition,

street extension into adjoining tracts or when designed as culs-de-sac.
L. New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets, shall
be avoided.
A. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of less than 60º.
B. Multiple intersections involving junction of more than two streets shall
be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such intersections shall be
designed with extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety.
C. Clear sight triangles of 30 feet measured along street lot lines from
their point of junction shall be provided at all intersections, and no
building shall be permitted within such sight triangles.

intersections involving only minor streets, 25 feet for intersections
involving other type streets or such greater radius as is suited to the
specific intersection.
G. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of inadequate
right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in conformance with
Table 1126 will be required.
H. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds 7%, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than
four-percent grades for a distance of 25 feet measured from the nearest

turnaround right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried
to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the
street into the adjoining tract.
A. Lot sizes and dimensions shall be not less than those specified in
Chapter 220, Zoning.
B. Where either or both water supply and sanitary sewage disposal are
provided by individual on-lot facilities and evidence indicates that the
requirements of the Zoning Code are not adequate, the Commission
may require tests, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
State Department of Health, undertaken at the expense of the
developer, to determine the adequacy of the proposed lot size and
existing grade and soil conditions. In all such cases where the tests
indicate a larger lot size to be necessary, the Commission may employ
the services of a registered and qualified independent sanitary engineer
for advice as to the minimum lot size and/or facilities necessary to
prevent unsanitary conditions and hazards to the public health. In such
cases, the cost of retaining the services of a qualified engineer shall be
borne by the developer.
C. Where commercial subdivisions are proposed to be served by either or
both on-lot sanitary sewage disposal and water supply facilities, the lot
area and dimensions required to prevent health hazards shall be
subject to individual review and determination by the Planning
Commission and/or the State Department of Health.

§ 201-41 POTTSVILLE CODE § 201-43

(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.

last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1; the City of Pottsville or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a

paragraph, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the

Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 201-46. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 201-47. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with

E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 201-43B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

§ 201-48. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 201-49. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 201-50. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home. In
case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment
constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person

aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

B. If the license, or any portion thereof, imposed upon any person under
the provisions of this article shall be held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or

not affect or impair the right to impose the license or taxes or the
validity of the license or taxes so imposed upon other persons as herein
provided.

provision of this article, or the application of any provision to any
circumstances, to be illegal or unconstitutional, the other provisions of
this article, or the application of such provision to other circumstances,

provisions had not been included.
D. The taxes assessed under this section shall be in addition to all taxes
levied and collected by the City, County or Commonwealth.
A. The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to accept payment under
protest of the amount of business license claimed by the City in any
case where the taxpayer disputes the validity or amount of the City's
claim for the license. If it is thereafter judicially determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that the City has been overpaid, the amount of
the overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer. The provisions of
this section shall be applicable to cases in which the facts are similar to
those in a case litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction.

with the Tax Administrator. A claim for refund must be filed within three
years of the due date of the return or within one year of payment,

Administrator and must be accompanied by a true copy of the
claimant's federal income tax return. The burden of proof of earning is

Administration and Enforcement
§ 220-25. Permit procedures.
A. Sequence of steps. Under the terms of this chapter, all new
construction, alterations and changes in type of occupancy must be
made in conformance with the requirements contained herein. All
persons desiring to undertake such new construction, alterations or
changes shall conform to the following general procedure as well as to
all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
(1) Application for zoning permit. The applicant applies to the Zoning
Officer for a zoning permit by filling out the appropriate application
and by submitting the required fee. [Amended 12-12-1994 by
Ord. No. 526]
(2) Issuance of zoning permit. If the action proposed in the application
is in accord with the regulations contained in this chapter, a zoning
permit will be issued by the Zoning Officer either on his own
authority or, in certain cases as described in Subsection B below,
after referral to the Zoning Hearing Board or to the Planning
Commission. [Amended 12-12-1994 by Ord. No. 526]
(3) Action in accordance with zoning permit. After receipt of the
zoning permit, the applicant may proceed to undertake the
construction, alteration or change in use permitted by the zoning
permit.
(4) Application for occupancy permit. After completion of the
construction, alteration or change in use and before occupancy
takes place on the premises, the applicant shall apply to the
Building Inspector for an occupancy permit stating that the
completed action is in accord with the zoning permit.
(5) Inspection by Building Inspector. The Building Inspector inspects
the premises and issues an occupancy permit if he finds the action
has occurred in accordance with the zoning permit.
(6) Issuance of occupancy permit. The receipt of the occupancy permit
by the applicant ensures him the right to continue the use as
approved.
B. Zoning permit types. Under the terms of this chapter, five general
classes of zoning permits may be issued under which compliance with
this chapter may occur. Each of these classes required a different
procedural action as described below:
(1) Permitted uses. An application for a zoning permit for a permitted
use in a zoning district requires only the review of the Zoning
Officer, who determines whether the proposed construction,
alteration or change in use is in accordance with the requirements
§ 220-25 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 220-25
210:519
§ 220-26. Zoning Officer. [Amended 1-9-1990 by Ord. No. 425;
12-12-1994 by Ord. No. 527]
of this chapter. The Zoning Officer then either issues or refuses
to issue a zoning permit according to his decision. [Amended
12-12-1994 by Ord. No. 527]
(2) Special uses. An application for a zoning permit for a special use
must be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board and to the Planning
Commission by the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer is not
empowered to make an independent decision on this matter,
although he may submit recommendations to the Zoning Hearing
Board and to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
reviews the application and analyzes the proposed special use to
determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The
Planning Commission then gives its recommendations to the
Zoning Hearing Board which meets and makes a final decision on
the special use. The Zoning Hearing Board then notifies the Zoning
Officer to either issue or refuse a zoning permit accordingly.
[Amended 12-12-1994 by Ord. No. 527]
(3) Zoning permit after appeal. The applicant may appeal to the Board
any action taken by the Zoning Officer by submitting an application
for an appeal to the Zoning Officer and to the Secretary of the
Board within 20 days from the notice of the action of the Zoning
Officer. [Amended 1-9-1990 by Ord. No. 425; 12-12-1994 by
Ord. No. 527]
(4) Permit after a variance request. Where the applicant feels that
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, he may appeal for a
variance by submitting an application requesting such variance to
the Zoning Officer and to the Secretary of the Zoning Hearing
Board. The Board gives notice of the date for a public hearing and
reviews the application. After the public hearing and after reaching
its decision, the Board can order the Zoning Officer to issue or
refuse a zoning permit accordingly. [Amended 12-12-1994 by
Ord. No. 527]
(5) Permit after request for reclassification or amendment. Where the
applicant feels that this chapter is in need of change in any part,
the applicant may petition for the City Council to consider an
amendment to this chapter. Such a petition shall be referred to the
Planning Commission for their recommendation. The City Council
may then, after proper notice, hold a public hearing on the
proposed amendment. After the hearing, the City Council shall
make their decision on the proposed amendment. If the amendment
is adopted, the applicant can then proceed to apply for a zoning
permit in the manner applicable to the type of use that he wishes to
propose.

permitted in the zone district vary the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter, provided that said variance shall be in the

result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that would deprive
the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building involved, but in
no other case.
B. Purpose of variance. The sole purpose of any variance shall be to
prevent discrimination, and no variance shall be granted which would

any provision of this chapter shall be granted by the Board unless it
finds the following:
(1) That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described
in the findings, applying to the land or buildings that do not apply
generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood.
(2) That said circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.
(3) That for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the
variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building
and that the variance, as granted by the Board, is the minimum

Chapter A226
CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
GENERAL REFERENCES
Electrical standards  See Ch. 112. Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 194.
§ A226-1. Purpose.
A. The City of Pottsville finds that the development of cable television and
communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and
impact upon the people of Pottsville. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the City
further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare
can best be served by establishing regulatory power which should be
vested in the City or such persons as the City shall designate pursuant
to a new ordinance replacing Ordinance No. 215-76 which presently
regulates cable television in the City of Pottsville.182 It is the intent of
this ordinance to provide for and specify the means to attain the best
possible public interest and public purpose in these matters, and any
franchise issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be deemed to include
this finding as an integral part thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide
not only entertainment and information services to the City's residents,
but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications
services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve
City agencies and other public institutions by providing governmental,
educational or health care communications.
C. It is further recognized that cable systems and services are rapidly
changing and will continue to change in the future.
D. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
(1) Communications services should be provided to the maximum
number of City residents.
(2) The cable system should be capable of accommodating both the
present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of
the City.
182. Editor's Note: Prior to enactment of this Ord. No. 721, Ord. No. 677, adopted 9-9-2002,

Communications Regulatory Ordinance," and it shall become a part of

codes and ordinances of the City regarding taxes, permits, fees to

additional franchises for a cable system or any component thereof,
to any other person including itself, as it deems appropriate,
subject to this ordinance and applicable state and federal law.
(2) The material terms and conditions of any cable franchises granted
or renewed after the effective date of this ordinance shall be, when
taken as a whole, no less burdensome or more beneficial than any
other cable franchises granted or renewed subject to this
ordinance, including but not limited to franchise fees, insurance,
§ A226-4 POTTSVILLE CODE § A226-4
210:540
system build-out requirements, performance bonds or similar
instruments, public, education and government access channels
and support, customer service standards, required reports and
related record keeping, and notice and opportunity to cure.
I. Selection of initial franchisee.
(1) In selecting a franchisee pursuant to this ordinance, the City will
prepare a request for proposals to seek bids for a cable system to
be established under a franchise by the City. This request for
proposals will contain information and instructions relating to the
preparation and filing of proposals; conditions regarding the
installation, operation, and maintenance of a cable system; and the
criteria to be used in evaluating applicant proposals. Any person
desiring an initial franchise for a cable system shall file an
application with the City. A nonrefundable application fee as may
hereinafter be established by the City shall accompany the
application, which shall not be considered or credited against the
collection of applicable franchise fee. The provisions of this section
will not be applicable to the renewal of any franchise.
(2) Applicants may be evaluated according to the following criteria:
(a) Installation plan. Consideration may be given to an installation
plan that would provide the flexibility needed to adjust to new
developments, maintenance practices, and services that would
be available to the subscriber and the community immediately
and in the future.
(b) Rate schedule. Consideration may be given to applicants with
the most reasonable installation and subscriber rate schedule.
(c) Financial soundness and capability. The evidence of financial
ability required in the applicant's proposal will be such as to
assure the ability to complete the entire system within a
maximum of three years from the date the franchise is granted.
The City will also consider the applicant's ability to operate the
cable system and provide the necessary services.
(d) Demonstrated experience in operating a cable system.
Consideration may be given to evidence of the applicant's
experience in operating a cable system, where such evidence
would show or tend to show or confirm the ability of the
applicant to furnish sufficient and dependable service to the
potential public and private users.
(e) Technical capability. The City may consider the quality of
service offered, including signal quality, response to customer
complaints, and billing practices.
(f) Future needs. Consideration may be given to the franchisee's
ability to meet the future cable-related community needs and
§ A226-4 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § A226-4
210:541
interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs
and interests.
(g) Additional considerations. The City may consider any
additional information that it deems applicable.
J. Time is of the essence to this agreement. Whenever the franchise
agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on
behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence, and
any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted after due
notice and a reasonable time to cure may be sufficient ground for the
City to invoke the penalties and remedies set forth in this ordinance.
K. Law governs. In any controversy or dispute under this ordinance, the
law of the state or federal law and/or regulations shall apply; where
there is a choice of law, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
shall be applied.
L. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this ordinance is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any
federal, state or local statute or regulation, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
M. Transfer of ownership or control.
(1) Transfer of franchise. For purposes of this Subsection M, the term
"transfer" or "transferred" shall mean: the disposal by the grantee,
directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger,
consolidation or otherwise, of 51% or more at one time or
cumulatively over the term of the franchise of the ownership or
controlling interest in the cable system to a corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, trust or association or person or
group of persons acting in concert which is not under the same
ultimate control as the grantee; provided, however, that any
pledge, assignment or hypothecation of the cable system to a
financial institution as security for debt shall not be considered a
"transfer."
(2) Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any event be
transferred without the prior consent of the City, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be
required, however, for (a) a transfer in trust, by mortgage,
hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or interest of
the grantee in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness; or
(b) a transfer to an entity owned and/or controlled by a parent
corporation of grantee.
(3) The grantee shall promptly notify the City of any actual or proposed
transfer and comply with applicable provisions of the Cable Act and
rules of the FCC. This section shall not apply to a transfer to,
§ A226-4 POTTSVILLE CODE § A226-4
210:542
acquisition by or merger into a wholly owned subsidiary or an
affiliated entity wholly owned by the grantee and/or under the same
ultimate control as the grantee.
(4) In accordance with applicable provisions of the Cable Act, for the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such transfer,
the City may inquire into the legal, financial, character and
technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry.
(5) Assumption of control. Upon default by the franchisee, a financial
institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
cable system shall notify the City of its intent to have it or its
designees take control of and operate the cable system. Said
financial institution shall submit a plan for the operation of the
cable system that will ensure continued service and compliance
with all franchise obligations during the term that the financial
institution exercises control over the cable system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the cable system for a
period exceeding one year without the approval of the City, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and during said
period of time the financial institution shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee as though it
were the original grantee. If the City finds that such transfer, after
considering the legal, financial, character, and technical and other
public interest qualifications of the applicant is satisfactory, the
City shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such
franchisee as in the public interest. The consent of the City to such
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) The City may require the grantee to furnish information to assist in
the review of the proposed transfer of the franchise and will,
consistent with the Cable Act and FCC rules, either approve or
deny the transfer within 120 days after the date it receives notice of
the transfer in writing from a grantee.
(7) The consent or approval of the City to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.
(8) Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership or control shall be
contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement, as provided in § A226-4G
herein.
N. Franchise renewal.
(1) Renewal. Upon completion of the term of any franchise or
extension granted under this ordinance, the City, subject to the
§ A226-4 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § A226-4
210:543
Cable Act, FCC rules and other applicable law, may grant or deny
renewal of the franchise of the grantee.
(2) Renewal procedures. The grantee's franchise shall be subject to
renewal according to the terms, procedures and provisions set
forth in the Cable Act, FCC rules and other applicable law.
O. Police powers.
(1) In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of
the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws
and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such power.
(2) Any conflict between the provisions of this ordinance or the
franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the
City's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except
that any such exercise that is not of general application in the
jurisdiction or applies exclusively to the grantee or cable systems
which contains provisions inconsistent with this ordinance or the
franchise agreement shall prevail only if upon such exercise the
City finds that an emergency exists constituting a danger to health,
safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated
by law.
P. Franchise fees.
(1) Because the City finds that the streets of the county, state and City
to be used by the grantee in the operation of its cable system within
the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the City at expense to its taxpayers;
and the grant to the grantee of the use of said streets is a valuable
right without which the grantee would be required to invest
substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and the
administration of any franchise issued pursuant to this ordinance
imposes upon the City additional regulator responsibility and
expense, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the City
an annual fee of 5% of the gross annual revenues; or the maximum
amount permitted under applicable federal law if such maximum is
greater than 5%; which gross annual revenues, for the purpose of
calculating the franchise fee, shall include the amount of the
franchise fee. This annual franchise payment shall be in addition to
any other fee which is not defined as a franchise fee by the Cable
Act and shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise.
The City shall be furnished a statement certified by a financial
representative of the grantee with each quarterly payment to the
City. The statement shall include a line item for every source of
revenue received and the amount of revenue received from each
source for the period covered by the payment.
§ A226-4 POTTSVILLE CODE § A226-4
210:544
(2) In the event that it is determined by the federal or state
government or any agency thereof or by any court of competent
jurisdiction upon final adjudication that the City lacks the authority
to impose the maximum franchise fee permitted by federal law or
that the federal, state or local government or any agency thereof
lacks jurisdiction to impose franchise fees, then the parties shall
follow that determination or adjudication.
(3) Subject to the cable act, the franchise fee payment shall be in
addition to any lawful tax or payment owed to the City by the
grantee.
(4) Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable
as a franchise fee by a grantee under this ordinance or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
(5) Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation
an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual
rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate in effect upon the
due date.
(6) Quarterly payment. The franchise fee shall be paid quarterly to the
City Clerk of the City of Pottsville, payable to the City of Pottsville.
The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of
all Gross Annual Revenue within the City during the period for
which said quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be
made to the City not later than 45 days after the expiration of each
calendar quarter. Quarters end on the last day in the months of
March, June, September and December.
(7) Inspection. The City, upon reasonable notice, shall have the right to
inspect the grantee's revenue records and the right to audit,
limited to the previous three full calendar years and to recompute
any amounts determined to be payable under this ordinance. The
auditor shall be selected by the City, and the audit shall be
conducted in conformance with generally accepted auditing
procedures and generally accepted accounting principles. Up to
$4,000 of the cost of an audit shall be at the expense of the grantee
if it is found an amount greater than 105% of the original amount
paid (i.e., a franchise fee payment of 5% or more) is due the City,
but only to the extent of the amount due. In the event that grantee
and the City do not agree that the amount represents an
underpayment, upon the completion of any such audit by the City,
the City shall provide to the franchisee a final report, which sets
forth the City's findings in detail, including any and all
substantiating documentation. The franchisee shall have 30 days
from the receipt of the report to provide the City with a written
§ A226-4 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § A226-4
210:545
response including any substantiating documentation. Any finally
settled amount(s) due to the City as a result of such inspection shall
be paid to the City by the franchisee within 30 days from receipt
of written notice of the acceptance of such finally settled amount(s)
from the City. For purposes of this § A226-4P(7), the term "finally
settled amount(s)" shall mean the agreed upon underpayment, if
any, to the franchising authority by the grantee as a result of any
such audit. Provided, however, that any such audit shall take place
within three years from the date the City receives such payment,
after which period any such payment shall be considered final.
Q. Forfeiture or revocation.
(1) Grounds for revocation. The City reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and to rescind all rights and
privileges associated with the franchise after providing notice and
a period for cure as provided for in § A226-4Q. Each of the
following circumstances shall represent a default and breach under
the ordinance and the franchise grant and shall be grounds for
revocation of the franchise:
(a) If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this ordinance or the franchise
agreement entered into by and between the City and the
grantee.
(b) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the
performance bond as required herein.
(c) If the grantee shall knowingly violate any orders or rulings of
any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee
relative to the material provisions of this ordinance for the
franchise, unless such rulings are subject to appeal, but only
during such period of appeal, if and only if a supersede order is
in effect.
(d) If the grantee evades any of the material provisions of this
ordinance or the franchise agreement or practices any fraud
upon the City or cable subscribers.
(e) If applicable, the grantee's construction schedule is delayed
later than the schedule contained in the franchise agreement
or beyond any extended date set by the City.
(f) If the grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its
debts or is adjudicated bankrupt.
(g) Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service throughout the entire service area, except
when approval of such interruption is obtained from the City or
§ A226-4 POTTSVILLE CODE § A226-4
210:546
such failure is the result of a force majeure and/or beyond the
control of the grantee.
(h) Material misrepresentation of fact, as adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the application for or negotiation of
the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
(i) Consistent with applicable law, if the grantee ceases to provide
services for a period of 30 days as set forth in the agreement
for any reason within the control of the grantee over the cable
system.
(j) If the grantee shall fail to pay any taxes or assessments levied
by the City of Pottsville within 60 days after the same are due
and after the entry of a final, unappealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction upholding the validity of such taxes or
assessments and their enforceability against the grantee.
(2) Effect of circumstances beyond control of the grantee. The grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under
any provision of this ordinance in any case in which performance of
any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's
control.
(3) Pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any
regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall
not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations
under this ordinance or the franchise agreement unless injunctive
relief is obtained.
(4) Procedure prior to revocation.
(a) Prior to any revocation of a franchise, the City shall make
written demand that the grantee comply with a specified
requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or
correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure,
refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 60
days following the receipt of such written demand, and the
grantee has failed to provide a written explanation or to
request additional time to cure any alleged default, the City
shall place its request for termination of the franchise upon a
regular Council meeting agenda. The City shall cause to be
served upon the grantee at least seven days prior to the date of
such Council meeting a written notice of this intent to request
such termination and the time and place of the meeting, notice
of which shall be published by the City Clerk at least once,
seven days before such meeting, in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City.
(b) The Council shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine in its discretion whether or not any failure, refusal
or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
§ A226-4 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § A226-4
210:547
(c) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as reasonably determined by the City, then the City shall
prepare a written finding in support of its determination and
the Council shall direct the grantee to comply within a
specified time and manner and upon such terms and conditions
as are reasonable.
(d) if the Council shall determine that the grounds for revocation
as set forth in Subsection Q(1) exist and were without just
cause, then the Council shall, by resolution, declare that the
franchise of the grantee shall be terminated unless there is
compliance by the grantee within 90 days.
(5) Disposition of facilities. In the event that a franchise is not renewed
or is revoked or otherwise terminated, the City may, in accordance
with this ordinance and applicable law, order the removal of the
cable system facilities required by public necessity from the City
within a reasonable period of time as determined by the City.
(6) Restoration of property. In the event it is required to remove its
plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own
expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all
public ways and places in as good a condition as that prevailing
prior to the grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances
without affecting the condition of the public ways and public places
and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. Upon
request, the grantee shall remove cable from City-owned conduit.
The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as
provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the
period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee with the
terms and conditions of this section, this ordinance and the
franchise agreement.
(7) Restoration by City; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by Subsection
Q(6) above, or any other work required by City law or ordinance
within such reasonable time as may be established and to a
condition similar to that existing prior to the grantee's work, the
City, following notice and an opportunity to cure, may cause such
work to be done, and the grantee shall reimburse the City the cost
thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs
or the City may recover such costs through the security fund
provided by the grantee. The City shall be permitted to seek legal
and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
R. Receivership and foreclosure; termination by insolvency. Subject to
applicable law, the failure of grantee to file a petition to discharge a
bankruptcy petition within a period of 120 days shall constitute a
material breach of the franchise and shall subject grantee to
termination or lawful revocation of the franchise in accordance with the
§ A226-4 POTTSVILLE CODE § A226-4
210:548
§ A226-5. Regulation of franchise.
notice and opportunity to cure and other applicable sections of this
ordinance.
S. Equal opportunity policy. Equal opportunity employment shall be
afforded by all operators of cable television systems to all qualified and
qualifiable persons, and no person shall be discriminated against in
employment because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, sex or
physical handicap. The grantee shall comply with all equal opportunity
provisions lawfully enacted by federal, state and local authorities, as
well as all such provisions contained in this ordinance and the franchise
agreement.
T. Notices. All notices from the grantee to the City pursuant to this
ordinance and the franchise agreement shall be to the City
Administrator or his/her designee.
U. Failure of City to enforce this franchise is not a waiver of the terms
thereof. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of
the terms and conditions of this ordinance or the franchise by any
failure of the City upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to
seek compliance with any such terms or conditions.
V. Rights reserved to the grantor.
(1) Right of inspection of records. The City shall have the right to
inspect on a confidential basis those books, records, reports, maps,
plans, financial statements and other like materials of the grantee
as they relate to the cable system which are reasonably necessary
in order to verify compliance with this ordinance and the franchise

available such information as may be reasonably requested by the
City.

notice the City shall have the right to inspect all construction or
