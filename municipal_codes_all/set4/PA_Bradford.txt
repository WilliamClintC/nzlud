§ 114-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 114-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 114-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
§ 114-2 FIRE PREVENTION § 114-6
111:125
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Bradford
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 114-17. Identification.
§ 114-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of City of Bradford, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
December 22, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by City of Bradford and declared
to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
§ 114-17 FIRE PREVENTION § 114-18
111:135
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted in an
AE Zone without floodway, unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed development, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, would not result in an increase in
flood levels of more than one foot within the entire community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality. In the absence of any of the above data or
documentation, the community may require elevation of the lowest
floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one foot and three feet. In Zones AO and
AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around
and away from structures on slopes.
§ 114-18 BRADFORD CODE § 114-19
111:136
§ 114-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 114-22B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 114-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the City of Bradford and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Council. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 114-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When City of Bradford proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges); the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachment to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, an applicant
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other applicable

§ 125-4. Intent and purpose.
Pursuant to Article I, Section 27, of the Pennsylvania Constitution which
states that:
People have the right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of
the natural environment. Pennsylvania's public natural resources are the
common property to all people, including generations yet to come. As
trustees of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and
maintain them for the benefit of all the people.
the City Council of the City of Bradford hereby declares as a matter of
public policy that the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of
landmarks in the Historic District are necessary to promote the economic,
cultural, educational and general welfare of the public. Inasmuch as the
City of Bradford has many significant historic, landscape, architectural
and cultural resources which constitute its heritage, this is intended to
protect and enhance the landmarks and the historic districts which
represent distinctive elements of the City's historic, architectural and
cultural heritage; as well as fostering civic pride in the accomplishments
of the past; to protect and enhance the City's attractiveness to visitors and
thereby providing support and stimulus to the economy; and to ensure the
harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and development of the City. The
City of Bradford hereby establishes a procedure for maintaining
architectural standards in the construction of new buildings and in the
modification or removal of existing buildings and providing and
implementing a coordinated and comprehensive plan for the preservation
of the Historic District.

investment in the property for rehabilitation purposes.
(2) The property cannot be adapted for any other use permitted by the

proponents and opponents of the application to present their views.
Such a hearing will be within 90 days of filing of the hardship

§ 125-13 GAS AND OIL WELLS § 125-15
118:185
§ 125-15. Standards to guide Commission.
The Commission shall be guided by the following standards in approving or
disapproving applications:
A. General principles.
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environments, or to use a property for its
original intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environments shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural feature should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that are incompatible shall be
discouraged.
(4) Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials or historic
landscape features shall not be undertaken.
(8) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
§ 125-15 BRADFORD CODE § 125-15
118:186
B. Design guidelines. In applying the principals for review, the HARB shall
consider whether the proposed alteration or construction is compatible
with the landmark, historic property and/or surrounding properties in
the historic district with regard to:
(1) Height. The height of a building shall be compatible with the
surrounding buildings.
(a) Generally, maximum building height shall not be greater than
the taller of the next two abutting structures on each side of
the building site, provided that such structures are in
conformance with bulk regulations of the zoning district.
(b) Generally, minimum building height of a street facade shall not
be less than the lower of the next two abutting structures on
each side of the building site, provided that such structures are
in conformance with bulk regulations of the zoning district.
(2) Scale. The relationship of a building and its elements to human
size, form and perception. The scale of a building shall be
compatible with the surrounding buildings.
(3) Proportion. The relationship among the dimensions of various
elements.
(a) Front facade. The relationship of the width of a building to the
height of the front elevation shall be compatible with the
surrounding buildings.
(b) Openings. The relationship of the width of windows and doors
to their height shall be compatible with the surrounding
buildings.
(4) Rhythm. The pattern resulting from repeated elements such as
window and door openings, columns, arches and other facade
elements. The rhythmic relationship between a building's facade
elements shall be compatible with the surrounding buildings. In
cases where new construction occupies more than one house lot,
the rhythm of the separate building units existing on the street
shall be carried across the facade. Some of the ways this may be
achieved include the grouping of openings in clusters, the
employment of reveals in wall plans or the use of structural bays.
(5) Directional expression. The directional expression of a building
shall be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of the surrounding buildings.
(6) Massing and open space. The relationship of a building to open
space between it and the adjoining buildings shall be compatible
with the character of the surrounding area.
(7) Setback. The front yard setback for the building line of all new
construction shall be no closer to the street than the closest or no
§ 125-15 GAS AND OIL WELLS § 125-15
118:187
further from the street than the next two abutting structures on
each side of the building site, provided that such structures are in
conformance with area regulations of the zoning district.
C. Major building elements.
(1) Storefronts. Existing historic storefronts shall be retained and
rehabilitated whenever possible. Storefronts which have been
altered or removed shall be restored or compatibly redesigned.
(2) Doors. Existing historic doors and openings shall be retained and

Loitering and Prowling
[Adopted 8-25-1970 by Ord. No. 2853]
§ 154-4. Prohibited acts; duty of peace officer.
It is unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in
a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that
warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among
the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such
alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance
of a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to
conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other
circumstances makes it impracticable, a peace officer shall, prior to any
arrest for violation of this article, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel
any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him to
identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be
convicted of an offense under this article if the peace officer did not comply
with the preceding sentence or if it appears at hearing that the explanation
given by the actor was true and, if believed by the peace officer at the time,
would have dispelled the alarm.
§ 154-5. Violations and penalties.
Any person violating the provisions of this article, upon conviction thereof
before a District Magistrate, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $300

ARTICLE VIII
Graffiti
[Adopted 10-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3224]
§ 154-30. Findings.
Graffiti is a symbol of blight that reduces property values and inhibits
economic growth. Graffiti encourages further acts of vandalism and crime.
The use of aerosol paint containers to write or place graffiti on the walls
or other available spaces on public or private buildings, vehicles, areas or
facilities causes serious defacement of such buildings, vehicles and areas,
public and private, and contributes to the deterioration of property values,
as well as offending the public's right, public and private, to not have
unsightly and unlawful graffiti on, with defacement of, public and private
property, and it constitutes a deleterious practice contrary to the public
health and welfare. In addition, such contempt for the property rights of
private citizens, as well as public facilities, contributes to the erosion of law
and order and contributes to the deterioration in the quality of life of the
community and must be opposed and punished.
§ 154-31. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:
AEROSOL PAINT CONTAINER  Any canister, can, bottle, container or
other receptacle which contains any substance commonly known as "paint,"
"stain," "dye" or other pigmented substance which is or can be modified to
contain pressure, or be pressurizing, in order to impel or propel any such
substance.
GRAFFITI  Includes any and all unsightly, offensive or defacing writings,
drawings, markings or other written or pictorial matter by any method
or device and of any content which contributes to the defacement of the
real or personal property involved and which contributes to the ugliness
and unsightliness of the object, space, area or community and which is
detrimental to the beauty, neatness and good order of the area and
community. This article shall not be construed to prohibit easily removable
chalk markings on the public sidewalks and streets used in connection with
traditional children's games.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 years.
PERSON  Includes associations, businesses, clubs, corporations, firms,
partnerships and bodies politic, as well as all individuals.
PROPERTY  Any public or private property in the City of Bradford.
§ 154-32. Defacement of property prohibited.
No person shall write, print or place with ink, paint, chalk or other
substances graffiti on the real or personal property of another, whether said
personal or real property is publicly or privately owned.
§ 154-30 MOBILE HOMES AND MOVABLE TRAILERS § 154-33
143:251
§ 154-33. Possession of graffiti instruments by minors restricted.
No minor shall have in his or her possession any aerosol paint container
while on any public property, highway, street, alley, sidewalk or park, or
while on any private property without the consent of the respective owner
of such property, in a manner that warrants a justifiable and reasonable
alarm or immediate concern for the safety of property in the vicinity. Among
the circumstances which may be considered by the enforcement officer in
determining whether such alarm or immediate concern is warranted is the
fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of an enforcement officer,
refuses to identify himself or herself or manifestly endeavors to conceal
himself or herself or the graffiti tool. Prior to any citation being issued
to a person for violation of this article, such person shall be afforded an
opportunity by the enforcement officer to dispel any alarm or immediate
concern which could otherwise be warranted by requesting him or her to
identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct.
§ 154-34. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for any parent, legal guardian or other person having
custody and care of any minor child under the age of 18 years to knowingly
assist, aid, abet, allow, permit or encourage said minor to violate the
provisions of this article, as herein defined, either by words, overt act or by
failing to act.
§ 154-35. Accessories to prohibited acts.
All persons directly or indirectly involved shall be equally responsible and
guilty, not alone the individual who may personally deface the object or
area, but others in a group who knowingly make available the tools, writing
material, ladders, lookout, materials or assistance or who knowingly supply
funds to acquire such materials for such purposes shall be equally guilty
and liable to punishment under this article.
§ 154-36. Violations and penalties.
A. Any person who or which will violate any provision of this article shall,
upon his or her first conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not
less than $25 nor more than $300 and/or to imprisonment for a term not
to exceed 90 days.
B. Upon a conviction for the second time, the person shall be sentenced to
pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $300 and/or to
imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days.
C. Upon a conviction for the third or greater time, the person shall be
sentenced to pay a fine of $300 and/or to imprisonment for a term not to
exceed 90 days.
D. Any person who violates this article shall also be required, either
severally or jointly with others, to pay restitution to the victim(s).

143:252
§ 154-37. Liability of property owners for removal; fine; recovery of
costs.
Property owners shall be liable for removal of graffiti in the event that the
person responsible for defacing the property cannot be determined. Upon
proper notice by the duly authorized City official, the property owner shall
remove or cause to be removed any and all such graffiti within the period
hereinafter provided.1 Failure to comply with this section shall result in the
imposition of a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $300. In the event
that the City shall cause to have the graffiti removed because the owner has
not complied with an order to do so, the City may recover the costs of the
same from the property owner.
NOTES:
1Between November 1 and April 30, the removal period is 45 days. During
all other periods, the removal period is 20 days.
§ 154-38. Notice to remove.
Upon discovery of graffiti, any authorized person shall issue written notice
to the owner, occupant or other responsible agent of any premises whereon
graffiti is present in violation of the provisions of this article, directing and
requiring such person to remove such graffiti. In the event that graffiti is
not removed within the applicable removal period from the date of mailing
of this first notice, a second notice to remove and request for consent to
allow the City to enter upon the property for the purpose of graffiti removal
at the owner's expense shall be issued.
§ 154-39. Sale of graffiti implements to minors; letter of
permission.
Sale and display of graffiti implements; violations. No person shall sell, offer
to sell or give aerosol spray paint to any person under the age of 18 years
of age unless accompanied by an adult, parent or guardian or unless that
person is in possession of a letter of permission from a sponsoring agency,
employer or school. This letter must be on the sponsor's letterhead and
signed by an adult with supervisory authority over 18 years of age.
§ 154-40. Antigraffiti donation account.
There is hereby created the municipal antigraffiti donation account within
the Capital Reserve Fund. The account may receive monetary donations
from citizens, businesses and other organizations. City Council shall direct
the expenditure of monies in the graffiti donation account for the purpose
of eliminating graffiti in the City of Bradford.
§ 154-41. Neighboring municipalities to adopt similar legislation.

endeavor to have the municipalities in close territorial proximity to the City

of Bradford adopt legislation prohibiting the conduct as set forth by this

from offering such properties for sale without revealing such illegal use
or the existence of housing, building, safety, plumbing, electrical, fire

regard or concerning the charges due against said property or the
seller by the City, the City Council finds that it is in the best interest of
the City of Bradford to declare that all sellers of property, as defined

purchase property at sale for delinquent taxes or at any judicial
sale, and thereafter sell the property without the property being

Enforcement Officer. In this event, any attempted sale by a
purchaser at a sale for delinquent taxes or judicial sale, shall be
regarded as a "second sale" within the terms of this article.

any liability not otherwise imposed by law.

temporary certificate of compliance is issued following an
inspection, the date of that inspection, rather than the date of any
reinspection, shall begin the two-year period.
§ 169-4 POLES AND WIRES § 169-5
160:293
(2) If the inspection discloses violations, the Property Maintenance
Officer shall issue a letter to the owner or owner's agent with seven
days of said inspection. The letter shall set forth the following:
(a) Street address or appropriate description of the property.
(b) Date of inspection.
(c) Statement of code violations.

and which the temporary certificate of compliance will be in
effect.

compliance.
(f) Statement of delinquent taxes and/or utilities. [Added

(3) When the Property Maintenance Officer has determined that a
rental unit is in compliance with all applicable City ordinances,
codes and regulations, with all applicable county ordinances, codes
and regulations and with all applicable state laws and regulations,
he shall issue a certificate of compliance for the inspected rental
unit.
(4) If, upon completion of an inspection, a rental unit is found to be in
violation of one or more provisions of applicable City, county or
state codes and ordinances, the Property Maintenance Officer shall
take one of the following actions:
(a) Provide the owner(s) and/or responsible local agent with
written notice of such violation(s) and require that they be
corrected within a time frame stipulated by the Property
Maintenance Officer. The time period for correcting most
violations shall be 30 days or less; however, if a violation
cannot reasonably be expected to be corrected within that time
period, an extended period shall be permitted at the discretion
of the Property Maintenance Officer. For serious violations that
pose a serious risk to the health and safety of the tenants but
do not require the property be immediately vacated under
Subsection B(4)(b) below, the Property Maintenance Officer
may require that the violations be corrected within a period as
short as 24 hours. By mutual agreement with the owner or
responsible local agent, the Property Maintenance Officer shall
set a reinspection date before which such violation(s) shall be
corrected. If such violation(s) have not been corrected within
the stipulated period of time, the Property Maintenance Officer
shall not issue the certificate of compliance and may take any

in which case it shall be vacated.

City, the owner(s) and/or responsible local agent shall be notified in
writing. In the event that the complaint is of an emergency nature,
as determined by the City, it will require immediate compliance and
remediation by the owner and/or the responsible local agent. In the
absence of adequate compliance and remediation, any code
violation(s) may be abated by the City and charged to the owner(s)
and/or the responsible local agent. If the complaint is not of an
emergency nature, the owner and/or responsible local agent shall
be afforded a reasonable period of time to correct such violation(s).
The time period for correcting most violations shall be 30 days or
less; however, if a violation cannot reasonably be corrected within a
thirty-day period, an extended period may be granted by the
Property Maintenance Officer. In the absence of adequate
compliance and remediation, any code violation(s) may be abated
by the City and charged to the owner(s) and/or the responsible
local agent.
(6) No inspection shall be complete until, inter alia, all inspection fees
are paid in full. If the inspection is rescheduled and the owner or
responsible local agent fails to appear a second time, failure to
appear shall constitute a violation of this article. Failure to secure
the required inspection within 30 days of the first scheduled
inspection shall result in revocation of any existing certificate of
compliance for the rental unit.
(7) All owners and responsible local agents shall allow any and all
agents, employees and contractors of the City access to the
premises, and to any owner-occupied rental unit and/or rental unit
situate thereon, to enable the City to make any examinations and
investigations that it deems necessary and proper and shall further
all the City and all of its agents, employees, representatives and
contractors to take any compliance action authorized by this article
or by an order of the Board of Health. No owners and/or
responsible local agents shall obstruct, impede or otherwise
interfere with the entry and actions of the City or of its agents,
employees, representatives or contractors. If entry is refused or not
obtained, the City and its agents are authorized to pursue recourse
as provided by law, including, but not limited to, seeking the
issuance of a search warrant.
(8) In extreme circumstances when health and safety of the public is
compromised, the City reserves the right to make repairs to correct
the violation when the owner shall neglect, fail, or refuse to comply

conspicuous place in each rental unit along with the name, address and

compliance, the owner or responsible local agent may give the tenant a
copy of the certificate of compliance. The owner or responsible local
agent shall prepare and have the tenant sign a writing which
acknowledges every tenant's receipt of the copy of the certificate of
compliance. The signed writing shall be filed with the City within five
days of the tenant(s) taking occupancy of the rental unit.

Chapter 172
SECONDHAND DEALERS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Peddlers and transient retail
merchants  See Ch. 156.
§ 172-1. Findings and purpose.
A. Findings. The City of Bradford Council makes the following findings
regarding the need to regulate pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers, junk
dealers, auto salvage dealers and scrap iron and metal processors
operating within the City:
(1) Pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, auto salvage
dealers and scrap iron and metal processors and businesses
associated with those occupations provide an opportunity for
persons committing a crime to conceal that crime and profit from
that crime by using those establishments to receive and transfer
stolen property easily and quickly.
(2) Because of the propensity of pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers,
junk dealers, auto salvage dealers and scrap iron and metal
processors to attract criminals attempting to conduct transactions
involving stolen goods, those establishments have the potential to
be generally injurious to the maintenance and development of
healthy adjacent commercial, recreational and residential areas.
(3) Consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions
involving pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, auto
salvage dealers and scrap iron and metal processors in light of the
potential for abuse.
(4) To safeguard the public health, safety and welfare and to help
stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the establishments
identified in this chapter, it is necessary to require licensing and
regulation of those establishments.
B. Purpose. The City Council enacts this chapter in order to further the
following objectives:
(1) The prevention of pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers, junk dealers,
auto salvage dealers and scrap iron and metal processors and
associated businesses from being used as facilities for the
commission or furtherance of crimes.
(2) The identification of criminal activities through timely collection
and sharing of transaction information.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 187-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Bradford
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 187-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the City of Bradford finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare
and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 187-1 SEWERS § 187-2
175:355
§ 187-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the City of Bradford, McKean County, by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 187-2 of this chapter through
provisions intended to:
§ 187-4. Statutory authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management
practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.

Notwithstanding any provision(s) of this chapter, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety
or other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required
to manage the rate, volume, direction and quality of resulting stormwater
A. In the City of Bradford, all regulated activities and all activities that
may affect stormwater runoff, including land development and earth

imposed by a municipal official hereunder, shall relieve any person from
any responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting
therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon
the municipality for damages to persons or property.
B. The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of
any kind by the municipality, or by an official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and
shall create no liability upon or cause of action against such public
body, official or employee for any damage that may result pursuant

§ 187-12 SEWERS § 187-12
175:373
F. The municipality can require more information or require mitigation of
certain impacts through installation of stormwater management BMPs
if there is a threat to property, health or safety.
G. An applicant proposing regulated activities, after demonstrating
compliance with Subsections A, B and C, may be exempted from various
requirements of this chapter if documentation can be provided that a
downstream man-made water body (i.e., reservoir, lake or man-made
wetlands) has been designed or modified to address the potential
stormwater flooding impacts of the proposed development.
H. The purpose this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. The municipality may accept alternative stormwater
management controls under this section, provided that:
(1) The municipality, in consultation with the PADEP, determines that
meeting the volume control requirements (see § 187-14) is not
possible or places an undue hardship on the applicant.
(2) The alternative controls are documented to be acceptable to
PADEP, for NPDES requirements pertaining to postconstruction
stormwater management requirements.

and volume control requirement and SWM site plan preparation
requirement of this chapter, provided that the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102. It should be
noted that temporary roadways are not exempt.
K. Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional
impervious area are not exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
However, innovative and alternative stormwater management
strategies may be applied at the joint approval of the municipality and
the McKean County Conservation District (if an NPDES permit is
required) when site limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and
constraints (as shown and provided by the applicant), preclude the
ability of the applicant to meet the enforcement of the stormwater
management standards in this chapter. All strategies must be
consistent with PADEP's regulations, including NPDES requirements.

the municipality that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or hardship
as it applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate design may
result in a superior result within the context of §§ 187-2 and 187-3 of
this chapter, the governing body of the municipality upon obtaining the
comments and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer and
Conservation District may grant a waiver or relief so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest is secured, provided that
such waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of this chapter.
D. The applicant shall submit all requests for waivers in writing and shall
include such requests as a part of the plan review and approval process.
The applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of
the chapter that are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief that is
necessary. The applicant shall state how the requested waiver and how
the applicant's proposal shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent or purpose and general principles of this
chapter.
E. The municipality shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests.
F. The municipality may charge a fee for each waiver request, which shall
be used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing the waiver
§ 187-12 SEWERS § 187-13
175:375
request. The applicant shall also agree to reimburse the municipality
for reasonable and necessary fees that may be incurred by the
Municipal Engineer in any review of a waiver request.
G. In granting waivers, the municipality may impose reasonable conditions
that will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements that are to be modified.
H. The municipality may grant applications for waivers when the following
findings are made, as relevant:
(1) That the waiver shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent of this chapter.
(2) That the waiver is the minimum necessary to provide relief.
(3) That the applicant is not requesting a waiver based on cost
considerations.
(4) That existing down-gradient stormwater problems will not be
exacerbated.
(5) That runoff is not being diverted to a different drainage area.
(6) That increased flooding or ponding on off-site properties or
roadways will not occur.
(7) That potential icing conditions will not occur.
(8) That increase of peak flow or volume from the site will not occur.
(9) That erosive conditions due to increased peak flows or volume will
not occur.
(10) That adverse impact to water quality will not result.
(11) That increased one-hundred-year floodplain levels will not result.
(12) That increased or unusual municipal maintenance expenses will
not result from the waiver.
(13) That the amount of stormwater generated has been minimized to
the greatest extent allowed.

175:376
§ 187-14. Volume controls.
(17) That the receiving streams and/or water bodies will not be
adversely impacted in flood-carrying capacity, aquatic habitat,
channel stability and erosion and sedimentation.
A. The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual and
in Appendix B129 of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume when
compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for the
two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
129. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Low Impact Development Practices, is included at the end of
this chapter.

commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test
shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the municipality shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within McKean County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) Postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year storms.
B. Lands contained within McKean County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) The postdevelopment peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the individual watershed.
(a) Tunungwant Creek Watershed: 70% and 100% release rate
districts have been established; refer to Appendix F.130
(b) Allegheny River Watershed: 100% release rate districts have
been established; refer to Appendix F.

timber harvesting, etc.) shall comply with all applicable standards for
erosion and sedimentation control and stream crossing regulations
under 25 Pa. Code Chapters 102 and 105. The erosion and
sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the McKean County
Conservation District for approval and shall address the following, as
applicable:
(1) Design of the roadway system, including haul roads, skid roads,
landing areas, trails, and storage and staging areas.
(2) Runoff control structures (e.g., diversions, culverts, detention
ponds, etc.).

175:379
E. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, as to
maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall be protected from receiving sediment-laden
runoff.
(3) The source of protection for infiltration BMPs shall be identified
(i.e., orange construction fence surrounding the perimeter of the
BMP).

ARTICLE VIII
Design Criteria
§ 187-27. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding,
diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration
systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and grading patterns).
They shall be located, designed and constructed in accordance with
the latest technical guidance published by PADEP, provided that
they are accompanied by detailed engineering plans and
performance capabilities and supporting site specific soils, geology,
runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify
proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources may be
accepted at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer (a
preapplication meeting is suggested).
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
municipality shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
§ 187-27 SEWERS § 187-27
175:395
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the municipality, and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway.
(2) The top, or toe, of any slope shall be located a minimum of 10 feet
from any property line.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any structure and any
stormwater facility shall be 25 feet. The lowest floor elevation of
any structure constructed immediately adjacent to a detention
basin or other stormwater facility shall be a minimum of two feet
above the one-hundred-year water surface elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is defined,
bottom elevations must be greater than existing ground elevations
50 feet from top of stream bank in the facilities' vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-year
floodplain elevation must be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not
designated, or no other evidence is provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
§ 187-27 BRADFORD CODE § 187-27
175:396
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage is provided.
(7) Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(8) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 3:1, and may be
further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(9) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 3:1.
(10) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
1% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(11) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
(12) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph, infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(13) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated, or piped, to an
acceptable point.
(14) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin. Minimal maintenance, saturation tolerant vegetation must
be provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(15) A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of the
municipality, for any stormwater management facility. The fence
shall be a minimum of four feet high, and of a material acceptable
to the municipality. A gate with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall
be provided for maintenance access.
(16) Principal outlet structures. The primary outlet structure shall be
designed to pass all design storms (up to and including the onehundred-
year event) without discharging through the emergency
spillway. All principal outlet structures shall:
(a) Be constructed of reinforced concrete or an alternative
material approved by the Municipal Engineer. When approved
for use, all metal risers shall:
§ 187-27 SEWERS § 187-27
175:397
[1] Be suitably coated to prevent corrosion.
[2] Have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be sufficient weight to prevent
flotation of the riser.
[3] Provide a trash rack or similar appurtenance to prevent
debris from entering the riser.
[4] Provide an anti-vortex device, consisting of a thin vertical
plate normal to the basin berm.
(b) Provide trash racks to prevent clogging of primary outflow
structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or
smaller in diameter.
(c) Provide outlet aprons and shall extend to the toe of the basin
slope at a minimum.
(d) Where spillways will be used to control peak discharges in
excess of the ten-year storm, the control weirs shall be
constructed to withstand the pressures of impounded waters
and convey flows at computed outlet velocities without erosion.
(17) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year postdevelopment peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure.
(b) Avoid locating on fill areas, whenever possible.
(c) The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the
one-hundred-year postdevelopment flow, with a blocked
primary outlet structure. Synthetic liners or riprap may be
used, and calculations sufficient to support proposed armor
must be provided. An earthen plug must be used to accurately
control the spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring
material. Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides
of the spillway, and continue at full width to a minimum of 10
feet past the toe of slope.
(d) The Municipal Engineer may require the use of additional
protection when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities
might exceed NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
§ 187-27 BRADFORD CODE § 187-27
175:398
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year
postdevelopment inflow) without structural failure, or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
(18) Stormwater management basins. Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be at least 10 feet.
(c) A ten-foot-wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.
(d) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. The
embankments will be constructed in a maximum of six-inch
lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density of 98% of a
standard proctor analysis as per each layer of compacted fill
shall be tested to determine its density analysis per ASTM 698.
Each layer of compacted fill shall be tested to determine its
density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Design details for placement of all outflow pipes and culverts
must include measures to prevent seepage (piping) through
the fill.
(19) Construction of stormwater management facilities.
(a) Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances, which
they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted
in the narrative and on the plan.
(b) Basins that include water quality or recharge components shall
have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(c) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to
the Municipal Engineer upon request.
§ 187-27 SEWERS § 187-27
175:399
(d) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
(20) Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
the municipality for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a
much smaller scale than traditional stormwater management
facilities.
C. Stormwater-carrying facilities.
(1) All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and
other stormwater-carrying facilities that service drainage areas
within the site must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff from
the ten-year design storm.
(2) Stormwater management facilities that convey off-site water
through the site shall be designed to convey the twenty-five-year
storm event (or larger events, as determined by the Municipal
Engineer).
(3) All developments shall include provisions that allow for the
overland conveyance and flow of the postdevelopment onehundred-
year storm event without damage to public or private
property.
(4) Storm sewers.
(a) Storm sewers must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff
without surcharging inlets for the ten-year storm event.
(b) When connecting to an existing storm sewer system, the

exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that
adequate downstream capacity exists.
(c) Inlets, manholes, pipes and culverts shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications set forth in PennDOT's
Publication 408, and as detailed in PennDOT's Publication
72M, Standards for Roadway Construction (RC), or other detail
approved by the Municipal Engineer. All material and
construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe trenches, etc.),
must be shown on the SWM site plan, and a note added that all
construction must be in accordance with PennDOT's
Publication 408 and PennDOT's Publication 72M, latest
edition. A note shall be added to the plan stating that all
frames, concrete top units and grade adjustment rings shall be
set in a bed of full mortar according to Publication 408.
(d) A minimum pipe size of 18 inches in diameter shall be used in
all roadway systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in the municipality. Pipes shall be designed to
§ 187-27 BRADFORD CODE § 187-27
175:400
provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second when
flowing full, but in all cases the slope shall be no less than
0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be

conflict conditions exist.
(e) All storm sewer pipes shall be laid to a minimum depth of one
foot from subgrade to the crown of pipe.
(f) In curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment of
water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb
during the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration.
Gutter depth shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity
calculations that account for road slope and opening area.
[1] Inlets shall be placed at a maximum of 600 feet apart.
[2] Inlets shall be placed so drainage cannot cross
intersections or street center lines.
(g) Standard type "C" inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used
along curbed roadway networks. Type "C" inlets with ten-inch
hoods that provide a two-inch sump condition may be used
with approval of the Municipal Engineer when roadway
longitudinal slopes are 1.0% or less.
(h) For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe's
crown shall be at a higher elevation.
(i) All inlets shall provide a minimum two-inch drop between the
lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert
elevation.
(j) On curbed sections, a double inlet shall be placed at the low

side of the low point at a distance not to exceed 100 feet, or at
an elevation not to exceed 0.2 feet above the low point.
(k) At all roadway low points, swales and easements shall be
provided behind the curb or swale and through adjacent
properties to channelize and direct any overflow of stormwater
runoff away from dwellings and structures.
(l) All inlets in paved areas shall have heavy-duty, bicycle-safe
grating. A note to this effect shall be added to the SWM site
plan or inlet details therein.
(m) Inlets must be sized to accept the specified pipe sizes without
knocking out any of the inlet corners. All pipes entering or
exiting inlets shall be cut flush with the inside wall of the inlet.
§ 187-27 SEWERS § 187-27
175:401
A note to this effect shall be added to the SWM site plan or
inlet details therein.
(n) Inlets shall have weep holes covered with geotextile fabric

where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all
vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding 5°, and at all
points of convergence of two or more storm sewer pipes.
(r) All storm drainage piping shall be provided with either
reinforced concrete headwalls or end sections compatible with
the pipe size involved at its entrance and discharge.
(s) Outlet protection and energy dissipaters shall be provided at
all surface discharge points in order to minimize erosion
consistent with the PennDOT Publication 13M, or with FHWA
Publication HEC 14. Flow velocities and volumes from any

§ 187-27 BRADFORD CODE § 187-27
175:402
§ 187-28. Calculation methodology.
swales. Documentation must be provided to support velocity
and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Swale bends.
[1] Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or
shear stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor
for the purpose of designing swale erosion protection:
[a] 1.75: when swale bend is 30° to 60°.
[b] 2.00: when swale bend is 60° to 90°.
[c] 2.50: when swale bend is 90° or greater.
[2] Design of channels to handle flow around bends also
should include consideration of superelevation of the
water surface and wave runup using HEC-11.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Methods shall be selected by the design professional based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.06
2 2.46
10 3.46
§ 187-27 SEWERS § 187-28
175:403
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
25 4.11
50 4.64
100 5.21
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-HMS: no size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C133).
§ 187-28 BRADFORD CODE § 187-28
175:404
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C). Curve
numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CN's should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious area conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundredyear
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication
method or modified puls method. The design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the postdevelopment one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Municipal
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment  NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/0.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
133. Editor's Note: Stormwater Management Design Criteria.
§ 187-28 SEWERS § 187-28
175:405
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S
= [(1000/CN) - 10]
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
(b) Postdevelopment; commercial, industrial or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area): NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(c) Postdevelopment; residential, cluster or other low impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The postdevelopment Tc shall never be greater that the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the postdevelopment Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
postdevelopment watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc can not be assumed
for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the
postdevelopment analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should
not be directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
§ 187-28 BRADFORD CODE § 187-28
175:406
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, Manning's Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes and storm sewers. Manning's Equation should not be
used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all
inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
K. The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
L. The municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
municipality.

ARTICLE IX
Easements
§ 187-29. Easement standards and requirements.
A. Easements shall be established to accommodate the existence of
drainageways.
B. Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream, there shall be provided an easement paralleling the line of such
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream with a width adequate to
preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage in the one-hundredyear

regulations, the lot areas shall be not less than the minimum areas
required in the zoning regulations.
(6) Where corner lots rear upon lots facing the side street, the corner
lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the establishment of
front building lines on both the front and the side of the lots
adjoining the streets. Extra width should be provided on all corner
lots irrespective of whether they rear upon lots facing the side
streets.
G. Building lines. Building lines shall be shown on all plats of lots intended
for residential use of any character and on commercial or industrial lots
immediately adjoining residential areas. In all cases, building lines shall
be no less than required by any zoning or building line regulation
applying to the property. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning
control, the subdivider shall establish building lines in accordance with
the needs of each addition. It is suggested that building lines not be less
than twenty-five (25) feet from the right-of-way of the street or highway
upon which the lot fronts, except that on side streets not used as lot

A. Character of the development. The City Council, Mayor and then the
Planning Commission shall confer with the subdivider regarding the
type and character of development and may agree with the subdivider
as to certain minimum restrictions to prevent the construction of
substandard buildings, which, unless so controlled, might lessen the
value of the proposed subdivision and adjoining property.
B. Parks, school sites and other common areas. In subdividing property,
consideration shall be given to suitable sites for schools, parks,
playgrounds and other common areas for public use. Any provision for
schools, parks and playgrounds should be indicated on the preliminary
plan in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such
areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the appropriate agency.
C. Easements along streets. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall dedicate an adequate easement along each side of the
stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving or
protecting the stream or for drainage, parkway or recreational use.
§ 191-5 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 191-6
191:453
§ 191-7. Variations and exceptions.
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is one (1) acre or less in area or
whenever, in the opinion of the City Council and the Commission, it is
of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or
unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained
in these rules would result in real difficulties and substantial hardships or
injustices, the City Council and the Commission may vary or modify such
requirements so that the subdivider is allowed to develop his property in a
reasonable manner but also so that, at the same time, the public welfare
and interests of the city and surrounding area are protected and the general
intent and spirit of these rules are preserved.
§ 191-8. Administration and amendment.
These provisions shall be considered the minimum requirements for the
protection of the public welfare, and the City Council, through the Planning
Commission, reserves the right to modify or to extend them as may be
deemed necessary for the public good.
D. Bench mark. A permanent bench mark shall be accessibly placed, the
location and elevation of which shall be accurately noted on the
subdivision plat.
E. Street and sidewalk improvements. The rights-of-way shall be graded
(except in cases where unusual topographic conditions do not permit)
at time of construction for their full width to provide suitable finish
grades for pavement, sidewalks and planting strips, with adequate
surface drainage and convenient access to the lots and the roadway
improved by surfacing according to minimum standards established by
the governing Municipal Engineer.

§ 196-16. Levy of tax; effective date; maximum per person.
§ 196-17. Exemption and refunds.
A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with a primary place of employment within the
political subdivision during the tax year. Each natural person who
exercises such privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall
pay the tax for that year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro-rata
basis, in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. This tax may be used solely for the following purposes as the same may
be allocated by the City of Bradford from time to time:
(1) Emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services;
(2) Road construction and/or maintenance;
(3) Reduction of property taxes; or
(4) Property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and
farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A., Chapter 85,
Subchapter F, (relating to homestead property exclusion).
C. The political subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived
from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other
taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision.
D. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.

Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for a given
calendar year becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year
under Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
§ 196-17 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 196-17
191:471
§ 196-18. Duty of employers to collect.
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Treasurer, in consultation with the Treasurer and DCED,
shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures
shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating
to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day
the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the
calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Treasurer shall determine eligibility for exemption
and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Treasurer. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
§ 196-17 BRADFORD CODE § 196-18
191:472
§ 196-19. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Treasurer. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 196-20. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Treasurer on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 196-18B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 196-18 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 196-21
191:473
§ 196-21. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Treasurer on
or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 196-22. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 196-23. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 196-24. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to accept and receive payments of
this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by
§ 196-21 BRADFORD CODE § 196-24

or his/her authorized representative/agent shall have the right to
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of McKean County as in other
cases provided. [Amended 11-26-2013 by Ord. No. 3207.2]
C. The Treasurer or his/her authorized representative/agent is hereby
authorized to examine the books and payroll records of any employer in
order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby
directed and required to give the Treasurer the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination. [Amended 11-26-2013 by Ord.
No. 3207.2]
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Treasurer and/or his agent
may sue for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this
article, together with interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
§ 196-24 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 196-26
191:475
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 196-27. Interpretation of provisions.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

VIOLATION TICKETS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Property maintenance  See Ch. 163.
§ 212-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Alternative Dispute
Resolution Ordinance of The City of Bradford, McKean County,
Pennsylvania."
§ 212-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a mechanism by means of
issuance of tickets rather than citation to permit a citizen who believes he
may have been in violation to pay the ticket rather than cause the issuance
of a citation and a costly and protracted legal hearing before a Judge and
unnecessary appeals. The resolution in this manner is beneficial from a twofold
perspective in that it permits the City to maintain and enforce its laws
and permits a citizen so accused to resolve the dispute in a manner that
does not unduly burden the resident by requiring the issuance of a citation
and a court hearing. It also does not deprive the citizen of the right to
dispute the ticket and receive the full benefit of procedural and substantive
due process of law.
§ 212-3. Enforcement.
A. The provisions of any article so enumerated may be enforced by police
officers, code enforcement officers, or any public officer sworn to
uphold and enforce the law of the municipality.
B. The City Council may, from time to time, change, increase or decrease
those sections to be covered under this alternative dispute resolution
ordinance by resolution passed at a regular bimonthly City Council
meeting from time to time; however, at the time of the adoption of this
chapter, the City's Property Maintenance Code175 is hereby deemed and
ordained to be under the jurisdiction of this process, except any fees
which will be examined and amended on an annual basis. [Amended
4-28-2015 by Ord. No. 3225.1]
C. Any violation of the provisions of any article as enumerated in this
chapter may be cause for a notice of violation, violation ticket, or
citation to be issued to the violator.

§ 212-5. Violation ticket disposition.
A person in receipt of a violation ticket shall have 10 days within which time
to pay the amount stated on the ticket. In the event the ticket is not paid
within 10 days, such failure to pay shall result in the issuance of a criminal
citation for the offense with the local District Justice.
A. The notice of violation shall be in writing and shall identify the property
address, include a clear and concise statement of the violation(s),
specify the maximum time frame to take corrective action to bring the
property into compliance with the City's Property Maintenance Code176
and any other laws of the City of Bradford and commonwealth and
detail the fine for nonpayment of the ticket within the prescribed time
frame.
B. The Code Enforcement Official shall serve the notice of violation to the
violator by one of the following methods:
(1) By handing the notice of violation to the violator.
(2) By handing the notice of violation to be served to an adult member
of the household or other person in charge of the residence at the
residence of the person to be served.
(3) By leaving or affixing the notice or violation ticket to the property
where the violation exists.
(4) By handing the notice of violation to the violator's agent or to the
person in charge thereof at any office of usual place of business of
the violator.
(5) By mailing the notice to the violator's address of record first class
mail with a certificate of mailing.
C. If the violation is not addressed to the satisfaction of the Code
Enforcement Officer within the allotted number of days from the
issuance of the notice of violation, the Code Enforcement Official shall
issue a violation ticket to the violator consistent with the service of
process described in § 212-4B above. The violation ticket shall be in
writing and shall identify the property address, include a clear and
concise statement of the violation(s), specify the maximum time frame
to take corrective action to bring the property into compliance with the
City's Property Maintenance Code177 and other state and local codes
and detail the fine for the nonpayment of the ticket within the
prescribed time frame.

Water Service; Rules and Regulations
[Adopted 6-11-1974 by Ord. No. 2956]
§ 216-1. Copies of schedule; rules and regulations.
§ 216-2. Application for service connection.
Any property owner desiring water service must make application on the
form furnished by the Water Department; said form may be signed by
the owner or his authorized agent. All applications made for a service
connection and meter outside of the limits of the City of Bradford must be
approved or disapproved by councilmanic action.
§ 216-3. Application for water service.
A. Copies of the schedule of water rates and charges established by formal
action of City Council and of the rules and regulations governing the
operations of the Water Department are open to inspection at the City
Hall, 24 Kennedy Street, Bradford, Pennsylvania.
B. These rules and regulations, which have been adopted by the city, are a
part of the contract with every person, corporation, company or
political subdivision who or which desires water service, and they, by
signing for the service, agree to be bound thereby and should
understand that the water supply will be furnished subject to
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources rules and
regulations.
A. The prospective customer or the duly authorized agent thereof will
make signed application for water service upon the Water Department's
printed form provided therefor, and, if approved by the Water
Department, water will be supplied in conformity with the class, scope
and type of service appertaining to the customer's premises as set forth
in the application and only at the rate schedule applicable thereunto.
The customer's application for service duly approved by the Water
Department, together with these rules and regulations, constitute the
contract between the customer and the Water Department;
nevertheless, the acceptance and use of water service at any premises
by an occupant without formal application therefor obligates the
occupant as the contractual party and he is bound thereby as the
customer. When requested in writing by the property owner, an
application for a supply of water may be received from a tenant under
the condition that the owner act as guarantor for the payment of all bills
rendered. If the tenant neglects to make such payments within the time
specified in § 216-19 of this chapter, it will be the responsibility of the
owner to make such payments.
B. A new application must be made to the Water Department and approved
thereby upon any change in the identity of the customer at any

A customer is the party contracting for a supply of water to a property as
hereinafter classified, i.e.:
§ 216-5. Permit required to supply other persons or premises.
No owner or tenant of any premises supplied with water by the Department
will be allowed to supply other persons or families or other premises except
by written permit from the Water Department. Customers who violate this
rule may have their water shut off after notice of five days, and it may
remain so until the Water Department is satisfied that the rules and
regulations will be observed.

premises or in the service described in the appurtenant application, and
the Water Department, upon five days' notice, may discontinue water
service until such new application has been made and approved.
C. Service will be renewed under a proper application when the conditions
under which such service was discontinued are corrected and upon the
payment of all charges provided in the schedule of water rates and
charges or in the rules and regulations.
D. When application is made for temporary use of water, requiring a
temporary connection, the cost of installation and removal of such
temporary facilities shall be borne by the applicant.
A. A building under one roof, owned or leased by one party and occupied
as one residence or business;
B. A combination of buildings owned or leased by one party in one
common enclosure and occupied by one family or business;
C. The one side of a double house having a solid vertical partition wall;
D. Each side or part of a building occupied by more than one family or
business, even though the closet and other fixtures may be used in
common; or
E. Each apartment, office or suite of offices located in a building having
several apartments, offices or suites of offices and using in common one
or more means of entrance, except that an owner of an apartment
house or building accommodating families or businesses may become
responsible for all water used on the premises, and such owner shall be
considered as the customer.
A. A deposit may be required from any customer desiring temporary
service for less than a thirty-day period in an amount equal to the
estimated gross bill for the limited period. The Water Department
reserves the right at any time to require a deposit from any regular

service customer in an amount equal to the estimated charges for any
single billing period (not exceeding three months) plus one month, but
not less than $5, as security for payment of service bills as accrued,
whenever the credit of the customer has not been established or
thereafter properly maintained as evidenced by service discontinuance
incurred under § 216-10 of this chapter.
B. Deposits may be returned to the depositor when he has established his
credit to the satisfaction of the Water Department.
C. The deposit will not bear interest.
D. Any customer having a deposit shall pay bills for water service as
rendered, in accordance with the rules and regulations, and the deposit
shall not be considered as payment on account of a bill during the time
the customer is receiving water service.
A. The Water Department will make all connections to its mains and
furnish and install all service lines from the main to and including the
curb box and stop, which will be placed inside the curbline, for the
following fee: cost of material and labor plus 20%, including the cost of
any state or municipal permit required for the opening of any street or
highway.
B. All of the service lines will be the property of the Authority and under
the control of the Water Department. No service connection will be
installed during the period that street openings are prohibited by
municipal regulations or at any time when, in the judgment of the Water
Superintendent, working conditions are unfavorable for installation,
either by reason of weather, temperature, conditions of soil or
otherwise. The Water Department will be responsible for the
maintenance and repairs of the service line between the main and the
curb stop.
C. The location of the service will be designated by the Water Department,
and no service line shall occupy the same trench with any facility of a
public service company or be within three feet of any open excavation
or vault unless such installation plan shall have been previously
authorized and approved by the Water Department as evidenced by its
written permission.
D. When it is necessary to renew an existing service line from the street
main to the curb stop, the Water Department will renew said service
line of the same size in the same location as the old one; but if the
applicant for his own convenience desires the new service line at some
other location and agrees to pay all expenses of cutting off the old
service line at the main, the Water Department will lay the new service
line at the location desired, except where the existing service is not on
the owner's property or where in the opinion of the Water

Superintendent the renewal would work a hardship on the owner by
reason of being under a driveway or other improvement.
E. When the customer desires a change in location or size of an existing
service line, the cost of the change shall be borne by the customer.
F. In all installations or replacements of service lines, only one premises of
one customer will be permitted to be supplied through one service pipe;
if one premises of one customer shall have one structure so divided by
partition walls to permit separate ownership at any time of the several
divisions of the structure or shall have two or more separate and
distinct structures thereon susceptible of more than one and the same
ownership, the Water Department will provide two or more separate
service stops as may be required at the termination of one service
connection of ample capacity, and the customer will be required to
install accordingly two or more separate service lines.
A. All service lines from the curb stop to the premises shall be installed at
the expense of the customer and remain an appurtenance of the
premises to be supplied and accordingly maintained in proper
condition; the service line shall comply with Water Department
specifications for size, material and location or otherwise have Water
Department approval and shall be laid at a minimum depth of 42 inches
throughout its length and shall terminate in a brass stop and waste stop
of approved pattern within the premises at a point easily accessible to
the occupant at all times for protection against leaks and freezing in
piping of the premises and to facilitate repairs thereto.
B. All leaks in the customer's service lines shall be promptly repaired by
the customer; upon failure to make repairs with reasonable dispatch
after due notice, the Water Department may discontinue water service,
which will not be restored until all proper and necessary expense
incurred by the Water Department in the discontinuance and
restoration of water service to the premises involved shall have been
paid to the Water Department by the offending customer.
C. Under no circumstances will the Water Department be responsible for
maintenance of the service lines or any piping or fixture on the
premises supplied, other than the Water Department's own specific
property, or for damage caused by water escaping therefrom, and the
customer shall invariably comply with state and municipal regulations
with reference thereto and shall make any changes therein necessitated
by reason of change of grade in street or sidewalk, relocation of
distribution main or otherwise.
D. All underground service lines in sizes from three-fourths (3/4) inch to
two inches shall be Type K soft copper to be buried a minimum depth of
3.5 feet.

common service line, any violation of the rules and regulations by any one
occupant shall be deemed a violation by all, and the Water Department may
take necessary action accordingly as provided by the rules and regulations,
except that water service to the premises shall be continued until the
customer has been given a reasonable opportunity to install a separate
service line for each occupant in compliance with § 216-7 of this chapter.

A. Water will be turned off at any premises upon order of the customer
without in any way affecting the existing contract.
B. Service under any contractual application or special contract, including
public fire protection service and any other municipal use, may be
discontinued after due notice for any one of the following reasons as
may be applicable:
(1) For misrepresentation in the application as to property interest or
service.
(2) For the use of water for any other property or purpose than that
described in the application.
(3) For failure to maintain, in good order, connections, service lines or
fixtures for which the customer or owner is responsible.
(4) For molesting any service pipe, meter, curb stop or seal or any
other appliance of the Water Department.
§ 216-8 WATER § 216-10
216:575
§ 216-11. Opening and closing valves and curb stops.
The operation of a service stop or valve is absolutely prohibited to anyone
other than an employee of the Water Department in the regular line of duty,
except that a regularly licensed plumber will be permitted to operate the
same when necessary in conjunction with his proper work on the relevant
premises, but he shall invariably leave the stop or valve in the same position
as found.
§ 216-12. Supply of water.
(5) For willful or careless waste of water by reason of improper,
impaired or deteriorated piping, fixtures or otherwise, such as
leaving the water running to prevent freezing of the house lines.
(6) For nonpayment of any account, fee or charge within 10 days after
expiration of the period allowed for payment.
(7) In case of unreported vacancy of premises.
(8) For violation of any rule of the Water Department.

(11) For refusal to conserve water during periods of restricted supply.
(12) For failure to pay water bills or charges at a prior location.
(13) As required by law when so directed by the Sanitary Authority.
C. As necessity may arise in case of break or rupture of any main, any
emergency or other unavoidable cause, the Water Department shall
have the right to temporarily suspend the water supply in order to make
necessary repairs, connections or installations; however, the Water
Department will use all practicable and reasonable measures to afford,
whenever possible, advance notice of such interruption of service.
D. However, the Water Department will not be liable for any damage or
inconvenience suffered by customers or occupants of premises
supplied, nor in any case will the Water Department be liable for any
claim against it at any time for interruption in service, inadequate
supply or pressure, quality of water or for any cause reasonably beyond
its control.
A. The Water Department shall have the right to reserve a sufficient supply
of water at all times in the reservoirs to provide for fire protection and
other emergencies or to restrict or regulate the quantity of water used

at customers' premises in cases of scarcity or whenever the public
welfare may require such action.
B. The Water Department reserves the right to suspend the use of
fountains and hose for sprinkling streets and yards, washing cars, etc.,
whenever in the opinion of the Water Department public exigency
requires it. The Water Department shall not be liable for failure to
supply water at any time, provided that such failure shall not be due to
negligence upon its part.
A. Contractors, builders or others will be required to make application to
the Water Department before using water for any of their several
construction purposes. The Water Department may require a guaranty
deposit from contractors and builders.
B. Water for such purposes, at the option of the Water Department, may be
furnished by metered service. The Water Department will install and
disconnect the meter, the charge for which shall be cost plus 20%,
payable at the time the permit is granted.
A. All industrial and commercial customers inside the City of Bradford
shall be serviced through meters. Domestic customers will be charged
on a flat-rate basis, unless a meter is requested by the owner.
B. All customers on the system outside of the boundaries of the City of
Bradford will be served through a meter.
C. Inside the city, the Water Department will furnish the meter to be
installed by the customer. Outside the city, the domestic customer will
pay $45 for the use of the meter; however, the meter remains in the
ownership of the Bradford City Water Department. Meters shall be
accessible to the Water Department at all reasonable hours and shall be
subject to its control exclusively. The Water Department only shall
possess the right to determine the style and size of the meter to be
installed.
D. Metered service contemplates the supply of water through an
individual service line and meter to each and every occupant of the
premises supplied. Where the premises are not adapted for such
separate meter installations in the judgment of the Water Department,
one common service line will be permitted and one meter installation
will be made accordingly; however, the charge for service will be made
on the same basis as if an individual meter were installed for each and
every occupant of the premises.
E. The meter will be set after the customer has had the plumbing arranged
to receive the meter at a convenient point approved by the Water
Department so as to control the entire supply, and a proper place and

waste.
protection for the meter shall be provided by the applicant. In cases
where it is not practical to place the meter within a building, a brick
or concrete pit with a suitable iron cover, or other approved meter
box, shall be built inside the property line by the customer. The size
and dimensions of the pit or box shall be as approved by the Water
Department, give adequate access to the meter and permit its
installation or removal.
F. Meters will be maintained by the Water Department so far as ordinary
wear is concerned, but loss or damage due to freezing, hot water or any
other external cause shall be paid by the customer. Where hot water or
heating systems or boilers are so constructed that there is a possibility
of hot water being forced back through the meter, the customer shall
protect the meter by installing a check valve on the outlet side of the
meter and shall for his own protection insert a safety valve in
connection with the hot water or heating system. The Water
Department will not be liable for any damage due to the failure of a
customer's safety valve.
G. The charge for the reinstallation or changing of a meter when removed
because of damage in any way due to the negligence of the customer
shall be $5 for meters one inch in diameter and smaller and $4 per inch
in diameter or fraction thereof for meters larger than one inch, which
charges shall include testing of the repaired meter.
H. If at any time a customer shall question the accuracy of the meter, upon
his request, accompanied by the deposit of the required fee, the Water
Department will test the same and adjust the matter as provided in the
following rule: If the meter so tested shall be found to be accurate
within the limits herein specified [4%], a fee determined from the
schedule below178 shall be paid to the Water Department by the
consumer requiring such test, but if not so found then the cost thereof
shall be borne by the Water Department furnishing the service. The
amount of the fee shall be $5 for each water service meter for an outlet
not exceeding one inch. For other water service meters having an outlet
not exceeding two inches the test fee shall be $10 per meter.
I. Larger meters shall be tested at cost.
J. In no case will correction of billing for meter inaccuracy be made for a
longer period than two months prior to date of the test unless the Water
Department is satisfied that inaccuracy has been of longer duration.

§ 216-16. Leaks and defective plumbing.
The Water Department shall not be liable for any damage resulting from
leaks, broken pipes or from any other cause occurring to or within any
house or building, and it is expressly stipulated by and between the Water
Department and the customer that no claims shall be made against the
Water Department on account of bursting or breaking of any main or service
pipe or any attachment to said waterworks.

§ 216-18. Responsibility for service.
It shall be expressly understood and agreed by and between the customer
receiving service and the Water Department that the Water Department
does not assume any liability as insurers of property or person and that
the agreement does not contemplate any special service, pressure, capacity
or facility other than the ordinary or the changing conditions of the water
supply system of the Water Department, as the same exist from day to day.
The Water Department hereby declares that it is agreed by the customer by
acceptance of service that the Water Department shall be free and exempt
from any and all claims for injury or damage to persons or property on
customers' premises or to any other person or property by reason of fire,
water or failure of water supply in pressure or capacity.
§ 216-19. Bills and payment. [Amended 11-23-1976 by Ord. No.
2983]
A. Bills as rendered for any indicated period or service, either special,
monthly or quarterly, will show the proper charge therefor as
determined by the applicable rate schedule and also the amount of any
abatement or deduction allowed or any fee or additional charge due and
payable under the rules and regulations. Bills shall be considered as
duly rendered when delivered at, or mailed to, the recorded address of
the customer as afforded by him for that purpose or otherwise the
premises supplied; nonreceipt of a bill shall never constitute a waiver
thereof; the Water Department at any time will issue a duplicate bill
upon proper request, and no claim for exemption from assessment or
delayed-payment charge for any reason whatsoever will be entertained
or allowed. All bills for flat-rate water service are due and payable on
the first day of each month for which service is furnished. No credit for
vacancies will be allowed unless the coupon is returned by the 10th of
the month for which vacancy is claimed. An eight-dollar service charge
shall be made for restoring of service where water has been turned off
for the nonpayment of bills and for the convenience of the owner
working on waterlines. Payment mailed, as evidenced by the United
States Post Office mark, on or previous to the last day of the month will
be deemed by the Water Department to be a payment of the bill within
the month. Charges for temporary use shall be payable on demand.
B. The bill for repairs or replacement of damaged meter installations or
parts thereof will be rendered to the responsible party, either occupant
of premises or customer, and in case payment of the same is not made
within 30 days after presentation of the bill the Water Department may
shut off and discontinue the supply of water to the premises until all
proper charges are paid, nor shall such action by the Water Department
preclude or stay collection of the damage bill by process of law.
C. In case the Water Department has been unable for any reason to obtain
the meter reading at the regular meter reading period, the Water
Department reserves the right to regularly bill the customer for an
estimated consumption so indicated on the bill, which estimated

charge for restoration of service; use of water for steam generation;
access to premises. [Amended 11-23-1976 by Ord. No. 2983]
consumption shall be deducted from the recorded consumption at the
subsequent meter reading period, and the bill for the subsequent
period shall be rendered accordingly.
D. Any customer, upon receipt of a bill, having reason to doubt its accuracy
shall bring or mail the bill within five days to the Water Department for
investigation.
A. The customer shall notify the Water Department in the event of
vacating of premises or closing the same temporarily, requesting the
Water Department to shut off the water. In such case the meter will be
read and bill rendered accordingly; however, at the option of the Water
Department when shutting off the water, the meter may be removed
and the account closed as of that date. Such notification shall be in
writing, delivered at the office of the Water Department on forms
available at the office of the Water Department.
B. Complaints with regard to the character of the service furnished or the
reading of meters or of the bills rendered must be made at the Water
Department office, whether verbally or in writing, and a record of such
complaint will be kept by the Water Department, giving the name and
address of the complainant, the date, the nature of the complaint and
the remedy.
C. A fee of $8, payable in advance, shall be made for turning on water in
restoration of service after discontinuance for nonpayment of bills or
vacancies.
D. Except for an emergency turnoff as determined by the city, for which no
charge shall be made, a service charge of $20, payable in advance, shall
be made for turning water off or on when the requested service is to be
made after regularly scheduled work hours, on weekends or on
holidays.
E. Customers using water for steam generation are warned not to depend
upon the hydraulic or hydrostatic pressure of the Water Department's
supply system for supplying such boilers. The Water Department will
not be responsible for any accident or damage in which such practices
frequently result. Steam and hot-water heating plants, also hot-water
generators and storage tanks, shall in all cases be provided with check
valves in the water supply piping to the same and other proper devices
to prevent damage or collapse if the water supply should be shut off or
should fail for any reason whatsoever. The Water Department will not in
any case be responsible for accident or damage resulting from the
imperfect installation or action of such devices or from the omission of
such installations.
§ 216-19 WATER § 216-20
216:581
§ 216-21. Main extensions.
Any person or persons requiring the extension of a street main in the area
served or to be served by the water system out of the corporate limits shall
enter a line deposit agreement with the City of Bradford Water Department.
The provisions of that agreement should include the following:
F. Any authorized employee of the Water Department, upon the
presentation of credentials if otherwise unknown, shall have
unrestricted access at all reasonable hours to any premises supplied
with water for the purpose of reading meters, making inspection or
securing such other information as may be deemed necessary for the
proper and efficient operation of the water system.
A. The person or persons shall deposit the full estimated cost of extending
the street main with the Water Department.
B. The deposit will not bear interest.
C. The Water Department will construct or contract to construct the
extension.
D. After construction of the extension, actual costs will be calculated and
the overpayment returned or the underpayment billed for.
E. One reimbursement will be made for each customer service line
connected to the extension set forth in the agreement, and no
reimbursements will be made after 10 years have passed from the date
of the agreement.
F. The waterline and all appurtenances thereto will become the property
of the Bradford City Water Authority upon completion.
G. The Water Department will operate and maintain the extension.
H. Each line extension agreement will stand on its own and not be
incorporated with any extension in another area or adjacent thereto.
I. The minimum size pipeline to be constructed in any public street or
right-of-way (Authority owned) will be six inches in diameter.
J. If a main larger than six inches is required for the depositor's
requirements, then the depositor will be required to pay for the larger
pipeline.
K. If the Water Department requires a larger pipeline than is needed for
the extension, the Authority and/or city will pay the difference between
the size required by the depositor and the size determined by the Water
Department.
L. Any customer desiring water service above sea level elevation (1,580
feet) will necessitate the installation of a pumping station. The total cost
of this installation shall be the responsibility of the customer, and a

Department at the time of installation.
A. No service will be rendered to any customer who has a private well
supply unless the same is disconnected from his system.
B. If, in the opinion of the Superintendent of the Water Department, a
particular use of water by a customer might cause contamination to the
public water supply, he may order the installation of a backflow
preventer.

§ 220-93. Buffer areas and landscaping.
required to submit data and evidence documenting that the proposed
activity, facility or use will comply with the provisions of this § 220-92.
In reviewing such documentation, the City of Bradford may seek the
assistance of any public agency having jurisdiction or interest in the
particular issues and the City of Bradford may seek advice from a
qualified technical expert. All costs of the expert's review and report
shall be paid by the applicant. A negative report by the technical expert

Appendix C for illustrations of buffer areas.190)
(1) Where Subsection B requires a ten-foot deep buffer area, the buffer
area shall be planted with a line of evergreen trees spaced 10 feet
apart measured from the vertical center lines of adjacent trees. The
trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height at the time of
planting.
(2) Where Subsection B requires a five-foot deep buffer area, the
buffer area shall be planted with a continuous, compact evergreen
hedge that is a minimum of six feet in height at the time of planting.
(3) In the event that a proposed development is unable to meet the
parking requirements for the proposed use and provide the buffer
area required by either Subsection A(1) or (2), above, or where
existing conditions on the lot such as paving or building location
make it impossible to provide the buffer area required by
Subsection A(1) and (2), above, a solid masonry wall or a solid
fence erected with the finished side facing the adjacent property
190. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 220-92 WATER § 220-93
216:723
may be substituted for the required buffer area. The minimum
height of the fence or wall shall be six feet.
(4) None of the required plantings shall encroach across any property
line. All plantings shall be located so that, at maturity, all parts of
the tree shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 feet from any public street
right-of-way or any property line that constitutes the exterior
boundary of the buffer area.
(5) In the event that existing vegetation and/or existing topography
provides screening that is adequate to meet the intent of the
required buffer area to screen the buildings, activities and parking
areas from adjoining properties, City Council, upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission, may determine that
the existing topography and/or vegetation constitutes all or part of
the required buffer area. If such a determination is made, the
applicant may be required to record a conservation easement of the
depth specified by City Council to guarantee that the existing
topography and/or vegetation will not be disturbed or removed
from the approved buffer area.
(6) In the case of a lot that is deeper than 400 feet, the requirement to
provide the buffer area along the entire perimeter of the lot may be
waived by City Council, provided the required buffer area is
installed along the side property lines and across the rear yard for a
distance sufficient to screen the buildings, activities and parking
areas from adjacent properties.
(7) Openings for driveways and pedestrian walkways shall be
permitted to cross a required buffer area. Plantings in required
buffer areas shall be located so as to not obstruct visibility for
traffic entering or leaving the site and shall be subject to the clear
sight triangle requirements of § 220-94D of this chapter.
(8) No structures or uses shall be permitted in the required buffer
area, other than fences, active or passive recreation facilities and
stormwater management facilities. Structures or uses not
permitted within the required buffer area include, but are not
limited to: buildings, principal uses (other than recreation),

or two-family dwelling is located, a five-foot buffer area, as
measured from the property line, shall be provided and landscaped
in accordance with the requirements of Subsection A.
C. Conflict between buffer area and yard requirements. When the width of
a required buffer area is in conflict with the minimum yard
requirements of Articles IV through XII, the greater distance shall
apply. The buffer area planting requirement shall be adhered to
regardless of the yard requirement.
D. Existing structures in buffer areas. In instances where an existing
structure is located within any required buffer area, the buffer area may
be reduced for the distance along the property line where the existing

to the lot, except where the access drives are proposed.
(3) Each parking space shall have access directly to a driveway.
Interior circulation of traffic shall be designed so that no driveway

entrance to the building it is intended to serve and evidence of a
lease agreement or cross-easement is submitted for any property
under different ownership proposed to be used for off-site parking.
If the off-site parking is not located on property contiguous to the
use it serves, the off-site parking shall be used to accommodate
employee parking, as well as customer parking and a means of safe
pedestrian access shall be provided.
(2) Parking authorized in front yards in the C-1, C-2, M-1 and M-2

setback, provided the plantings comply with the clear sight triangle
required by § 220-94D.
(4) Any trees planted adjacent to the public street right-of-way shall be
of a type authorized by § 202-7 of the City Code. Location and

structure. The surface area of the sign shall not exceed four square feet.
L. Lighting. If parking areas are proposed to be used during evening
hours, lighting shall be provided. Any lighting used to illuminate offstreet
parking areas shall be designed to reflect the light away from
adjoining properties in a C-D, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District and away from any
streets or highways. The lighting system shall furnish an average level
of not less than 0.5 footcandle during hours of operation and shall be
designed with cutoff luminaires that have a cutoff angle of 60° or less.
(See illustration in Appendix B.193) There shall be no spillover of
illumination at any property line adjoining property in a C-D, R-1, R-2 or
R-3 District in excess of 0.2 footcandle.

stormwater runoff shall not adversely affect adjacent properties.
Surface drainage shall be connected to the existing or proposed

ARTICLE XVII
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 220-122. Applicability.
This article shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as
defined by this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change
in the overall layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any
development, building, structure or part thereof for which official approval
and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto.
§ 220-123. Nonconforming uses.
These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any zoning
district that is a nonconforming use, as defined by this chapter. Whenever
the boundaries of a zoning district are changed so as to transfer an area
from one zoning district to another zoning district of a different
classification, these regulations shall apply to any uses that thereby become
nonconforming.
A. Continuation and sale. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of a lot or structure exists that
is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as
enacted or amended, such use may be sold or otherwise transferred to
other owners and may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. Enlargement or expansion.
(1) Single-family dwellings that are nonconforming uses in any
nonresidential zoning district classification may be enlarged or
expanded to occupy a greater area of the lot or to increase the
height of the dwelling, provided all applicable area and bulk
regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located
are met.
(2) No other nonconforming use of a lot or nonconforming use of a
structure shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a
greater area of the lot or structure than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board, after public hearing, shall interpret that the
enlargement or extension is necessitated by the natural expansion
and growth of the nonconforming use. Any such enlargement or
expansion shall conform to the area, height and yard requirements
of the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless authorized by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 220-122 WATER § 220-123
216:777
(4) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure that was designed for such use at the time the use
became nonconforming; however, a nonconforming use shall not be
extended to occupy any structure, lot or portion of a lot that was
not owned by the owner of the nonconforming use at the time the
use became nonconforming.
C. Change of use.
(1) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a
conforming use, except when authorized as a use by special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the
following standards:
(a) The new nonconforming use will more closely correspond to
the uses authorized in the district as permitted uses or uses by
special exception.
(b) The new nonconforming use will be in keeping with the
character of the neighborhood in which it is located and will
have an equal or lesser impact on the neighborhood than the
existing nonconforming use.
(c) Any change from one nonconforming use to another shall
comply with the parking requirements of Article XV for the new
use and shall be subject to the area, bulk and buffer area
regulations for such use in the zoning district where such use
is authorized as a permitted use or use by special exception.
(2) When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the use
thereafter shall not be changed to a nonconforming use.
(3) Where a nonconforming use exists on a lot, a conforming use shall
not be established on the same lot unless the nonconforming use is
discontinued.
D. Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot is
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the structure
and/or lot shall not thereafter be used, except in conformance with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
E. Damage or destruction.
(1) Residential dwellings that are nonconforming uses in the C-1, C-2,
M-1 or M-2 District may be rebuilt on the existing foundation in the
event of damage or destruction, provided the reconstruction is
started within 18 months of the date of destruction.
(2) In the case of nonconforming uses, other than dwellings, in any
district, when damage or destruction of a structure in which the
nonconforming use is conducted involves 50% or less of the gross
floor area of the structure, repairs or reconstruction may be
undertaken, provided that such restoration is started within 18

this chapter, in all zoning districts.
months of the date of destruction. No enlargement or expansion of
the structure in which the nonconforming use is located shall be
undertaken unless the provisions of Subsection B are met.
(3) In the case of nonconforming uses, other than dwellings, in any
district, when the structure in which the nonconforming use is
conducted is damaged or destroyed by fire or other means to an
extent of more than 50% of its gross floor area, the structure shall
be reconstructed only to house a conforming use.
A. Structural alteration or enlargement. A nonconforming structure may
be enlarged or structurally altered, provided the enlargement or
alteration does not encroach any further into any required yard setback
than the existing nonconforming structure does and, further provided
that no new nonconformities are created. All other alterations or
enlargements shall require review by the Zoning Hearing Board and,
after public hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board may determine undue
hardship and may authorize a variance for the reasonable alteration or
enlargement of such structure.
B. Damage or destruction. Any nonconforming structure that has been
partially or completely damaged or destroyed by fire or other means
may be rebuilt or repaired on its existing foundation even though such
foundation may violate the setback requirements for the zoning district
in which the structure is located, provided that the repair or
reconstruction and reoccupancy of the structure occurs within 18
months of the date that the original structure was damaged or
destroyed. No enlargement or expansion of the nonconforming
structure shall be undertaken unless the provisions of Subsection A are
met.
C. Moving. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for
any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements
of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Signs.
(1) Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, provided
that no structural alterations are made that increase the gross
surface area of the sign; however, nonconforming signs that are
damaged or destroyed to an extent of more than 51% of their
replacement cost at the time of destruction shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. Replacement cost shall be determined by the City
Engineer upon request by the City Council. The City Engineer shall
inspect the sign and submit a report to the Zoning Officer within
§ 220-123 WATER § 220-124
216:779
§ 220-125. Nonconforming lots.

In the course of administering and enforcing this chapter and reviewing
applications for zoning certificates, temporary use permits, sign permits
or variances, the Zoning Officer shall register all nonconforming use,
nonconforming structures and nonconforming lots as they become known
through the application and enforcement process.
five working days of the City Council's request. The cost of the
services of the City Engineer shall be borne by the applicant. Said
cost shall not exceed the amount established from time to time by
resolution of City Council.
(2) Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged, added to or replaced
by another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that the
interchange of advertising panels shall be permitted, subject to
obtaining the sign permit required by § 220-146.
E. Repair or maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged
with protecting the safety of the public, provided all other requirements
of this § 220-124 are met.
A. Lot area or lot width. Any lot of record existing at the effective date of
this chapter may be used for the erection of a structure conforming to
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, without a
lot area or lot width variance, even though its lot area and width are
less than the minimum required by this chapter; provided, however,
that such lot shall comply with the front, rear and side yards, height and
lot coverage standards of the zoning district wherein it is located.
B. Front yard setback. Where structures exist on nonconforming lots of
record that have front yards that are less than the minimum depth
required, the minimum front yard for an adjacent vacant
nonconforming lot of record proposed to be built upon shall be the
average depth of the nonconforming front yards for the existing
structures on the adjacent nonconforming lots in the same block on the
same side of the street.

A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.

together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any
provisions of any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a
reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the

days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same
manner as provided in § 220-134A. If the Zoning Hearing Board shall

terms and conditions for:
(1) Funding mediation;
(2) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a working
knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision procedures and
demonstrated skills in mediation;

procedures set forth in this chapter.
C. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding the
final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as evidence in
any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.
A. Fees. City Council may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to
hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said hearings may
include compensation for the secretary, notice and advertising costs
and necessary administrative overhead connected with the hearing.
The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning
Hearing Board, expenses for engineering, architectural or other
technical consultants or expert witness costs.

§ 220-139. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the Zoning
Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance,
order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and
all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer
or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing
Board, facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the development or official action shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, that may be granted by
the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate
agency or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final,
has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than
Hearing Board or Hearing Officer or shall be paid by the person
appealing from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal
is made, and in either event the cost of additional copies shall be paid
by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
C. Expenditures. Within the limits of funds appropriated by City Council,
the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or contract for secretaries,
clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical services.
A. No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
later than 30 days after a preliminary or final application for
development has been approved by an appropriate City officer, agency
or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the
approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he
had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had
been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such
approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest.
B. The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of
an ordinance or map filed pursuant to § 916.2 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as amended),195 shall preclude
an appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final
submission substantially deviates from the approved preliminary
approval.
C. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.

District Map or any provision thereof, that prohibits or restricts the use or
development of land in which he has an interest.
A. Procedure. The landowner may submit a curative amendment to City
Council with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in Sections 609.1 and
1004 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as
amended.197 As with other proposed amendments, the curative
amendment shall be referred to the City Planning Commission and the
McKean County Planning Commission at least 30 days before the
hearing is conducted by City Council. Public notice shall be given in
accordance with Sections 610, 1004 and other applicable provisions of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.198 The hearings shall be

B. Evaluation of merits of curative amendment. If City Council determines
that a validity challenge has merit, City Council may accept a
landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or may
adopt an alternative amendment that will cure the alleged defects. City
Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning District Map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of the use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;

the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses that are essential to public health and welfare.
C. Declaration of invalidity by court. If the City does not accept a
landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with this
§ 220-149 and a court subsequently rules the challenge has merit, the
court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire chapter, but only for those provisions that specifically relate to
the landowner's curative amendment challenge.200

GENERAL REFERENCES
Administration of government  See Ch. 3.
§ A239-1. Purpose.
A. The citizens of the City of Bradford, Pennsylvania (hereinafter the
"city") have an imperative need to be free from diverse public nuisances
which injure, or which threaten to injure, their health, safety and
welfare, including, but not limited to, any inadequately protected well,
shaft, basement, excavation, abandoned or nondrivable motor vehicle
or equipment, structurally unsound fence or building, lumber, trash,
debris or vegetation, such as poison ivy, oak or sumac, or other
§ A238-1 BRADFORD CODE § A239-1
A239:906
§ A239-2. The Board.
The Board is the local agency with the duty and with the authority to, inter
alia, ascertain whether a public nuisance, as defined in 53 P.S. § 37320,
exists and to order it removed, abated, suspended, altered or otherwise
prevented or avoided.
§ A239-3. Agents of the Board.
The Health Officer, the Building Inspector, the Code Enforcement Officer
and all Health Department and code enforcement personnel employed by
the city shall be, and hereby are appointed, duly authorized agents of the
Board. They shall, inter alia, make such investigations, examinations and
reports as shall suffice to inform the judgment of the Board, and they shall
faithfully execute its orders.
§ A239-4. Orders of the Board.
condition which is or may be detrimental to the safety or health of
persons, any condition which may prove attractive but detrimental to
the health or safety of children, whether in a building on the premises
or upon an unoccupied lot, physical conditions dangerous to human life
or detrimental to the health of persons on or near the premises where
the conditions exist, whatever renders air, food or drink unwholesome
or detrimental to the health of human beings, fire hazards and any
public nuisance known at public law or in law or equity jurisprudence
or as provided by the statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or
the ordinances of the city.
B. Accordingly, these regulations of the city's Board of Health (as
prescribed in 53 P.S. § 37301, hereinafter the "Board") are promulgated
to better enable the city to remove, abate, suspend, alter, prevent or
avoid public nuisances, to better enable the city to recover any and all
costs pertaining to the removal, abatement, suspension, alteration,
prevention or avoidance of public nuisances, to ensure adequate notice
to property owners and to those responsible for public nuisances, to
afford property owners and those responsible for public nuisances an
opportunity to eliminate public nuisances at their own cost prior to the
imposition of fines, penalties and the costs of the city's abatement
action, to provide due process to persons adversely affected by orders
of the Board and to afford a record appeal to persons adversely affected
by formal action of the Board.
A. An order of the Board shall set forth the information prescribed by 53
P.S. § 37322.

determined, in an order of the Board, to be responsible for a nuisance.
C. An order of the Board shall provide that any and all expenses, costs and
charges shall be promptly and fully paid upon presentation. An order of

expenses, costs and changes upon presentation shall be a violation of
the Board's order within the meaning of 53 P.S. § 37340.

the Board and the city and any of their agents, employees,
representatives, experts and contractors to take any compliance action

by these regulations.
E. An order of the Board may also contain a directive that no person shall
obstruct, impede or otherwise interfere with the entry and conduct of

the public health is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. Whenever in
these regulations the words "public nuisance" or "nuisance" is used, they
shall be deemed to mean a nuisance detrimental to the public health unless
a different meaning is specified. The powers of investigation and entering
upon premises vested in the Board and its agents and employees pursuant
to its orders shall be available for the determination of public nuisances.
The agents of the Board are authorized to enter any structure or premises
at reasonable times to inspect, subject to constitutional restrictions on
unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not obtained, the
agents of the Board are authorized to pursue recourse as provided by law,
including, but not limited to, seeking the issuance of a search warrant.
§ A239-7. Procedure for the abatement of public nuisances.
Whenever the Board shall determine, after such examination, investigation
or hearing as shall suffice to inform its judgment, that a public nuisance
exists or is about to exist, it may order the nuisance to be removed, abated,
suspended, altered or otherwise prevented or avoided. Notice of such order,
bearing the official title and the official seal of the Board and the number
of days for compliance therewith and the alternative remedy of the Board
in case of noncompliance, shall be served upon the person, if any, whom
the Board deems responsible therefor or concerned therein, and upon the
owner or abutting owner of the land, premises or other places whereon such
a nuisance is or is about to be, if any. In case no such party or parties can
be discovered by the Board, the order shall be served by posting a copy or
copies thereof conspicuously upon the premises for a period of at least 10
days.
§ A239-8. Abatement of public nuisances by Board or city.
A. In any case where the persons ordered by the Board to abate or prevent
a public nuisance or anticipated public nuisance refuse or neglect to do
so within the time specified in the original or any subsequent order of
the Board, then, unless the said order shall have been suspended by a
proper appeal to the McKean County Court of Common Pleas and
proper bond posted, the Board may direct its Health Officer and
employees to execute said order; or if the execution of said order
requires the grading, paving or repaving of private alleys or any similar
work upon any property whatsoever within the city or any other work or
services that may best be performed or contracted for by the agencies
and employees of the city itself, then the Board shall certify its order to
City Council under its official seal, and Council shall thereupon proceed
to cause the execution of the order.
B. In any case where the Board or the Council thus abates or prevents or
causes the abatement or prevention of a public nuisance, the cost and
expense of such work, services and materials shall be charged to the
persons affected in their proper proportions; and upon nonpayment of
such charges, the city may file a lien therefor upon the affected
premises in the name of and for the use of the city, as provided by law

for municipal claims, in addition to the other remedies available for
collection of debts due the city. The lien shall attach as of the time the
work was commenced, which shall be fixed by the certificate of the
Health Officer or of the City Engineer filed with the City Clerk.
A. If a violation of the Building Ordinance, the Housing Ordinance, the
Property Maintenance Ordinance, the Fire Prevention Ordinance, the
Electrical Ordinance or the Plumbing Ordinance206 is determined by the
Board to constitute a nuisance in fact which poses a threat to the
public's health, safety or property and the person responsible for the
nuisance does not comply with the terms of the Board's order, said
noncompliance shall constitute a second violation if the continuing and
uncorrected nuisance in fact constitutes a violation of the same
subsection of any such ordinance on the same property. An order of the
Board may provide that, in such event, the person responsible for the
nuisance shall be fined not less than $500 nor more than $1,000.
B. Any order of the Board may further provide that, in the event the city
does not, for whatever reason, remove, abate, suspend, alter or
otherwise prevent or avoid the nuisance within five calendar days after
the compliance date set by the Board, the continuing and uncorrected
nuisance in fact which poses a threat to the public's health, safety or
property shall constitute a third violation if the continuing and
uncorrected nuisance in fact constitutes a violation of the same
subsection of such ordinance on the same property. Any order of the
Board may provide that, in such event, the person responsible for the
nuisance shall be fined not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000.
C. If the nuisance is not determined by the Board to constitute a nuisance
in fact which poses a threat to the public's health, safety and or
property based upon a violation of such ordinances, any order of the
Board may provide that, if the person responsible for the nuisance does
not comply with the terms of the Board's order, they shall be fined not
more than $1,000.
D. An order of the Board shall provide that any and all costs, charges and
expenses necessarily incurred in carrying these regulations into effect,
including, but not limited to, the costs of temporarily housing any
innocent persons displaced by an order of the Board and the costs of
proceedings incident thereto, shall be recoverable for the use of the
city.
E. In the event of noncompliance with any order of the Board, the city may
cause the removal, abatement, suspension or alteration of the nuisance
or otherwise prevent or avoid the nuisance and, thereafter, may, in the

§ A239-10. Criminal penalty for violation.
In addition to any fines imposed by the Board for noncompliance with its
orders, any person violating any order of the Board, or who shall obstruct
or interfere with any person in the execution of any order of the Board,
or willfully and illegally omit to obey any such order, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not
exceeding $100 or undergo imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or both,
at the discretion of the Court.

§ A239-12. Hearing and disposition.
If any person affected by an order of the Board shall apply for a hearing

interested parties of the time and place of the hearing. The Board shall
enter upon its minutes the facts and proofs as it may receive and its
proceedings on such hearing and thereafter may rescind, modify or reaffirm
its order and require execution of the original or of a new or modified order
as it shall determine and direct. The persons affected shall be notified of the
Board's final order and within 10 days from the mailing or personal delivery
of such notice may appeal therefrom to the Court of Quarter Sessions,
which appeal may operate as a supercedes if the Court, upon proper cause
shown, so orders, and provided that the appellants post bond, approved
by the Court, for the use of the city, with sufficient surety to cover all the
expense and costs of executing the Board's order.
§ A239-13. Appeals.
manner prescribed by law, recover any and all costs thereof, together
with a penalty of 10% per annum of such costs from the person
responsible for the nuisance.
A. Any order of the Board and any subsequent notice required to be given
by the Board pursuant to Article XXIII of the Third Class City Code and
these regulations shall conclusively be deemed to have been properly
served if a copy thereof is:
(1) Delivered personally; or
(2) Sent by certified or first class mail addressed to the party's last
known address.
B. In case no responsible parties or property owners can be discovered by
the Board, its order may be served by posting a copy or copies thereof
conspicuously upon the premises for a period of at least 10 days.
A. The application for an appeal hearing before the Board shall have
attached to it a copy of the Board's order. The application for an appeal
hearing shall precisely and thoroughly set forth, in separate numbered
§ A239-9 BOARD OF HEALTH REGULATIONS § A239-13
A239:911
paragraphs, any and all factual and legal bases upon which the person
adversely affected by the Board's order seeks to challenge said order at
the appeal hearing. The application for an appeal hearing shall set forth
the address to which the Board shall deliver notice of when and where
the appellant is to appear for the appeal hearing. The application for
an appeal hearing shall set forth the appellant's telephone number. Any
appellant from an order of the Board shall file a minimum of 10 copies
of his application for an appeal.
B. The request for an appeal hearing before the Board shall be filed with
the Secretary of the Board on the second floor of Bradford City Hall, 24
Kennedy Street, Bradford, Pennsylvania, 16701. Subject to the time
limitations set forth in the order of the Board, a request for an appeal
hearing before the Board may be filed by mail. Subject to the time
limitations set forth in the order of the Board, a request for an appeal
hearing before the Board may also be filed in person at the aforesaid
address Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and
4:30 p.m., prevailing time. Any request for an appeal hearing before the
Board which is received after the filing deadline shall be rejected as
untimely filed.
C. In all cases in which a corporation is a property owner of record or is
adversely affected by the order of the Board, all requests for hearings
before the Board shall be executed by an officer of said corporation,
stating the title of such officer, or by a duly authorized employee of the
corporation which shall be accompanied by a verified certification that
he is authorized to act on behalf of the corporation. In all cases in which
a partnership or sole proprietorship is a property owner of record or is
adversely affected by the order of the Board, a principal of such
business organization shall execute the request for an appeal hearing
before the Board.
D. The application for an appeal hearing, any subsequent communications
with the Board and any documents or written matter sought to be
introduced before the Board at the appeal hearing shall be submitted in
a minimum of 10 copies. The required number of copies of any and all
documentary evidence sought to be introduced before the Board shall
be delivered to the Secretary of the Board on the second floor of
Bradford City Hall, 24 Kennedy Street, Bradford, Pennsylvania 16701,
not later than 24 hours prior to the scheduled appeal hearing. Failure to
comply with this requirement shall, in the discretion of the Board,
constitute grounds to disqualify the proposed documentary evidence.
E. The Board will generally allow approximately one hour for an appeal
hearing. If the appeal hearing involves unusually complex issues of law
or fact, additional time may, in the discretion of the Board, be allotted
only if said request is made with the filing of an application for an
appeal hearing.
F. Failure of any person adversely affected by the Board's order to appear
at the appeal hearing, after due notice thereof, shall be considered an
§ A239-13 BRADFORD CODE § A239-13
A239:912
abandonment of the appeal hearing request and shall cause the
dismissal of the appeal. The Board may, at its discretion, grant an
appeal hearing continuance of no more than 30 days. All requests for
a continuance of any appeal hearing shall be made in writing and
shall, unless wholly impracticable, be filed with the Board at least five
business days before the date set for the appeal hearing. Said written
postponement request shall, in numbered paragraphs, precisely and
thoroughly set forth the grounds relied upon in support thereof.
G. The Board will not be bound by the strict rules of evidence normally
applied in the Courts. The Board may, in its discretion, hear any and all
evidence which it considers probative and helpful in deciding the
appeal hearing.
H. All parties will be required to exercise proper and appropriate decorum
during the appeal hearing. Eating and drinking, with the exception of
water for counsel and persons on the witness stand, are not permitted
in the hearing room. The Board's telephones are not available for use by
parties, counsel or witnesses unless calls are, in the judgment of the
Board, necessary to assure the orderly conduct of the appeal hearing.
All copying of materials required for the appeal hearing before the
Board shall be done by the parties prior to the hearing. When the need
for copies could not be anticipated beforehand, copies may be made on
the Board's copying machine at a cost of $2 per page and $10 per onehalf

the Board shall, unless excused, attend each appeal hearing of the
Board and shall furnish the Board with such information relating to the
nuisance as the Board may require.
A. When approved, printed and advertised by the City Council as required
in the case of ordinances, these regulations shall have the force of

of the Board, that these regulations would have been adopted had such

not been included herein.
