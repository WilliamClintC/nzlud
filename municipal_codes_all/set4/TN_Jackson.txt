PREFACE
This code is the result of a comprehensive codification of the ordinances
of the City of Jackson, Tennessee. By referring to the historical citation
appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to ascertain the old
code section or ordinance from which the particular section has been derived.
The absence of a historical citation means that the section was added at the time
the code was prepared. The word "modified" in the historical citation indicates
substantial modification of the original ordinance or ordinances.
The attention of the user is directed to the arrangement of the code into
titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter is kept together, so far as possible,
within the same title. Each section number is complete within itself, containing
the title number, the chapter number, and the section of the chapter of which
it is a part. Specifically, the first number is the title number followed by a
hyphen, then the chapter number with the last two numbers showing the
section number within the chapter, so that, for example, title 2, chapter 1,
section 6, is designated as § 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should readily find all provisions in the code relating to
any question that might arise.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance
for the code).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is furnished
to MTAS immediately after its adoption (see section 8 of the adopting
ordinance).
(3) That the city agrees to reimburse MTAS for the actual costs of
reproducing replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the
consultant's work, and reproduction costs are usually nominal).
iii
Presently, when the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce
replacement pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made
by such ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more
often if justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be
supplied with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the
code complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team: Emily Keyser, Program Resource
Specialist; and Linda Winstead, Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown,
Administrative Specialists, is gratefully acknowledged.

appended to the paper, but each signer shall add to his signature the street and

One of the signers on each such paper shall make oath that the
statements therein made are true, as he believes, and that each signature to the

required number of persons, and whether such persons are qualified voters as
shown by the registration books, and he shall attach to said petition his

municipal election is fixed to be held within ninety days, and at said special
election, if none is so fixed, said ordinance shall be submitted without alteration
to the qualified voters of the said City. The ballots used and voted upon said
ordinance shall contain these words "for the ordinance" stating the substance
of the proposed ordinance, and "against the ordinance," stating the substance
of the proposed ordinance.
If a majority of the qualified voters voting for the proposed ordinance
shall vote in favor thereof, such ordinance shall thereupon become as valid and
binding an ordinance of the City as if duly passed by the Council, and any
ordinance proposed by petition or which shall be adopted by a vote of the people,

proposed ordinances may be voted upon at the same election, in accordance with
the provisions of this section, but there shall not be more than one special
election in any period of twelve months for such purpose.
The Council may submit a proposition for the repeal of any ordinance or
for amendments thereto to be voted on at any succeeding general city election,
and should such proposition so submitted receive a majority of the votes cast
thereon at such election, such ordinance shall thereby be repealed or amended
accordingly. Whenever any ordinance or proposition is required by this Act to
be submitted to the voters of the City at any election, the Election Commission
shall cause such ordinance or proposition to be published in one of the daily
newspapers published in said City, such publication to be in not more than
twenty nor less than five days before the submission of such proposition or
ordinance to be voted on. [As amended by Pvt. Acts 1988, Ch. 190, Sec. 1 (Z)]

official or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.

interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-403. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An
official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the

2006)

discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the

policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter.

accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration or
favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
(2) That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business.
(Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-406. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity.
(Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-407. Use of municipal time, facilities, etc. (1) An official or
employee may not use or authorize the use of municipal time, facilities,
equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage to himself.
(2) An official or employee may not use or authorize the use of

municipality. (Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-408. Use of position or authority. (1) An official or employee may
not make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality.
(Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-409. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept
or continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
1-16
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipality's charter or any ordinance or policy.
(Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-410. Ethics complaints. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorney's
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request that the governing body hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipality's governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics.
(Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)
1-411. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipality's charter or other applicable law
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (Ord. #2006038, Oct. 2006)

reuse of the property for residential, commercial, industrial and related
use is in keeping with the comprehensive plan of redevelopment within
the city.

included in the report prepared by the commission to the city council.
2-16
(3) The commission shall notify the owner of the property or a
designated agent that a determination of blight or deterioration has been made
and that failure to eliminate the conditions causing the blight shall render the
property subject to condemnation by the city under this chapter. Notice shall be
mailed to the owner or designated agent by certified mail, return receipt
requested. However, if the address of the owner or designated agent is unknown
and cannot be ascertained by the commission in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, copies of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
property affected. The written notice sent to the owner or the owner's agent
shall describe the conditions that render the property blighted and deteriorated,
and shall demand abatement of the conditions within ninety (90) days of the
receipt of such notice.
(4) An extension of the ninety (90) day time period may be granted by
the commission if the owner or designated agent demonstrates that such period
is insufficient to correct the conditions cited in the notice. (Ord. #2001-044, Oct.
2001)
2-506. Eminent domain proceedings--findings required. (1) The
city council may authorize the city to institute eminent domain proceedings
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, title 29, chapters 16 and 17 against any

constitute a serious growing menace to the public health, safety and
welfare;

corrected;

deterioration of the property. (Ord. #2001-044, Oct. 2001)
2-507. Conflicts of interest. (1) No officer or employee of the city, or
of the vacant property review commission, who in the course of such officer's or
employee's duties is required to participate in the determination of property
blight or deterioration, shall acquire any interest in any property declared to be
blighted or deteriorated.
(2) If any such officer or employee owns or has a financial interest,
direct or indirect, in any property certified to be blighted or deteriorated, the
officer or employee shall immediately disclose, in writing, such interest to the
commission and to the city council, and such disclosure shall be entered in the
minutes of the commission and of the city council.
2-17
(3) Failure to so disclose such interest shall constitute misconduct in
office.
(4) No payment shall be made to any officer or employee for any
property or interest therein acquired by the city from such officer or employee
unless the amount of such payment is fixed by court order in eminent domain
proceedings, or unless payment is unanimously approved by the city council.

2-601. Created. There is hereby created and established a board for the
Community Redevelopment Agency. The board is hereby established shall
exercise all of the powers of the Community Redevelopment Agency as provided
in the Community Redevelopment Act of 1998. (Ord. #2009 005, April 2009)
2-602. Composition; terms; vacancies; compensation; removal.
The board of directors (board) shall consist of seven (7) members in which all
powers of the CRA are vested. All directors shall be residents of Madison
County, Tennessee. The directors shall serve as such without compensation
except that they shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses incurred in and
about the performance of their duties.
The board shall consist of seven (7) members. Five (5) of those members,
one (1) of which must be a serving city council member, shall be nominated by
the city mayor, subject to approval of the city council, and two (2) members, one
(1) of which must be a serving county commissioner, shall be nominated by the
county mayor, subject to the approval of the Madison County Commission.
The terms of office of the board shall be three members for three (3)
years-- two (2) city selected and one (1) county selected; three (3) members for
two (2) years -- two (2) city selected and one (1) county selected; and one (1)
member for one (1) year -- city selected. Thereafter, each member shall be
nominated by the respective mayor for a three (3) year term, subject to approval
by the appropriate legislative body, or until their successor is appointed and
qualified. In the event of a vacancy, whether by reason of resignation, death, or
other cause, the respective mayor, with approval of the appropriate legislative
body, may appoint a successor for such member only for the vacating member's
unexpired term.
The directors shall serve as such without compensation except that they
shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses incurred in and about the
performance of their duties.
The governing body may remove a director for inefficiency, neglect of
duty, or misconduct in office only after a hearing and only if he or she has been
2-19
given a copy of the charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and has
had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. In addition, if any
committee member is absent for three (3) consecutive meetings, the chairman
shall notify the governing body that appointed the member of the absences. The
governing body shall hold a hearing to determine if there is sufficient cause for
removal. The member shall be given a copy of the charges for at least ten (10)
days prior to such hearing. The member shall be given an opportunity to be
heard in person or by counsel before being officially removed. Upon a member
being removed, the governing body that removed the member shall appoint a
new member to fill the vacant seat at its next, eligible, regularly scheduled
meeting. Nothing in this section however, shall preclude the reappointment of
the removed member. (Ord. #2009 005, April 2009, as replaced by
Ord. #2009 011, July 2009)
2-603. Purpose. The purpose for which the CRA is created is to plan,
finance and implement development and redevelopment plans and projects
which will eliminate or prevent the effects of slum and blight within the
corporate limits of the City of Jackson by using some or all of the powers
identified and allowed under the State of Tennessee Community Redevelopment
Act of 1998.
It has been found and declared that there exist slum and blighted areas
which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health,
safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the City of Jackson; that the
existence of such areas contributes to the spread of crime, constitutes an
economic and social liability imposing burdens which decrease the tax base and
reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests sound growth, retards the
provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and that the
prevention and elimination of slums and blight is a matter of concern in order
that the City of Jackson shall not continue to be endangered by such area.
It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or
portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to
use restrictions, as provided in the State of Tennessee Community
Redevelopment Act of 1998, since the prevailing conditions of decay may make
impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that
other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided through the
State of Tennessee Community Redevelopment Act of 1998 may be susceptible
to conservation or rehabilitation; therefore slum or blighting conditions may be
eliminated, remedied or prevented.
It is further found that the powers conferred by the State of Tennessee
Community Redevelopment Act of 1998 to the Redevelopment Agency are for
public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the
power of eminent domain and police power exercised.
It is further found that the preservation or enhancement of the tax base
from which a taxing authority realizes tax revenues is essential to its existence
2-20
and financial health; that tax increment financing is an effective method of
achieving such preservation and enhancement in areas in which such tax base
is declining; that community redevelopment in such areas, when completed, will
enhance such tax base and provide increased tax revenues to all affected taxing
authorities.
It is further found that there exists in Jackson a shortage of housing
affordable to residents of low or moderate income, including the elderly; that the
existence of such condition affects the health, safety and welfare of the residents
of the City of Jackson and retards their growth and economic and social
development; and that the elimination or improvement of such condition is a
matter of public purpose. (Ord. #2009 005, April 2009)
2-604. Meetings and officers. The place, date, and time of the holding
of regular meetings of the board if directors shall be set by the board and may
be changed from time to time, by resolution, without a requirement of an
amendment to these bylaws and without any requirement of further notice to
the directors. The regular meeting in April of each year shall constitute the
annual meeting of the board of directors.
Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the chairman
or any two (2) directors, by giving at least five (5) days written notice to each
director. Notice shall be deemed given when delivered to a director by hand or
by facsimile or similar means of transmission or then deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to a director at his or her address of
record as maintained by the secretary of the CRA.
It shall be the policy of the CRA to comply with all laws relating to
meetings of public bodies, to the extent applicable, including requirements of
public notice. Regular or special meetings, (other than special meetings called
by board members other than the chairman), may be canceled by the chairman,
without the necessity for public notice of such cancellation, if the chairman shall
determine that there is no business to come before such meeting.
All resolutions shall be in writing and shall be copied in a journal of the
proceedings of the board of directors of the redevelopment agency.
The chairman shall have the power to appoint such committees as the
chairman, in his or her discretion, may deem advisable; said committees shall
have the power to recommend a course of conduct to the board but shall have no
extraordinary powers to act.
The board shall meet, at least, quarterly at such time and place as the
board may fix by board resolution. Such meetings shall be open to the public.
Notices of such meetings shall be placed on the City of Jackson website at least
forty-eight hours (48) prior to such meetings. Special meetings upon notice may
be called from time to time by the chairman, or at the request of the majority of
the members of the board. A majority of the members of the board shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The board shall cause a
proper record to be kept of the proceedings. For this purpose the board shall
2-21
appoint a secretary who shall be a member of the board. The board shall also
appoint a treasurer who shall be a member of the board. The chairman and vice
chairman of the board shall be appointed by the governing body from among the
board membership to serve for a term of one (1) year or to the end of the term
of said chairman if less than one (1) year is remaining, with the right of
succession for one (1) additional term only at the option of the governing body.

board to file written reports, both periodically and final, on all individual
projects with the director of planning in a timely manner. (Ord. #2009 005,

Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-703. Creation of redevelopment trust fund. There is hereby
created, for the use and benefit of the agency, a redevelopment trust fund. Any
funds allocated and deposited to the redevelopment trust fund shall be used by
the agency for the financing or refinancing of any community development it

Nov. 2010)
Change 1, October 2, 2012 2-23
2-704. Depository account. The redevelopment trust fund may be
maintained at any bank or other financial institution having offices located
within the county as determined by the agency. No other agency moneys or
funds shall be placed into the redevelopment trust fund except as permitted by
the Act. (as added by Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-705. Annual funding of the redevelopment trust fund. The
annual funding of the redevelopment trust fund shall be in an amount not less
than the increment in the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the city
and/or county, or other taxing authority, derived from or held in connection with
the undertaking and carrying out of community development under the Act.
Such increment (the "Increment") shall be determined annually and shall be
that amount equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the difference between:
(1) The amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by each taxing
authority exclusive of any amount from any debt service millage, on taxable real
property contained within the geographic boundaries the plan area or any future
community development plan area duly approved and adopted as such pursuant
to the requirements of the Act; and
(2) The amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced
by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each taxing
authority, exclusive of debt service millage, upon the total of the assessed value
of the taxable real property in the plan area as shown by the most recent
assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by each
taxing authority prior to the effective date of the ordinance comprising this
chapter.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Act, each taxing authority shall, by
January 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2011, appropriate to the trust
fund for so long as any indebtedness pledging increment revenues to the
payment thereof is outstanding (but not to exceed thirty (30) years) a sum that
is no less than the increment accruing to such taxing authority. If the
redevelopment plan is amended or modified pursuant to the Act, each such
taxing authority shall make the annual appropriation for a period not to exceed
thirty (30) years after the effective date of the amendment of the redevelopment
plan. (as added by Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-706. Discretion to grant exemptions. Subject to the requirements
of the Act, the city and/or county shall have the power to exempt from the
requirements of § 2-705 any special district, other than the city and/or county,
that levies ad valorem taxes within the plan area, provided such grant of
exemption is otherwise lawful. (as added by Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-707. Term of redevelopment trust fund. The redevelopment trust
fund shall remain in existence for thirty (30) years after the date of the adoption
of the redevelopment trust fund; provided that if the redevelopment plan is
Change 1, October 2, 2012 2-24
amended in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the redevelopment trust
fund shall remain in existence for at least thirty (30) years after the effective
date of such modification or amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligation of the taxing authorities to fund the redevelopment trust fund
annually shall continue until all loans, advances, and indebtedness, if any, and
interest thereon, of the agency incurred as a result of redevelopment in the plan
area or other approved community redevelopment area have been paid. Upon
termination of the redevelopment trust fund, any remaining moneys in the
redevelopment trust fund shall be returned to each taxing authority which paid
the increment in the proportion that the amount of the payment of such taxing
authority bears to the total amount paid into the redevelopment trust fund by
all taxing authorities. (as added by Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-708. Bonds and notes--limited obligations. The revenue bonds and
notes of every issue under this chapter and the Act are payable solely out of
revenues pledged to and received by the agency and deposited to the
redevelopment trust fund. The lien created by such bonds or notes shall not
attach until the revenues referred to herein are deposited in the redevelopment
trust fund at the times, and to the extent that, such revenues accrue. The
holders of such bonds or notes have no right to require the imposition of any tax
or the establishment of any rate of taxation in order to obtain the amounts
necessary to pay and retire such bonds or notes. Revenue bonds issued under
the provisions of this chapter and the Act shall not be deemed to constitute a
debt, liability, or obligation of either the city or county, other local taxing
authority, or the State of Tennessee or any political subdivision thereof, nor
shall same constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the city, county, other
local taxing authority, or the State of Tennessee or any political subdivision
thereof, but shall be payable solely from the revenues provided therefor. All such
revenue bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that the
agency shall not be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from
revenues of the agency held for that purpose and that neither the faith and
credit nor the taxing power of the city, county, other local taxing authority, or
the State of Tennessee or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the
payment of the principal of, or the interest on, such bonds. (as added by
Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-709. Expenditures from redevelopment trust fund. Moneys in the
trust fund may be expended from time to time for the following purposes, when
directly related to financing or refinancing or redevelopment in the plan area or
other community redevelopment area pursuant to the redevelopment plan or
lawful amendments thereto:

the implementation of the redevelopment plan adopted by the agency or other
governing body.

premium for loans, advances, bonds, bond anticipation notes, and any other
form of indebtedness.
(6) All expenses incidental to or connected with the issuance, sale,
redemption, retirement, or purchase of any agency bonds, bond anticipation
notes, or other form of indebtedness, including funding of any reserve,

authorizing such bonds, notes, or other form of indebtedness.
(7) The development of affordable housing with the plan area. (as
added by Ord. #2010-016, Nov. 2010)
2-710. Use of surplus funds. On the last day of the fiscal year of the
agency, any money which remains in the trust fund after the payment of
expenses pursuant to the preceding section for such year shall be:
(1) Returned to each taxing authority which paid the increment in the
proportion that the amount of the payment of such taxing authority bears to the
total amount paid into the trust fund by all taxing authorities within the plan
area for that year;
(2) Used to reduce the amount of any indebtedness to which increment
revenues are pledged;
(3) Deposited into an escrow account for the purpose of later reducing
any indebtedness to which increment revenues are pledged; or

redevelopment plan which project will be completed within three (3) years from

audit of the trust fund each fiscal year and a report of such audit. Such report

indebtedness. The agency shall provide a copy of the report to each taxing

"City of Jackson Employees Retirement System." All transactions by said system
shall be in the name of the system. The system shall function as hereinafter
provided. All benefits payable to retired persons and their survivors from any
former plan shall continue unimpaired, and such benefits shall not be an
obligation or liability of this system. Any benefit payable to a retired member in
accordance with the provisions of this system shall not be payable during any
4-5
period of time he becomes or is an employee, notwithstanding anything in this
system to the contrary. (1995 Code, § 4-102)

pension board shall be the council of the city. A majority of the members of the
board shall constitute a quorum, and all action taken by the board shall be by
affirmative vote of the majority of all members of the board. The board shall
meet at least once in each quarter of each calendar year, and the board may
meet in special session upon call by any member of the board. Any two (2)
members of the board shall execute any certificate, statement, or written
direction on behalf of the board, and any person interested in the system shall
be entitled to rely upon such execution as being an action of the board. (1995
Code, § 4-103)
4-104. Duties and powers of the pension board. (1) The pension
board shall have complete control of the administration of the system, subject
to the provisions of this chapter with all powers necessary to enable it properly
to carry out its duties in that respect. Not in limitation, but in amplification of
the foregoing, the board shall have the power, not inconsistent with the
provisions of this system, to construe any provision of this system and to
determine all questions that may arise hereunder, including questions relating
to eligibility of employees to become members and the amount of benefit to
which any member, beneficiary, survivor or contingent annuitant may become
entitled hereunder, subject however, to requirements or limitations reserved to
the insurance carrier or trustee, in the group annuity contract or trust
agreement respectively, as the case may be.
(2) The board shall select the insurance carrier or bank, or both, as the
case may be, to administer the fund created by this system and to administer
the system in such other ways as the board may direct, and shall hereby be
authorized to execute a group annuity contract or trust agreement, or both, to
effect the purposes of this system.
(3) The decisions of the board upon all matters within the scope of its
authority shall be final. The board shall establish rules and procedures to be
followed by members, beneficiaries, survivors and contingent annuitants in
filing applications for benefits, in furnishing and verifying proofs necessary to
determine age, earnings, or in any other matters required to administer the
system.
(4) The board shall receive all applications for benefits. Upon receipt
by the board of such an application, it shall determine all facts which are
necessary to establish the right of the applicant to benefits under the provisions
of the system and the amount thereof as provided herein. Upon request, the
board will afford any applicant the right of hearing with respect to any findings
of fact or determination. The board, as it sees fit, shall prepare from time to time
information concerning the system and distribute such information to employees
4-6
and members. The board shall prepare and publish an annual financial report
showing all receipts, disbursements, assets and liabilities of the system. All
proceedings and records of the board shall be open for inspection by the public.
(5) To enable the board to perform its functions, the city shall supply
full and timely information to the board on all matters relating to the earnings
of members, their length of service, their retirement or other causes of
termination of employment, contributions by members, and other pertinent facts
as the board may require.
(6) The board shall certify to all interested parties the signatures of all
members of the board. Any person shall be entitled to rely on the last received
such certification of signatures until written notice to the contrary from the
board has been received.
(7) The board shall be empowered to employ the services of legal
counsel, investment consultants, actuarial consultants, and the services of
others which in the sole discretion of the board, may be necessary to maintain
a soundly designed, administered and financed pension system. The board shall
be empowered to pay from the fund all expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
board in the administration of the system during each fiscal year. Members of
the board shall serve without compensation as members of the board, but
members of the board shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred by
them in the performances of their duties.
(8) As soon as practicable after the effective date, the board shall
adopt such actuarial rates, values and other tables, and forms as are necessary
for the administration of the system. An annual valuation shall be ordered by
the board to determine the contingent assets, contingent liabilities and funding
requirements of the system. At least once in each five (5) year period, the board
shall cause an actuarial investigation to be made of the experience of the system
relating to the actuarial assumptions. The board shall adopt from time to time,
as it sees fit or as may be necessary, new actuarial rates, values and other tables
and forms necessary for the administration of the system.
(9) The board shall be entitled to rely upon all tables, valuations,
certificates and reports furnished by any consultant or actuary or insurance
company, as the case may be; all opinions given by any legal counsel selected or
approved by the board; and any advice of a qualified consultant. The board shall
be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by the board in
good faith in reliance upon the advice or opinion of any such consultant, actuary,
legal counsel, investment consultant, or insurance company, and all actions so
taken or suffered shall be conclusive upon each of them and upon all members
and other persons interested in the system.
(10) The board shall have no power in any way to modify, alter, add to
or subtract from any provision of this system.
(11) The board shall be authorized and empowered to do all things and
take all actions necessary to effect social security coverage for members of this
system, including those who voluntarily elected to become covered by social
4-7
security and to transfer their coverage from a former plan to this system, as
provided in § 4-119. The city shall hereby be authorized and empowered to
negotiate any agreement or modification of an existing agreement with the State
of Tennessee to accomplish such social security coverage. The city shall
determine the date as of which such coverage shall be effective, and the city
shall promptly execute any agreement or modifications of an existing agreement
which may be necessary to accomplish such social security coverage. The city
shall be authorized and empowered to pay from the funds of any of the former
plans to the Social Security Administration the amount of any retroactive social
security taxes as may be required by such agreement or agreements or
modifications of any existing agreements. (1995 Code, § 4-104)
4-105. Personal interest of members of pension board prohibited.
No member of the board shall have any interest direct or indirect in
commissions or fees paid to anyone for any services to the system, or in the
gains or profits of any investment made in the fund, except to the extent any
member of the board may be a member, survivor, or beneficiary of the system.
No member of the board shall receive, directly or indirectly, any pay or
emolument for his services. No member of the board shall, directly or indirectly,
for himself or as an agent, use in any manner the funds or deposits of the
system, except to make such payments therefrom as are authorized by the
board, nor shall any member of the board become an endorser or surety or in
any manner an obligor for monies loaned by or borrowed from the system. (1995
Code, § 4-105)
4-106. Members' contribution account. The members' contribution
account shall be the account to which all members' contributions, as provided
in this system, shall be credited. From this account shall be paid any refund of
contributions to each member terminating his service other than by retirement
or death; and at the time a member retires or dies, his account balance shall be
transferred to the retirement allowance account as defined in § 4-108.
Contributions by a member shall be deducted from his earnings for each payroll
period subsequent to his becoming a member and the amount so deducted shall
be credited to the member's individual account of the members' contribution
account. Contributions by members provided for in this system shall be made
notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any
member shall be reduced thereby. Every employee by his becoming a member
shall consent and agree to the payroll deductions made as provided in this
system; and payment of salaries or wages, less such deductions, shall be a full
and complete discharge of all claims for services rendered by such members
during the period covered by such payment. (1995 Code, § 4-106)
4-107. Coverage by Social Security Act. All members of this system
shall be covered by the Social Security Act. Any participant of a former plan who
4-8
desires to transfer his coverage from a former plan to this system must do so by
written notice of his election delivered to the board within one (1) year from the
effective date. Each participant of a former plan who elects to transfer his
coverage from a former plan to this system shall as a condition of transfer,
contribute social security taxes from the date that social security coverage is
made effective in addition to the contributions he shall make to this system as
provided in § 4-125.
In the case of a member of a former plan who voluntarily elects to transfer
his membership to this system in accordance with § 4-120, an amount equal to
the required taxes, if any, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act
payable by such member for any period of time that such coverage under the
Social Security Act is made retroactive, shall be deducted from amounts credited
to his individual account, if any, of the members' contribution account. (1995
Code, § 4-107)
4-108. Retirement allowance account. The retirement allowance
account shall be the account in which all employer contributions, all amounts
transferred from the members' contribution account, and all incomes from any
invested assets of any fund shall be accumulated. From this account shall be
paid the expenses of the board in administering the system, premiums on
account of any insurance or annuity benefits as may be required, death and
retirement benefits, to the extent such benefits are not provided by any
insurance carrier, and any other benefits payable after a member's retirement
or death. (1995 Code, § 4-108)
4-109. Correction of errors. If any change in records or error results
in any member, survivor, contingent annuitant, or beneficiary receiving from the
system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records
been correct or had the error not have been made, the board, upon discovery of
such error, shall correct the error by adjusting, as far as practicable, the
payments in such a manner that the benefits to which the member, survivor,
contingent annuitant, or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. If any
change in records or error results in any member or the employer contributing
to the fund more or less than should have been contributed had the records been
correct or had the error not been made, the board, upon discovery of such error,
shall correct the error by adjusting, as far as practicable, the contribution
payable to the member or the employer so that the total contributions paid will
equal the amount payable had the records been correct or had the error not been
made. (1995 Code, § 4-109)
4-110. Retirement benefits exempt from taxation, execution or
assignment. All retirement benefits and other benefits accrued or accruing to
any person under the provisions of this chapter, and the contributions by
members as well as the employer, and the other assets of the fund are hereby
4-9
exempted from any county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to
execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other process whatsoever, nor shall
any assignment thereof be enforceable in any court. (1995 Code, § 4-110)
4-111. False statements. Any person who shall knowingly make any
false statement, or shall falsify or permit to be falsified any record or records of
the system, in any attempt to defraud the system shall forfeit all rights and
benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled. (1995 Code, § 4-111)
4-112. Legally incompetent. If any member, retired member, survivor,
beneficiary or contingent annuitant is a minor, or is in the judgment of the
board otherwise legally incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid
receipt for any payment due him hereunder, the board may, unless and until
claim shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or conservator of such
person, direct that such payment or any part thereof be made to such person's
spouse, child, parent, brother, or sister, deemed by the board to have incurred
expenses for or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person. Any
payment so made shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the system
for such payment. (1995 Code, § 4-112)
4-113. Amendment or repeal. An amendment or repeal of any
provision of this system shall be made only following an actuarial determination
of its effect on the soundness of the system's design as well as its effect on the
cost of the system, and disclosure of such information to all interested persons,
and following a determination by the board that any such amendment or repeal
meets all the requirements of Tennessee statutes relating to the actuarial
soundness of the program and following a determination by the board that any
such amendment or repeal meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or of any federal law of a similar
nature relating to qualified pension plans. No amendment or repeal of a
provision of this system shall affect in any way the benefits then being paid to
members, survivors, contingent annuitants or beneficiaries or benefits based on
service completed prior to the date of such amendment or repeal, except as
provided in § 4-114; provided however, that in determining such accrued
benefits payable to members, average earnings shall be determined as of the
date of the amendment or repeal, as the case may be. (1995 Code, § 4-113)
4-114. Repeal of entire system. (1) In event of repeal of this system
in its entirety, including amendments thereto, the board shall prepare a list of
all members, retired members, survivors, contingent annuitants and
beneficiaries, showing for each, as of the date of such repeal, the following:
(a) For each retired member, survivor, beneficiary or contingent
annuitant receiving benefits, the amount and terms of payment of such
benefits.
4-10
(b) For each member entitled to a deferred benefit as provided
in § 4-134(1), the amount and terms of payment of such benefit.
(c) The benefits shown on the above list will then be separated
into "priority classes" as follows:
"Priority Class A." Benefits for members who have reached
their sixty-fifth (65th) birthdays, benefits for retired members who
have reached their sixty-fifth (65th) birthdays, and benefits for
survivors, beneficiaries and contingent annuitants of all deceased
members or retired members.
"Priority Class B." Benefits for members, retired members
who are receiving benefits, terminated members entitled to a
deferred benefit as provided in § 4-134(1); provided that they have
reached their fifty-fifth (55th) but not their sixty-fifth (65th)
birthdays and have completed twenty (20) years of credited service.
"Priority Class C." Benefits to all other members,
terminated members and retired members.
(2) The board will then arrange for the liquidation of all assets held in
the fund maintained in connection with the system and prepare a statement of
the liquidated value of such assets. The board will then arrange for the
application of the assets of the fund to purchase annuities from an insurance
company or companies, to provide in full, if such assets are sufficient to do so,
the benefits in Priority Class A. If such assets are not sufficient to purchase one
hundred percent (100%) of benefits in Priority Class A, they shall be applied in
full to purchase such uniform percentage as can be purchased. If the assets of
the fund are more than sufficient to purchase one hundred percent (100%) of the
benefits in Priority Class A, the remainder shall be applied in the same manner
to purchase all or a uniform percentage of benefits in Priority Class B. If the
remaining assets are more than sufficient to purchase one hundred percent
(100%) of the benefits in Priority Class B, the remainder shall be applied in the
same manner to purchase all or a uniform percentage of benefits in Priority
Class C. If the remaining assets are more than sufficient to purchase one
hundred percent (100%) of the benefits in Priority Class C, the remainder shall
revert to the city. Upon completion of the steps specified above, this system shall
be considered repealed, and no member, retired member, survivor, beneficiary
or contingent annuitant shall have any further right or claim to benefits under
this system. (1995 Code, § 4-114)
4-115. Internal Revenue Service requirements; State of Tennessee
requirements. It is a stated intention that this plan be a qualified plan
according to Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or
of any similar, successor law. It is also the intention that this system shall
conform to all laws of the State of Tennessee which relate to actuarial
requirements of public employee plans for cities in the State of Tennessee.
4-11
Accordingly, any such requirement of any federal law or law of the State of
Tennessee shall be deemed to be included as a part of this system and the
system shall be administered by the board in such manner that the system
conforms to all legal requirements referred to in this section. (1995 Code,
§ 4-115)
4-116. Termination of system by default. In the event the city fails
for four (4) consecutive fiscal years to contribute in accordance with the
provisions of § 4-106, the system shall automatically terminate and the
provisions of § 4-114 shall apply in the same manner as though the system in
its entirety has been repealed. (1995 Code, § 4-116)
4-117. Right of employment. Nothing contained in this system shall
be deemed to give any member or employee the right to be retained in the
employment of the city or to interfere with the right of the city to discharge any
member or employee, regardless of the effect which such discharge would have
upon him as a member. (1995 Code, § 4-117)
4-118. Certain employees to become members of Tennessee
Consolidated Retirement System; transfers into state plan. (1) Each and
every person becoming a full-time regular employee of the City of Jackson on
and after May 1, 1974, shall, as a condition of employment, become a member
of the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System as of his date of employment,
subject to such terms and conditions, rules and regulations, deductions and
assessments, as may be in effect from time to time, applicable to such
retirement system. Employees who are presently a member of the "City of
Jackson Employees Retirement System," adopted December 14, 1965, may
remain a member of such retirement system or may elect to transfer their
membership to the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System. Such election,
however, to be made on or before the 1st day of May, 1974, which such election
when once made shall be final. Election to transfer membership to the
Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System may be made quarterly under such
terms and conditions as may conform with the provisions of the Tennessee
Consolidated Retirement System.
(2) Present employees who have remained members of a "former plan"
as defined in § 4-101(4), shall have the same right of transfer to the Tennessee
Consolidated Retirement System, as set forth above for present members of the
"City of Jackson Employees Retirement System," subject to the identical terms
and conditions, more fully set forth above.
(3) Any present full-time regular employee of the City of Jackson not
now covered by any retirement plan may elect to become a member of the
Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System in the same manner and under the
same conditions as set forth above for present members of the other existing city
retirement plans. (1995 Code, § 4-118)
4-12
4-119. Eligibility and participation of a member of a former plan
who transfers his membership to this system. Each employee who is a
participant in a former plan and who voluntarily elects in writing to transfer his
membership to this system, in accordance with the provisions of this system,
shall upon becoming a member of this system, cease to be a member or a
participant in a former plan, and shall thereafter have no rights to any benefit
provided by any former plan and all contributions made by him which stand to
his credit in a former plan as of the date he transfers to this system shall be
transferred to this system. All such amounts transferred shall be credited to his
individual account in the members' contribution account.
Any employee on the effective date who desires to transfer to this system
shall deliver within one (1) year from the effective date written notice to the
board of his election to become a member of this system. He shall become a
member as of the effective date and his employee contributions to the system
shall be due and payable from the effective date. In the case of an employee on
authorized leave of absence on the effective date, such written notice must be
delivered to the board within ninety (90) days of his return to active
employment. If an employee does not deliver such written notice within the time
limits prescribed in this section, he shall be deemed to have refused membership
in this system, and he shall forfeit his right to any credit for prior service if he
subsequently delivers such written notice, notwithstanding anything in this
system to the contrary. He may subsequently deliver such written notice to the
board, but he shall not have any right to credit for prior service and he shall pay
into the fund all contributions he would have made from the effective date to the
date such written notice is delivered by him to the board. (1995 Code, § 4-119)
4-120. Eligibility and participation of employees on the effective
date who are not members of a former plan. Each employee on the
effective date who is not then a member of any former plan shall be eligible to
become a member of this system on the effective date. (1995 Code § 4-120)
4-121. Termination of membership in the system. If a member
terminates his membership in this system, be shall thereafter forfeit all rights
to any benefit or benefits provided by this system arising from service completed
prior to the date his membership is terminated, except as otherwise provided in
this system. The membership of any member shall terminate upon:
(1) Withdrawal of his contributions at, or any time after, termination
of employment, regardless of his length of credited service;
(2) Termination of employment, unless at such termination of
employment he has completed twenty (20) years of credited service and he does
not withdraw his contributions;
(3) Retirement, except disability retirement followed by reemployment
as an employee subject to § 4-135, or early retirement, if a monthly deferred
4-13
early retirement benefit was elected, followed by reemployment as an employee
subject to § 4-134;
(4) Death;
(5) Teachers of the Jackson School Department now members of the
city retirement system, or members of a former plan as defined in § 4-101(4)(a)
thereof, who are eligible for membership in the Tennessee Consolidated
Retirement System may transfer from the city retirement system, or a former
plan, to the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System as a Class A member,
provided such teachers indicate in writing to the superintendent of the city
school system on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of December, 1973, that
they desire to effect such transfer. Such decision when made shall be
irrevocable. Any teacher not electing to transfer shall remain a member of the
plan or system of which he or she is now a member. Transfers requested after
the thirty-first (31st) day of December, 1973, will not be considered. (1995 Code,
§ 4-121)
4-122. Designation of beneficiary; contingent annuitant. A
member may designate any person as beneficiary or contingent annuitant, as
the case may be, to receive benefits provided by this system and payable upon
the death of the member. A change in such designation may be made at any
time by the member, subject to the provisions of § 4-143. Such designation or
change in designation shall be submitted in writing to the board in such form
and manner as the board may prescribe. No designation of beneficiary or
contingent annuitant shall be effective unless and until it has been received by
the board prior to the date of death of the member. Upon any change in
designation, the rights of each previously designated beneficiary or contingent
annuitant to receive any benefits payable from this system upon the death of a
member shall cease. (1995 Code, § 4-122)
4-123. Prior service certificates. As soon as practicable after the
effective date, the board shall determine the prior service of each member who
was an employee on the effective date and shall issue to such member a
certificate of his prior service. If the board discovers that the prior service
recorded on a certificate is incorrect, a corrected certificate superseding any
certificate previously issued shall be issued promptly. Copies of such certificates
shall become a part of the permanent records maintained by the board for the
purpose of determining benefits payable to members or to their beneficiaries or
contingent annuitants. In establishing such records, the board may require, in
its discretion, members, beneficiaries, contingent annuitants and other persons
to submit affidavits as to any information and data which affect benefits payable
to members or their beneficiaries or contingent annuitants. When a member
terminates his membership as provided in § 4-121, his certificate of prior service
shall become void. (1995 Code, § 4-123)
4-14
4-124. Members entitled to benefits from the State of Tennessee
Teachers' Retirement System. Notwithstanding any provision in the plan
to the contrary, any monthly retirement benefit due a member shall be
increased by an amount of "supplemental benefit" which shall be determined so
that it has the same actuarial value as the amounts due the City of Jackson,
Tennessee Retirement System from the State of Tennessee Teachers'
Retirement System on account of the time that a member is covered by said
state system other than the time during which he is covered by this system.
(1995 Code, § 4-124)
4-125. Employee contributions. Each member shall contribute by
payroll deduction two percent (2%) of his base earnings plus six percent (6%) of
his excess earnings. Contributions shall commence on the effective date, or on
the first day of the month coinciding with or next following completion of six (6)
months of credited service, whichever is later. For administrative convenience,
the board in its sole discretion may determine the rate at which base earnings
and excess earnings shall apply to each payroll period for purposes of raking
deductions.
Each member's contributions shall be recorded by the city to an individual
account in the name of the member. The city shall keep the board informed as
to the status of each member's individual account, as the board shall request.
(1995 Code, § 4-125)
4-126. Employer contributions. The cost of the system not provided
for by the contributions of members will be borne by contributions made by the
city. Contributions by the city shall be made irrevocably and shall be used solely
for the benefits of members, retired members, beneficiaries, and contingent
annuitants. Contributions made by the city to the system for the benefit of all
members shall not be allocated to each member. The amount of annual
contributions made by the city each year, commencing in 1966, shall be subject
to a minimum percent of payroll of members based on a normal contribution
plus five percent (5%) of unfunded past service liabilities; such minimum shall
be based on the results of the most recent actuarial valuation made to determine
the extent of unfunded liabilities and normal contribution rates.
The amount of normal contribution and unfunded past service liabilities
shall be determined by an insurance company or by a qualified actuary on the
basis of reasonable and conservative assumptions and on the basis of accepted
actuarial methods approved by the board. (1995 Code, § 4-126)
4-127. Medium of financing the system. Investment of all
contributions made toward the cost of the system and payment of benefits
pursuant to this system will be accomplished by a fund held and administered
pursuant to a trust agreement with a national bank or a group annuity contract
with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York, or
4-15
both, as executed and as may be amended from time to time. Any such executed
instrument shall constitute a part of this system. (1995 Code, § 4-127)
4-128. Benefits, conditions. Before any benefit provided for in §§ 4-128
through 4-144 can be payable, all conditions applicable to the payment of the
benefit must be met, application for the benefit must be presented to the board
in such form and manner as the board shall prescribe, and payment of the
benefit must be authorized by the board. If any monthly retirement income
provided for in §§ 4-128 through 4-142 is less than twenty dollars ($20.00) per
month, the board in its discretion may authorize the payment of the actuarial
equivalent value of such benefit in one lump sum or in such other manner as the
board may determine. Notwithstanding any provision in this system to the
contrary:
(1) Any condition applicable to the payment of any benefit in this
system included in any insurance contract that is a part of this system, shall be
a requirement of this system, and
(2) Any person eligible to receive any benefit from a former plan, shall
not be eligible to receive any benefit from this system. (1995 Code, § 4-128)
4-129. Normal retirement conditions. Each member shall be eligible
to retire on his normal retirement date and to receive a benefit as provided in
§ 4-130. (1995 Code, § 4-129)
4-130. Normal retirement benefit. A member shall, upon retirement
on his normal retirement date, receive a monthly normal retirement benefit
which shall be payable on his normal retirement date and on the first day of
each month thereafter during his lifetime, computed as of his normal retirement
date as one-twelfth (1/12th) of the difference, if any of (1) minus (2), as follows:
(1) Fifty percent (50%) of average earnings;
(2) Computed amount of primary social security.
Provided, however, the amount so determined shall be reduced four
percent (4%) for each year, if any, that credited service is less than twenty-five
(25) years.
The benefit so computed, however, shall not be less than a monthly
benefit which has a commuted value actuarially equivalent to twice the total
amount that the member has contributed to the system. The "computed amount
of primary social security," as used in this system, shall be determined by the
board in accordance with the method by which the primary insurance amount
is determined in accordance with the social security law as such law existed on
the date of termination, except that the primary insurance amount shall be
based on the amount of his average earnings on the date of termination. Should
a retired member prove to the satisfaction of the board that the actual amount
of his monthly primary social security benefit, not reduced by reason of any
earnings, is less than the computed amount, the board shall thereupon adjust
4-16
his retirement benefit provided under this section, or option elected, as the case
may be, according to the actual rather than the computed amount of his primary
social security benefit. (1995 Code, § 4-130)
4-131. Delayed retirement, conditions. A member may remain in the
active employment of the city beyond his normal retirement date, if requested
in writing to do so by the head of his department and with the written approval
of the board and shall be eligible to retire on his delayed retirement date which
shall be the first day of any month following the effective date and his normal
retirement date, and to receive a benefit as provided in § 4-132. (1995 Code,
§ 4-131)
4-132. Delayed retirement benefit. A member shall, upon retirement
on his delayed retirement date, receive a monthly delayed retirement benefit,
which shall be payable on his delayed retirement date and on the first day of
each month thereafter during his lifetime, computed in the same manner set
forth in § 4-130, except that such computation shall be made as of his delayed
retirement date. (1995 Code, § 4-132)
4-133. Early retirement, conditions. A member who has reached his
fifty-fifth (55th) birthday and has completed twenty (20) years of credited
service, or who has reached age sixty-two (62), shall be eligible to retire on his
early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month thereafter but
prior to his normal retirement date and to receive a benefit as provided in
§ 4-134. (1995 Code, § 4-133)
4-134. Early retirement benefit. A member shall, upon retirement on
his early retirement date, receive either (1) or (2) as he may elect in writing to
the board, as follows:
(1) A monthly deferred early retirement benefit, which shall be
payable on his normal retirement date, provided he is then living, and on the
first day of each month thereafter during his lifetime, computed in the same
manner set forth in § 4-132, except that such computation shall be made as of
his early retirement date and the amount to be reduced by multiplying by the
ratio of his credited service at time of termination to the amount of credited
service he would have if he continued as an employee until his normal
retirement date; provided however, that if the date of death of such member
occurs after his termination of employment and prior to his normal retirement
date, his beneficiary shall receive a refund of the contributions standing to the
credit of such deceased member; or
(2) An immediate monthly early retirement benefit, which shall be
payable on his early retirement date and on the first day of each month
thereafter during his lifetime, the amount of which shall be actuarially
equivalent in value to the benefit provided in subsection (1) of this section.
4-17
If a member who has elected a monthly deferred early retirement benefit
as provided in subsection (1) of this section is re-employed by the city, his
credited service shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, but shall not
include any time during which he was not an employee. (1995 Code, § 4-134)
4-135. Definition of disability, requirements. Disability shall mean
a physical or mental condition of a member which has persisted for six (6)
continuous months, which is likely to be permanent, and which has rendered
him incapable of performing work which would provide income at a rate of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of his regular rate of earnings at the time
such disability began. Loss by severance of both hands at or above the wrists,
or both feet at or above the ankles, or one hand above the wrist and one foot at
or above the ankle, or the complete irrecoverable loss of the sight of both eyes,
shall conclusively determine disability, notwithstanding the extent of the income
of the member after the date of such loss.
Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, disability
as defined in this section shall not include a physical or mental condition which
results directly or indirectly from:
(1) Injuries intentionally self-inflicted;
(2) Injury or disease resulting from military service; or
(3) Injury or disease suffered or contracted prior to the date last hired
as an employee by the city.
The board shall have the exclusive authority to determine the existence
of disability. The board, in its sole discretion, may secure such medical and other
evidence as it deems necessary and appropriate. Once each calendar year, the
board may require any retired member who is receiving a disability benefit and
who has not reached his normal retirement date to undergo a medical
examination by a physician or physicians designated by the board; and such
examination shall be made at the place of residence of such retired member or
any other place the board designates. If the board determines from such medical
examination or any other evidence that the disability of the retired member has
ceased, his disability benefit shall be discontinued as of the date of such
determination. If a retired member refuses to submit to such medical
examination, his disability benefit shall be discontinued until he shall actually
undergo such medical examination; and if he fails to undergo such medical
examination for one (1) year from the date the board requires such medical
examination, his disability benefit shall be discontinued permanently. Prior to
July 1 in each year, each retired member who receives a disability benefit in the
preceding calendar year and who has not reached his normal retirement date
shall submit proof satisfactory to the board of the amount of his income earned
in such preceding calendar year and derived from performing work. If the board
determines that such income is twenty-five percent (25%) or more of his regular
rate of annual earnings at the time such disability began, his disability benefit
shall be discontinued as of the date of such determination; provided however,
4-18
that if the retired member reapplies for disability benefits and the board
determines that disability exists, payment of his disability benefit shall resume
as of the date of such determination. If a retired member refuses or fails to
submit such proof to the board prior to July 1, in each calendar year, his
disability benefit shall be discontinued after such date and until he actually
submits such proof; and if he fails to submit such proof within one (1) year of
such date, his disability benefit shall be discontinued permanently. If the
disability benefit of a retired member is discontinued prior to his normal
retirement date and he is re-employed by the city within six (6) months
following the date his disability ceases, his credited service shall not be deemed
to have been interrupted, but shall not include any time during which he was
not an employee. (1995 Code, § 4-135)
4-136. Disability not in line of duty, conditions. A member who is
an employee, who has completed fifteen (15) years of credited service and who
has become disabled as defined in § 4-135 shall be eligible to retire from the
active employment of the city on his disability retirement date, which shall be
the first day of the month following the determination by the board that he is
disabled, and to receive a disability benefit as provided in § 4-138. (1995 Code,
§ 4-136)
4-137. Disability in line of duty, conditions. A member or an
employee hired after April 6, 1965, and who becomes disabled, as defined in
§ 4-135, as a direct result of any act occurring or thing done which, as
determined in the discretion of the board, was required of him in the
performance of his duty as an employee, shall be eligible to retire from the active
employment of the city on his disability retirement date, which shall be the first
day of the month following the determination by the board that he is disabled,
and to receive a disability benefit as provided in § 4-138. (1995 Code, § 4-137)
4-138. Disability benefit. A member who has become disabled, shall
receive a monthly disability retirement benefit, which shall be payable on his
disability retirement date, and on the first day of each month thereafter during
the period of his disability and during his lifetime until he reaches his otherwise
normal retirement date. Such disability retirement benefit shall be determined
as:
A monthly benefit equal to one-twelfth (1/12th) of the difference
between (1) fifty percent (50%) of average earnings determined as of his
disability retirement date and (2) a computed amount of primary social
security, provided however, that the amount of monthly benefit shall not
be less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
If a disabled member remains disabled, upon attaining his otherwise
normal retirement date, he shall thereafter be entitled to receive a monthly
4-19
retirement benefit which shall be payable on his normal retirement date and on
the first day of each month thereafter during his lifetime which shall be
determined in accordance with § 4-130, except that his credited service shall
include the period of time during which he received a disability retirement
benefit.
A member who is eligible to receive a disability benefit shall submit proof
satisfactory to the board that he has filed with the Social Security
Administration an application for disability benefits in accordance with the
provisions of the Social Security Act. The board may require from time to time
a member who is eligible to receive a disability benefit in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (2) of this section to file an application for disability
benefits with the Social Security Administration. If such member fails or refuses
to file such application, the board shall determine the amount of his computed
primary social security. (1995 Code, § 4-138)
4-139. Death benefits before retirement. If the date of death of a
member who was in the active employment of the city on such date, occurs prior
to the commencement of any benefits provided by this system, but after (1) the
first day of the month following his fifty-fifth (55th) birthday and his completion
of twenty (20) years of service or after (2) the first day of the month following his
sixty-second (62nd) birthday, his then living beneficiary shall receive a monthly
survivor benefit, which shall be payable on the first day of the month following
the date of death of the member and during the lifetime of such beneficiary.
Such monthly survivor benefit shall be computed as though the member had
retired on the day before his date of death and had elected Option A as provided
in § 4-144; provided however, that if no beneficiary is living on the date of death
of the member, a refund of his contributions shall be payable to his estate. In
lieu of all other benefits payable to a beneficiary upon the death of a member,
the beneficiary may elect to receive a lump sum payment of the member's
contributions standing to the credit of the deceased member.
If the date of death of a member occurs prior to the commencement of any
benefits provided by this system and prior to the first day of the month following
his fifty-fifth (55th) birthday and his completion of twenty (20) years of credited
service, or prior to the first day of the month following his sixty-second (62nd)
birthday if he has completed less than twenty (20) years of credited service, his
beneficiary shall receive a lump sum payment of the member's contributions
standing to the credit of the deceased member. (1995 Code, § 4-139)
4-140. Death benefits after retirement. No death benefit shall be
payable in the case of a retired member whose date of death occurs after
retirement, unless an optional form of benefit pursuant to §§ 4-143 through
4-144 which specifically provides for a death benefit is in effect at the time
retirement benefits commence. (1995 Code, § 4-140)
4-20
4-141. Termination of employment before completing twenty (20)
years of credited service. Any member who has completed less than twenty
(20) years of credited service at the time of his termination of employment shall
receive, in lieu of all other benefits he is eligible to receive, a refund of the
member's contributions standing to his credit. (1995 Code, § 4-141)
4-142. Termination of employment after completing twenty (20)
years of credited service. A member who has completed at least twenty (20)
years of credited service at the time of his termination of employment may elect
to receive, in lieu of all other benefits he is entitled to receive, either (1) or (2),
as follows:
(1) A refund of the members' contributions standing to his credit; or
(2) A monthly deferred vested retirement benefit, which shall be
payable on his normal retirement date, provided, he is then living and on the
first day of each month thereafter during his lifetime, computed in the same
manner set forth in § 4-134(1).
If a member who has elected a monthly deferred vested retirement benefit
as provided in subparagraph (2) of this section is re-employed by the city, his
credited service shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, but shall not
include any time during which he was not an employee. (1995 Code, § 4-142)
4-143. Optional retirement benefits. A member entitled to a
retirement benefit, other than the disability benefit as provided in § 4-138, shall
be deemed to have elected Option D provided in § 4-144 unless he revokes such
election in writing delivered to the board, but he may elect at any time prior to
his retirement date to have a retirement benefit payable under any one of the
other options set forth in § 4-144 in lieu of all the benefits he may otherwise be
entitled to receive. A member may revoke his election of an option and he may
make a new election at any time prior to retirement; but, notwithstanding the
foregoing, election of any option shall be subject to any requirements of the
insurance carrier, if any, and shall be made by the member in writing and in
such form and manner as the board may prescribe. The benefit shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of the option elected. The beneficiary or contingent
annuitant last designated by the member prior to the date he delivers written
application for an option to the board shall be the beneficiary or contingent
annuitant, as the case may be, to receive any benefits payable after his death.
The election of Option A or Option B by a member shall be null and void if the
member or his contingent annuitant, as the case may be, dies before benefits
commence. (1995 Code, § 4-143)
4-144. Description of options. The amount of any optional retirement
benefit set forth in this section shall be based on option rates adopted from time
to time by the board or as prescribed in the contract with the insurance carrier,
and shall be actuarially equivalent in value to the amount of benefit that would
4-21
otherwise be payable from this system to a retired member; provided however,
that an optional retirement benefit in lieu of the delayed retirement benefit as
provided in § 4-132 shall not be less than if based on the option rate that would
have been applicable had retirement occurred at his normal retirement date.
Option A, Joint and Survivor Option: A decreased retirement benefit
payable to the retired member for life which shall continue after his death to the
surviving contingent annuitant for life in the same amount as that payable to
the retired member.
Option B, Modified Joint and Survivor Option: A decreased retirement
benefit payable to the retired member for life which shall continue after his
death to the survivor contingent annuitant for life in the amount of fifty percent
(50%) of the amount that was payable to the retired member.
Option C, Social Security Option: An increased retirement benefit
payable to the retired member during his lifetime until his normal retirement
date and a reduced retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have
a more level retirement income when such reduced retirement benefit is added
to his primary insurance amount payable under the Social Security Act. The
optional benefit shall be based on the retired members estimated primary
insurance amount payable under the Social Security Act as such exists on his
early retirement date.
Option D, 120 Payments Certain and Life Option: A decreased retirement
benefit payable for life with the first one hundred twenty (120) payments
guaranteed. Any guaranteed payments due after the death of the retired
member shall be payable to his beneficiary. (1995 Code, § 4-144)

4-206. Standards authorized. The standards adopted under this
program are the applicable standards developed and promulgated under section
VI (6) of the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1972 or which
may, in the future, be developed and promulgated. Additional standards may be

(1) The application for a variance shall be prepared in writing and
shall contain:
(a) A specification of the standard or portion thereof from which
the variance is sought.
(b) A detailed statement of the reason(s) why the employer is
unable to comply with the standard supported by representations by
qualified personnel having first-hand knowledge of the facts represented.

what steps have or will be taken (with dates specified) to come into
compliance with the standard.
(e) A certification that the employer has informed employees,
their authorized representative(s), and/or interested parties by giving
them a copy of the request, posting a statement summarizing the
application (to include the location of a copy available for examination) at
1All appendices to this program are located in Appendix B of this
municipal code.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-29
the places where employee notices are normally posted and by other

informed of their right to petition the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development for a hearing.
(2) The application for a variance should be sent to the Commissioner
of Labor and Workforce Development by registered or certified mail.
(3) The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development will
review the application for a variance and may deny the request or issue an order
granting the variance. An order granting a variance shall be issued only if it has
been established that:
(a) The employer
(i) Is unable to comply with the standard by the effective
date because of unavailability of professional or technical
personnel or materials and equipment required or necessary
construction or alteration of facilities or technology.
(ii) Has taken all available steps to safeguard employees
against the hazard(s) covered by the standard.
(iii) Has an effective program for coming into compliance
with the standard as quickly as possible.
(b) The employee is engaged in an experimental program as
described in subsection (b), section 13 of the act.
(4) A variance may be granted for a period of no longer than is
required to achieve compliance or one (1) year, whichever is shorter.
(5) Upon receipt of an application for an order granting a variance, the
commissioner to whom such application is addressed may issue an interim order
granting such a variance for the purpose of permitting time for an orderly
consideration of such application. No such interim order may be effective for
longer than one hundred eighty (180) days.
(6) The order or interim order granting a variance shall be posted at
the worksite and employees notified of such order by the same means used to
inform them of the application for said variance (see subsection (1)(e) of this
section). (1995 Code, § 4-207, as replaced by Ord. #2015-012, Aug. 2015)
4-208. Recordkeeping and reporting. (1) Recording and reporting
of all occupational accident, injuries, and illnesses shall be in accordance with
instructions and on forms prescribed in the booklet, RECORDKEEPING
REQUIREMENTS UNDERTHE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
ACT OF 1970 (Revised 2003) or as may be prescribed by the Tennessee
Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-30
(2) The position responsible for recordkeeping is shown on the Safety
and Health Organizational Chart, Appendix V to this plan.1
(3) Details of how reports of occupational accidents, injuries, and
illnesses will reach the recordkeeper are specified by Accident Reporting
Procedures, Appendix V to this plan.1 (1995 Code, § 4-208, as replaced by Ord.

4-209. Employee complaint procedure. If any employee feels that he
is assigned to work in conditions which might affect his health, safety, or
general welfare at the present time or at any time in the future, he should
report the condition to the officer.
(1) The complaint should be in the form of a letter and give details on
the condition(s) and how the employee believes it affects or will affect his health,
safety, or general welfare. The employee should sign the letter but need not do
so if he wishes to remain anonymous (see § 4-201(8) of this plan).
(2) Upon receipt of the complaint letter, the officer will evaluate the
condition(s) and institute any corrective action, if warranted. Within ten (10)
working days following the receipt of the complaint, the officer will answer the
complaint in writing stating whether or not the complaint is deemed to be valid
and if no, why not, what action has been or will be taken to correct or abate the
condition(s), and giving a designated time period for correction or abatement.
Answers to anonymous complaints will be posted upon bulletin boards or other
places of common passage where the anonymous complaint may be reasonably
expected to be seen by the complainant for a period of tbree (3) working days.
(3) If the complainant finds the reply not satisfactory because it was
held to be invalid, the corrective action is felt to be insufficient, or the time
period for correction is felt to be too long, he may forward a letter to the chief
executive officer or to the governing body explaining the condition(s) cited in his
original complaint and why he believes the answer to be inappropriate or
insufficient.
(4) The chief executive officer or a representative of the governing body
will evaluate the complaint and will begin to take action to correct or abate the
condition(s) through arbitration or administrative sanctions or may find the
complaint to be invalid. An answer will be sent to the complainant within ten
(10) working days following receipt of the complaint or the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the governing body following receipt of the complaint
explaining decisions made and action taken or to be taken.
(5) After the above steps have been followed and the complainant is
still not satisfied with the results, he may then file a complaint with the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development. Any complaint filed with
1All appendices to this program are located in Appendix B of this
municipal code.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-31
the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development in such cases shall
include copies of all related correspondence with the officer and the chief
executive officer or the representative of the governing body.
(6) Copies of all complaint and answers thereto will be filed by the
officer who shall make them available to the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development or his designated representative upon request. (1995
Code, § 4-209, as replaced by Ord. #2015-012, Aug. 2015)
4-210. Education and training. (1) Officer and/or compliance
inspector(s):
(a) Arrangements will be made for the officer and/or compliance
inspector(s) to attend training seminars, workshops, etc., conducted by
the State of Tennessee or other agencies.
(b) Reference materials, manuals, equipment, etc., deemed
necessary for use in conducting compliance inspections, conducting local
training, wiring technical reports, and informing officials, supervisors,
and employees of the existence of safety and health hazards will be
furnished.
(2) All Employees (including managers and supervisory personnel):
A suitable safety and health training program for employees will be
established. This program will, as a minimum:
(a) Instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of
hazards or unsafe conditions and of standards and regulations applicable
to the employees work environment to control or eliminate any hazards,
unsafe conditions, or other exposures to occupational illness or injury
(such as falls, electrocution, crushing injuries (e.g., trench cave-ins), and
being struck by material or equipment).
(b) Instruct employees who are required to handle poisons,
acids, caustics, explosives, and other harmful or dangerous substances
(including carbon monoxide and chlorine) in the safe handling and use of
such items and make them aware of the potential hazards, proper
handling procedures, personal protective measures, personal hygiene,
etc., which may be required.
(c) Instruct employees who may be exposed to environments
where harmful plants or animals are present of the hazards of the
environment, how to best avoid injury or exposure, and the first aid
procedures to be followed in the event of injury or exposure.
(d) Instruct employees required to handle or use flammable
liquids, gases, or toxic materials in their safe handling and use and make
employees aware of specific requirements contained in subparts H and M
and other applicable subparts of TOSHAct standards (1910 and/or 1926).
(e) Instruct employees on hazards and dangers of confined or
enclosed spaces.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-32
(i) Confined or enclosed space means space having a
limited means of egress and which is subject to the accumulation
of toxic or flammable contaminants or has an oxygen deficient
atmosphere. Confined or enclosed spaces include, but are not
limited to, storage tanks, boilers, ventilation or exhaust ducts,
sewers, underground utility accesses, tunnels, pipelines, and open
top spaces more than four feet (4') in depth such as pits, tubs,
vaults, and vessels.
(ii) Employees will be given general instruction on
hazards involved, precautions to be taken, and on use of personal
protective and emergency equipment required. They shall also be
instructed on all specific standards or regulations that apply to
work in dangerous or potentially dangerous areas.
(iii) The immediate supervisor of any employee who must
perform work in a confined or enclosed space shall be responsible
for instructing employees on danger of hazards which may be
present, precautions to be taken, and use of personal protective
and emergency equipment, immediately prior to their entry into
such an area and shall require use of appropriate personal
protective equipment. (1995 Code, § 4-210, as replaced by Ord.
#2015-012, Aug. 2015)
4-211. General inspection procedures. It is the intention of the
governing body and responsible officials to have an occupational safety and
health program that will insure the welfare of employees. In order to be aware
of hazards, periodic inspections must be performed. These inspections will
enable the finding of hazards or unsafe conditions or operations that will need
correction in order to maintain safe and healthful worksites. Inspections made
on a pre-designated basis may not yield the desired results. Inspections will be
conducted, therefore, on a random basis at intervals not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days.
(1) In order to carry out the purposes of this program, the director
and/or compliance inspector(s), if appointed, is authorized:
(a) To enter at any reasonable time, any establishment, facility,
or worksite where work is being performed by an employee when such
establishment, facility, or worksite is under the jurisdiction of the
employer and;
(b) To inspect and investigate during regular working hours and
at other reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable
manner, any such place of employment and all pertinent conditions,
processes, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, and
materials therein, and to question privately any supervisor, operator,
agent, or employee working therein.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-33
(2) If an imminent danger situation is found, alleged, or otherwise
brought to the attention of the officer or inspector during a routine inspection,
he shall immediately inspect the imminent danger situation in accordance with
§ 4-212 of this plan before inspecting the remaining portions of the
establishment, facility, or worksite.
(3) An administrative representative of the employer and a
representative authorized by the employees shall be given an opportunity to
consult with and/or to accompany the officer or inspector during the physical
inspection of any worksite for the purpose of aiding such inspection.
(4) The right of accompaniment may be denied any person whose
conduct interferes with a full and orderly inspection.
(5) The conduct of the inspection shall be such as to preclude
unreasonable disruptions of the operation(s) of the workplace.
(6) Interviews of employees during the course of the inspection may be
made when such interviews are considered essential to investigative techniques.
(7) Advance notice of inspections. (a) Generally, advance notice of
inspections will not be given as this precludes the opportunity to make
minor or temporary adjustments in an attempt to create a misleading
impression of conditions in an establishment.
(b) There may be occasions when advance notice of inspections
will be necessary in order to conduct an effective inspection or
investigation. When advance notice of inspection is given, employees or
their authorized representative(s) will also be given notice of the
inspection.
(8) The officer need not personally make an inspection of each and
every worksite once every thirty (30) days. He may delegate the responsibility
for such inspections to supervisors or other personnel provided:
(a) Inspections conducted by supervisors or other personnel are
at least as effective as those made by the officer.
(b) Records are made of the inspections and of any discrepancies
found and are forwarded to the officer.
(9) The officer shall maintain records of inspections to include
identification of worksite inspected, date of inspection, description of violations
of standards or other unsafe conditions or practices found, and corrective action
taken toward abatement. Said inspection records shall be subject to review by
the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or his authorized
representative. (1995 Code, § 4-211, as replaced by Ord. #2015-012, Aug. 2015)
4-212. Imminent danger procedures. (1) Any discovery, any
allegation, or any report of imminent danger shall be handled in accordance
with the following procedures:
(a) The officer shall immediately be informed of the alleged
imminent danger situation and he shall immediately ascertain whether
there is a reasonable basis for the allegation.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-34
(b) If the alleged imminent danger situation is determined to
have merit by the officer, he shall make or cause to be made an
immediate inspection of the alleged imminent danger location.
(c) As soon as it is concluded from such inspection that
conditions or practices exist which constitute an imminent danger, the
officer or compliance inspector shall attempt to have the danger
corrected. All employees at the location shall be informed of the danger
and the supervisor or person in charge of the worksite shall be requested
to remove employees from the area, if deemed necessary.
(d) The administrative or operational head of the workplace in
which the imminent danger exists, or his authorized representative, shall
be responsible for determining the manner in which the imminent danger
situation will be abated. This shall be done in cooperation with the officer
or compliance inspector and to the mutual satisfaction of all parties
involved.
(e) The imminent danger shall be deemed abated if:
(i) The imminence of the danger has been eliminated by
removal of employees from the area of danger.
(ii) Conditions or practices which resulted in the
imminent danger have been eliminated or corrected to the point
where an unsafe condition or practice no longer exists.
(f) A written report shall be made by or to the officer describing
in detail the imminent danger and its abatement. This report will be
maintained by the officer in accordance with § 4-211(9) of this plan.
(2) Refusal to abate. (a) Any refusal to abate an imminent danger
situation shall be reported to the officer and/or chief executive officer
immediately.
(b) The officer and/or chief executive officer shall take whatever
action may be necessary to achieve abatement. (1995 Code, § 4-212, as
replaced by Ord. #2015-012, Aug. 2015)
4-213. Abatement orders and hearings. (1) Whenever, as a result of
an inspection or investigation, the officer or compliance inspector(s) finds that
a worksite is not in compliance with the standards, rules or regulations
pursuant to this plan and is unable to negotiate abatement with the
administrative or operational head of the worksite within a reasonable period
of time, the officer shall:
(a) Issue an abatement order to the head of the worksite.
(b) Post, or cause to be posted, a copy of the abatement order at
or near each location referred to in the abatement order.
(2) Abatement orders shall contain the following information:
(a) The standard, rule, or regulation which was found to
violated.
(b) A description of the nature and location of the violation.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-35
(c) A description of what is required to abate or correct the
violation.
(d) A reasonable period of time during which the violation must
be abated or corrected.
(3) At any time within ten (10) days after receipt of an abatement
order, anyone affected by the order may advise the officer in writing of any
objections to the terms and conditions of the order. Upon receipt of such
objections, the officer shall act promptly to hold a hearing with all interested
and/or responsible parties in an effort to resolve any objections. Following such
hearing, the officer shall, within three (3) working days, issue an abatement
order and such subsequent order shall be binding on all parties and shall be
final. (as added by Ord. #2015-12, Aug. 2015)
4-214. Penalties. (1) No civil or criminal penalties shall be issued
against any official, employee, or any other person for failure to comply with
safety and health standards or any rules or regulations issued pursuant to this
program.
(2) Any employee, regardless of status, who willfully and/or repeatedly
violates, or causes to be violated, any safety and health standard, rule, or
regulation or any abatement order shall be subject to disciplinary action by the
appointing authority. It shall be the duty of the appointing authority to
administer discipline by taking action in one of the following ways as
appropriate and warranted:
(a) Oral reprimand
(b) Written reprimand
(c) Suspension for three (3) or more working days
(d) Termination of employment.
(as added by Ord. #2015-12, Aug. 2015)
4-215. Confidentiality of privileged information. All information
obtained by or reported to the officer pursuant to this plan of operation or the
legislation (ordinance, or executive order) enabling this occupational safety and
health program which contains or might reveal information which is otherwise
privileged shall be considered confidential. Such information may be disclosed
to other officials or employees concerned with carrying out this program or when
relevant in any proceeding under this program. Such information may also be
disclosed to the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or their
authorized representatives in carrying out their duties under the Tennessee
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1972. (as added by Ord. #2015-12, Aug.
2015)
4-216. Compliance with other laws not excused. Compliance with
any other law, statute, ordinance, or executive order, as applicable, which
regulates safety and health in employment and places of employment, shall not
Change 3, September 6, 2016 4-36
excuse the employer, the employee, or any other person from compliance with
the provisions of this program.
Compliance with any provisions of this program or any standard, rule,
regulation, or order issued pursuant to this program shall not excuse the
employer, the employee, or any other person from compliance with the law,
statute, ordinance, or executive order, as applicable, regulating and promoting
safety and health unless such law, statute, ordinance, or executive order, as
applicable, is specifically repealed. (as added by Ord. #2015-12, Aug. 2015)

protection here authorized is wholly subordinate to the primary purpose of the
fire department to provide fire protection within the corporate limits, and the
department will not respond to any request for assistance beyond the corporate
limits, under any conditions, if by doing so the protection within the corporate
limits is reduced to an unsafe level. The determination of whether to respond
to an alarm or request for assistance outside the corporate limits is here
delegated to the senior officer of the fire department on duty at the time of
receipt of such request and his decision shall be final. Similarly, any equipment
dispatched to an out of city area in response to a request for assistance, whether
there be a fire in progress or not, shall be ordered back into the city if the level
of fire protection within the city be reduced to an unsafe level by developments
occurring after the dispatch of such equipment to out-of-city area. (1995 Code,
§ 7-604, as renumbered by Ord. #2015-006, April 2015)
7-705. Contribution to costs by private landowners. In order to
help in a small way to pay the cost of the maintenance of a fire department on
a twenty-four (24) hour per day standby basis and the cost of setting up and
maintaining the necessary records, each property owner desiring to contract for
fire protection on a limited basis shall pay to the city the following annual
minimum charge:
(1) Dwelling house and customary accessory buildings, such as garage,
shed, chicken house and so forth, per year--one hundred dollars ($100.00).
(2) Industrial sites, per year--one hundred dollars ($100.00).
In addition thereto there will be an additional charge of one dollar ($1.00)
per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of the assessed valuation of the improvements
located on each residential, commercial or industrial site, as such assessments
are shown in the office of the property assessor for Madison County, for the
calendar year of the effective date of the contract in excess of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00).
If residential, commercial or industrial property is constructed or under
construction, on such residential, commercial or industrial site, same shall be
assessed for purposes of computation of charges at twenty-five percent (25%) of
the estimated cost of construction for residential property, and forty percent
(40%) of the estimated cost of construction on commercial or industrial property.
When same is placed on the tax rolls as completed, the above paragraph shall
be applicable.
If for any reason, residential, commercial or industrial property is not
assessed by the office of the property assessor, same shall be considered for this
section of the Code of the City of Jackson, regarding fire protection outside the
city as though same had been assessed and charges will be made at twenty-five
percent (25%) of the estimated value of the property for residential property and
forty percent (40%) of the estimated value of the property for commercial or
industrial property.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 7-17
The above charges must be paid and contract signed before the fire
department will, under the limitations set out herein, respond to a request for
assistance outside the city. No pledge or promise of payment shall be accepted
at the time of a request for assistance.
Charges here established shall be for the city fiscal year, July 1 - June 30.
Full charge will be made from July 1 - December 31 of each fiscal year. Half
price shall be charged from January 1 - June 30. All contracts expire June 30th
of each year unless renewed at least five (5) days prior to such date. No new
contract shall be effective for five (5) full days following its execution in order to
provide proper time to set up card files and books. No contract shall be
transferable from one owner to another. Only the owner of property may
contract as provided herein. No payments made in pursuance to this chapter
shall be refundable. (1995 Code, § 7-605, as renumbered by Ord. #2015-006,
April 2015)
7-706. Responsibility of city. The city, while willing to provide as
much protection as possible under the limitations set out herein and in its
contract, recognizes that conditions may arise which could cause no response at
all to a call for help outside the city whether a contract has been signed and
charges paid or not. Because of this, charges have been held to a minimum. Any
applicant for such service is required to recognize in the contract that the
property owner also recognizes that conditions may arise under which his
request for assistance outside the city limits will not be honored and that the
property owner accepts the contract on that condition and will hold the City of
Jackson harmless from any and all claim, suit or demand for such failure to
respond. (1995 Code, § 7-606, as renumbered by Ord. #2015-006, April 2015)
7-707. Cancellation of contracts by city. The contracts here
authorized may be canceled by an ordinance of the city, provided thirty (30) days
notice of same be given prior to the adoption of such ordinance. (1995 Code,

aircraft using visual approach procedures. (1995 Code, § 14-302)
14-303. Airport zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this
chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include
all land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal
surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to McKellar Field Airport. Such
zones are shown on the McKellar Field Airport Zoning Map, dated September
28, 1978, which is made a part of this chapter. An area located in more than one
of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
(1) Utility runway visual approach zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two
hundred fifty feet (250') wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly
to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet feet (1,250') at a horizontal
distance of five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its center line
is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
(2) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as
three-fourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one
thousand feet (1,000') wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to
a width of four thousand feet (4,000') at a horizontal distance of ten thousand
feet (10,000') from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the
center line of the runway.
(3) Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one
thousand feet (1,000') wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to
a width of sixteen thousand feet (16,000') at a horizontal distance of fifty
thousand feet (50,000') from the primary surface. Its center line is the
continuation of the center line of the runway.
(4) Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
14-7
(5) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of ten thousand feet (10,000') from the center of each end of the primary
surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines
tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.
(6) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward
therefrom from a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). (1995 Code,
§ 14-303)
14-304. Airport zone height limitations. Except as otherwise
provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained,
and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a
height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone. Such
applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in
question as follows:
(1) Utility runway visual approach zone. Slopes twenty feet (20')
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand
feet (5,000') along the extended runway center line.
(2) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as
three-fourth mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. Slopes thirty-four
feet (34') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten
thousand feet (10,000') along the extended runway center line.
(3) Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes fifty feet (50')
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand
feet (10,000') along the extended runway center line; thence slopes upward forty
feet (40') horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance
of forty thousand feet (40,000') along the extended runway center line.
(4) Transitional zones. Slopes seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty
feet (150') above the airport elevation which is 583.51 feet above mean sea level.
In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven
feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of the same
elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the
conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects
beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet
(7') outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same
elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') measured at ninety (90E) degree angles to the extended
runway center line.
14-8
(5) Horizontal zone. Established at one hundred fifty feet (150') above
the airport elevation or at a height of 583.51 feet above mean sea level.
(6) Conical zone. Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 783.51 feet above
the airport elevation.
(7) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or
growth of any tree to a height up to fifty feet (50') above the surface of the land
except when the height exceeds the airport zone height limitations established
for such zone in this section. (1995 Code, § 14-304)
14-305. Use restrictions. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this chapter no use may be made of land or water within any zone established
by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft,
make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others,
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way
endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft
intending to use the airport.
(2) Adjacent residential zoning shall take into account expected noise
levels and their effect on residential development in terms of Federal Housing
Programs as set forth in the McKellar Field Airport Master Plan, Land Use Plan
Map dated December 5, 1974, prepared by E. R. Dike and Associates and
McKellar Field Off-Airport Land Use Study, dated March 1, 1979, prepared by
Colloredo Associates, Inc.

property located within the airport approach zones for a length of five thousand
eighty feet (5,080') beginning two hundred feet (200') outward from the end of
the runway, and extending outward, ending at a point five thousand two
hundred eighty feet (5,280') from the end of the runway on the extended center
line of the runway. A building or premises may be used for any purposes
permitted by the use regulations of the zone district in which the property is

14-306. Nonconforming uses. (1) Regulations not retroactive. The
regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering, of other change or alteration of any structure not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall
require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport administrator
to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence
of such airport obstructions. Such marker and lights shall be installed, operated
and maintained at the expense of the airport authority. (1995 Code, § 14-306)
14-307. Permits. (1) Future uses. Except as specifically provided in
subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereunder no material change shall be made in the
use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted.
Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the
resulting use structure, would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If
such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit
for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless
a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (4).
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than fifty feet (50') of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but
at a horizontal distance of not less than two thousand seven hundred feet
(2,700') from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any
tree or structure less than fifty feet (50') of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such approach zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than fifty feet (50') of vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land
14-10
contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established
by this chapter except as set forth in § 14-304(6).
(2) Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, or
structure, to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the
effective date of this chapter or than it is when the application for such a permit
shall be granted.
(3) Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city
building official determines that a nonconforming use or structure has been
abandoned or more than seventy-five percent (75%) torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such
structure to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the
zoning regulations.
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance. When a nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, is discontinued, or abandoned for six (6)
consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period,
the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
Zoning Resolution of Jackson, Tennessee Planning Region. When a
nonconforming use of any land or building has been discontinued for a period of
one (1) year it shall not be reestablished or changed to any use not in conformity
with the provisions of the district in which it is located.
Madison County Zoning Resolution Outer Region Abandoned--
discontinuance of one (1) year.
(4) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of
any structure, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed
in this chapter may apply to the board of zoning appeals for a variance from
such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use
of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found
that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship, and relief granted will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice,
and will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this chapter may be considered
by the board of zoning appeals unless a copy of the application has been
furnished to the Jackson-Madison County Airport Authority for advice as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Jackson-Madison County Airport
14-11
Authority does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after
receipt, the board of zoning appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said
application.
(5) Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at
owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the board of zoning appeals, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the airport authority at its own expense, to install, operate,
and maintain the necessary markings and lights. (1995 Code, § 14-307)
14-308. Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the city building official
to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for
permits and variances shall be made to the city building official upon a form
published for that purpose. Applications required by this chapter to be
submitted to the city building official shall be promptly considered and granted
or denied. Application for action by the board of zoning appeals shall be
forthwith transmitted by the city building official. (1995 Code, § 14-308)

(2) Purpose. The code creates the legal framework for signage
regulations that are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable communication
between people. It recognizes the need to protect the safety and welfare of the
public, the need for well maintained and attractive appearance in a community,
and the need for adequate business identification and advertising and
communication. This code recognizes that aesthetics and design quality cannot
be satisfactorily legislated, as individual opinions vary and general public
opinions vary from one area to another. It is recognized, however, that a great
percentage of that which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible quality
control, through adequate maintenance and inspection and by reasonable
guidelines formulated to minimize clutter.
This code authorizes the use of signs visible from public rights-of-way
provided the signs are:
(a) Compatible with their surroundings, pursuant to the
objectives of proper design and zoning amenities.

standards; establishing a sign code board of appeals; providing for
administration and procedures; requiring licenses and the payment of fees;
providing for penalties.

unless and until the sign is altered or relocated.
Every sign permit issued by the administrator shall become null and void
if work is not commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date
of such permit. If work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned
for one hundred twenty (120) days any time after the work is commenced, a new
permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee will be one-half (1/2) the
amount required for a new permit for such work, provided that no changes have
been made in the original plans. Such permit may not be unreasonably
withheld, providing that proper application and payment of permit fees is
complied with.

the administrator upon a form provided by the administrator and shall be
accompanied by such information as may be required to assure compliance with
all appropriate laws and regulations of the city, including:

the premises where the sign is located or to be located.
(c) Clear and legible drawings with description definitely
showing location of the sign which is the subject of the permit and all
other existing signs whose construction requires permits, when such
signs are on the same premises.
(d) Drawings showing the dimensions, construction supports,
sizes, electrical wiring and components, materials of the sign and method
of attachment and character of structural members to which attachment
is to be made. The design, quality, materials and loading shall conform

under provisions of this section whenever the permit is issued on the basis of a
misstatement of fact or fraud. When a sign permit is denied by the
administrator, he shall give written notice of the denial to the applicant,
together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the denial.
(5) Effect of issuance. No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be

this section, the fees specified hereunder shall be doubled but the payment of
such double fee shall not relieve any person from complying with other
provisions of this section or from penalties prescribed herein:

the requirements of this code is filed, shall be grounds for appeal to the
sign code board of appeals, under the terms of § 14-413(5) of this code.

within ten (10) days of application;
(b) Grant variances from the requirements of this code as part
of the disposition of an appeal from action of the administrator denying
or failing to grant a sign permit;
(c) Hear and decide appeals of a determination by the
administrator that a sign must be removed for noncompliance with this
code; or
Change 3, September 6, 2016 14-41
(d) Make recommendations to the city council for changes to
this code;
(e) Give advice to the sign code administrator.
(4) Criteria for board decision. (a) Appeals without petition for
variance. In appeals to the board from decisions of the administrator
denying a sign permit in connection with which no petition for variance
has been filed, the board's scope of review shall be limited to determining
whether or not the administrator's decision is in accordance with the
requirements of this code and accordingly, affirm or reverse his decision.
No variance from the requirements of this code shall be granted or
allowed. If the administrator's decision is reversed, the board shall direct
the administrator to issue the permit in accordance with its decision. If
the administrator fails to do so for five (5) days from receipt of the
direction from the board, the board may issue the permit.
In appeals from failure of the administrator to grant a permit
within ten (10) days of application, the board shall determine whether the
sign and the application meet the requirements of this code. If so, the
board shall grant the permit; if not, the board shall deny the permit. No
variance from the requirements of the code shall be granted or allowed.
(b) Apply with petition for variance. In appeals from decisions
of the administrator denying or refusing to grant a sign permit in
connection with which the appealing party or any other interested party
has filed a petition for variance, the board shall have the power and duty
to hear, decide and grant or deny the requested variance from the
provisions or requirements of this code. The board may grant a variance
from the provisions or requirements of this code only where:
(i) The literal interpretation and strict application of the
provisions and requirements of this code would cause undue and
unnecessary hardship to the sign user because of unique or
unusual conditions pertaining to the specific building or parcel or
property in question; and
(ii) The granting of the requested variance would not
materially be detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity;
and
(iii) The unusual conditions applying to the specific
property do not apply generally to other properties in the city; and
(iv) The granting of the variance will not be contrary to
the general objective of this code of moderating the size, number
and obtrusive placement of signs and the reduction of clutter.
Where there is insufficient evidence, in the opinion of the board, to
support a finding of "undue and unnecessary hardship" under
§ 14-413(4)(b)(i) above, but some hardship does exist, the board
may consider the requirement fulfilled if:
Change 3, September 6, 2016 14-42
(A) The proposed signing is of particularly good
design and in particularly good taste; and
(B) The entire site has been or will be particularly
well landscaped. In granting a variance, the board may
attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed sign as it may
deem necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this
code in the public interest.
(5) Perfection of appeal. An appeal with or without petition for
variance may be considered by the board only if:
(a) Written notice of appeal, with or without petition for
variance, is filed with the board:
(i) Within ten (10) days of the decision of the
administrator denying a sign permit;
(ii) Within twenty (20) days of the submission of a sign
permit application which the administrator has neither granted or
denied within ten (10) days.
(b) The notice of appeal is accompanied by a fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) this fee shall be paid at the time of the petition.
(c) The application shall be completed and received by the
administrator at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting date at
which the petition is to be considered. The board shall, on its own motion,
or on the motion of any interested party, dismiss an appeal for failure of
the appellant to meet any of the requirements of this section or for failure
of the appellant to otherwise diligently prosecute the appeal, or if the
board finds the appellant has made any knowingly false or misleading
statements or representations in his sign application or appeal.
(6) Board procedure. (a) General. The voting members of the board
shall choose a chairman from among their number who shall serve a term
of one (1) year. The board shall adopt rules and regulations for its own
government. The presence of at least three (3) of the five (5) voting
members of the board and an affirmative vote of a majority of those
present at any meeting shall be required for any board decision or action.
(b) Procedure upon appeal; delivery of sign application to board.
Notice of appeal shall be filed with the administrator for delivery to the
board. The administrator shall promptly transmit to the sign code board
of appeals, the appropriate application for a sign permit, the written
notice of denial with reasons therefor, together with all plans,
specifications and other papers pertaining to the application. When the
appeal is from failure of the administrator to grant a permit within ten
(10) days, the administrator shall, in addition to the foregoing, furnish
the board with a brief written statement of the reasons for the failure.
(c) Statement in support of administrator's position. Upon any
appeal, the administrator may, in his discretion, furnish the board with

14-501. Purpose. Within the City of Jackson, soil erosion and
stormwater from construction sites contribute to the impairment of the flood
plain, increased street maintenance cost, clogging of storm sewers, degradation
of land surfaces and streams, flooding and dusty conditions. This chapter is to
authorize the establishment of procedures to reduce erosion and sediment
problems resulting from the development process of land within the City of
Jackson and the increase in urban runoff from developed land. (1995 Code,
§ 14-501)
14-502. Permit required. Except as exempted in § 14-503 of this
chapter, whenever development will involve any clearing, grading, any form of
land disturbance caused by movement of earth or increase in stormwater runoff
due to the decrease of soil permeability, no land shall be disturbed within the
City of Jackson unless a grading permit therefor has been issued by the city
engineer. The city engineer shall collect a fee for each grading permit issued
which amount shall go to the general fund of the city. Said fee shall be in

local ordinance. The environmental advisory/appeals board, when appealed to
and after hearing, may vary the provisions of the rules and regulations in
respect to a particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would
do manifest injustice, and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this
code, or public interest, or when, in its opinion, the interpretation of the rules
and regulations by the city engineer should be modified or reversed. The board
shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.
Each decision of the board shall also include the reasons for the decision. Every
decision of the environmental advisory/appeals board shall be final, subject
however to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law or equity.

14-606. Appeals.
14-607. Variances.
14-601. Purpose. The uncontrolled discharge of pollutants into the
stormwater system has an adverse impact upon the water quality of the
receiving waters.
(1) The 1987 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
commonly known as the "Clean Water Act," established the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, which requires permits for
discharges from municipal stormwater systems into the waters of the United
States. The Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated regulations
implementing the NPDES Program, Phase 2.
(2) The NPDES Phase 2 regulations for stormwater discharges require
certain municipalities, including the City of Jackson, to:
(a) Prohibit through ordinance or other regulatory mechanism,
illicit discharges to the municipal stormwater system;

of the city stormwater management program to prevent certain non-stormwater
discharges to, and improper disposal of substances in, the stormwater system,
as to reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, pollutants that may be present
in discharges from the stormwater system. (Ord. #2001-050, Nov. 2001)
14-603. Permits. Stormwater discharges in the City of Jackson will be
covered under a permit issued by the Tennessee Department of Environment
Change 3, September 6, 2016 14-50
and Conservation. The city will not require individual permits for stormwater
discharges except for those dischargers found to be in violation of this chapter,
by the city engineer or his designee. Those found to be in violation will be
required to apply for a special stormwater permit issued by the city engineer.

Jackson-Madison County Regional Planning Commission for review and
approval at a regular or special meeting of the commission. Upon such approval
becoming final, the city engineer shall cause the rules and regulations to be
published and made available to the public in his office without charge. Such
rules and regulations shall be based upon sound principles of engineering,
biology, and ecology, shall be consistent with the rules and regulations by the
Environmental Protection Agency's stormwater program, the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase 2 Rule. The rules and
regulations written by the city engineer shall contain appropriate provisions for
the enforcement of this code and the rules and regulations, including provisions
requiring offenders to obtain a special permit for stormwater discharges and for
issuing a cease and desist order for illicit discharges. (Ord. #2001-050, Nov.
2001)

corporation violating any of the provisions the rules and regulations shall be
required to take the remedial actions and be subject to civil penalties as follows:
(1) If found to be in violation of the City of Jackson's General
Stormwater Permit by discharging illicit or improper materials into the city
storm sewers, the offender shall be required to obtain a special permit for
connection to the city storm sewer network.
(2) The city shall have the right to recover the lesser of four hundred
fifty dollars ($450.00) day for each day that the violation exists or all damages
proximately caused by the violation to the municipality, which may include any
reasonable expenses incurred in investigating violations, expenses involved in
rectifying any damages, costs and attorney fees incurred by the city as the result
of enforcing this chapter.
(3) In addition to the above remedial measures, any person, firm or
corporation guilty of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a fine of up to fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day the violation
exists, beginning the first day of the violation and continuing each day
thereafter until the violation is corrected. Each day that a violation of this
chapter exists shall constitute a separate offense.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 14-51
(4) In addition to the remedies and civil penalties set forth above, the
City of Jackson may bring legal action to enjoin the continuing violation of this
chapter and the existence of any other remedy, at law or equity, shall be no
defense to any such actions.
(5) The remedies and penalties set forth in this section shall be
cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil or
criminal, that one or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought or
granted. (Ord. #2001-050, Nov. 2001)
14-606. Appeals. Whenever the city engineer shall issue a cease and
desist order or require a special discharge permit for any reason, including an
interpretation of the rules and regulations, any person affected by such order or
special permit requirement, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal the
decision of the city engineer to the environmental advisory/appeals board. Notice
of appeals shall be in writing and filed with the city engineer within thirty (30)
days after the decision of the city engineer. Appeals shall be on forms provided
by the city engineer. (Ord. #2001-050, Nov. 2001)
14-607. Variances. Variances shall not violate any federal, state or
local ordinance. The environmental advisory/appeals board, when appealed to
and after hearing, may vary the provisions of the rules and regulations in
respect to a particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would
do manifest injustice, and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this
code, or public interest, or when, in its opinion, the interpretation of the rules
and regulations by the city engineer should be modified or reversed. The board
shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.
In reaching a decision the board must consider the specific requirements of state
and federal law. If a decision of the board reverses or modifies an order or
special permit requirement by the city engineer or varies the application of any
provision of this code, the minutes of the meeting of the board must be specific
as to the reasons for the reversal, modification or change in application by the
board. The city engineer shall immediately take action in accordance with such
a decision. Every decision of the environmental advisory/appeals board shall be
final subject however to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law
or equity. (Ord. #2001-050, Nov. 2001)

probably will be accomplished without injury or damage to any person or
property. The application must be submitted at least three (3) days in advance
of the contemplated operation, must be in such form as prescribed by the chief
of police, and must be accompanied by an indemnity bond in the amount of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), which indemnity bond shall inure to the benefit

15-202. Maximum load limits. The city engineer is hereby authorized
to determine the maximum load limit allowable on the city streets, such
maximum load limit to mean the gross weight of any vehicle including its load.
In establishing such limits, the city engineer will determine the maximum gross
weight which may be moved upon a city street without damage to that street
and shall consider all pertinent factors including age of street, subgrade, base,
surfacing, drainage, culverts, bridges and similar factors. When, in the opinion
of the engineer, it is necessary to establish a maximum load limit for the
protection of a street, a clearly marked sign shall be erected at both ends of such
street setting forth (1) the maximum permissible weight on the street and (2)
the fact that the use of the street by vehicles of greater gross weight is
prohibited. Following the erection of such sign, it shall be unlawful for any
vehicle of a greater gross weight to use such city street. (1995 Code, § 15-202)

with the approval of the Jackson planning commission, may, and is hereby
authorized, to designate by resolution such city streets as, in their opinion,

require the limiting of truck traffic thereon and meet the criteria established
below for the limiting of truck traffic on such streets.
In determining a need for such limitation, the city council may consider
all pertinent factors thereto, including traffic, neighborhood use, alternate
available routes, safety of persons, especially children, property values, esthetic
values of neighborhood property, necessity of such use by trucks, and other
factors. The limitation imposed upon any city street may include limitations as
to size of vehicle, as to nature of service offered through the use of such vehicle,
hours of use permitted or prohibited for trucks, day or days prohibited or
permitted for such use.
Each such street so limited shall be marked by a clearly visible sign on
either end of such street which shall clearly and accurately set forth the
limitations applicable to such street. Following the posting of such signs and the
passage of such resolution it shall be unlawful for any vehicle to which
limitations are applicable to use such street in violation of the limitations. (1995
Code, § 15-203)

recommend to the city council such truck routes as are necessary and proper for
the quick, safe and efficient movement of through truck traffic through the city
and such routes may be so established by resolution of the council. Upon the
passage of such resolution the routes so established shall be properly and clearly
marked by visible signs indicating "truck route" and the identification of the
highway route. A proper sign, clearly visible, shall be placed at each entrance
to the city informing travelers that city ordinances requires trucks to follow
routes while passing through the city. Thereafter all trucks en route through the
city will follow such routes and will not enter upon the streets of the city.
(2) Compliance by trucks. All motor vehicles which are reasonably
described as "trucks," including but not limited to pick-up trucks, tank trucks,
dump trucks, trailer trucks, trucks of the Armed Forces (state and federal), and
special purpose trucks, shall observe and follow marked truck routes while
traveling in or through this city. When signs designating truck routes are
erected it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to drive, park or tow any
vehicle described herein on any street, alley or highway not marked as a truck
route unless the person has legal and reasonable business which reasonably
necessitates his using such vehicle on such unauthorized street, alley or
highway. (1995 Code, § 15-204)
15-205. Commercial vehicles prohibited from using certain
streets. When signs are erected giving notice hereof, no person shall operate
any commercial vehicle exceeding the posted weight at any time upon any of the
streets or parts of streets where such signs are posted, except that such vehicles
may be operated thereon for the purpose of delivering or picking up materials
or merchandise and then only by entering such street at the intersection nearest

intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.
(2) Such driver after having stopped shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is
approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute an immediate hazard, but
the driver having so yielded may proceed and the drivers of all other vehicles
approaching the intersection shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle so
proceeding. (1995 Code, § 15-705)
15-706. At "yield" signs. (1) The driver of a vehicle approaching a
"yield" sign shall in obedience to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions, or shall stop if necessary, and shall yield the
right-of-way to any pedestrian legally crossing the roadway on which he is
driving, and to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another
highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard. The driver having so
yielded may proceed, and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the
intersection shall yield to the vehicle so proceeding; provided, however, that a
driver who enters a "yield" intersection without stopping and has or causes a
collision with a pedestrian in a crosswalk or a vehicle in the intersection shall
prima facie be considered not to have yielded as required herein. The foregoing
shall not relieve the drivers of other vehicles approaching the intersection at
15-29
such distance as not to constitute an immediate hazard from the duty to drive
with due care to avoid a collision.
(2) The driver of a vehicle approaching a "yield" sign if required for
safety to stop, shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection or, in the event there is no crosswalk, at a clearly marked stop line,
but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver
has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. (1995 Code,
§ 15-706)
15-707. At traffic control signals generally. Traffic control signals
exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or "Stop," or exhibiting different colored
lights successively one at a time, or with arrows, shall show the following colors
only and shall apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
(1) Green alone, or "Go":
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight
through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits such
turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall
yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within
the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
(2) Steady yellow alone, or "Caution":
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
red or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such
vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the
red or "Stop" signal is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing such signal shall not enter the roadway
unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
(3) Steady red alone, or "Stop":
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "Go"
is shown alone. Provided, however, that generally a right turn on a red
signal shall be permitted at all intersections within the city, provided
that the prospective turning car comes to a full and complete stop before
turning and that the turning car yields the right of way to pedestrians
and cross traffic traveling in accordance with their traffic signal.
However, said turn shall not endanger other traffic lawfully using said
intersection. A right turn on red shall be permitted at all intersections
except those clearly marked by a "No Turns On Red" sign, which may be
erected by the city at intersections which the city decides require no right
turns on red in the interest of traffic safety.
15-30
(b) Pedestrians facing such signal shall not enter the roadway
unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
(4) Steady red with green arrow:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(b) Pedestrians facing such signal shall not enter the roadway
unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal.
(5) In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section
shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have
no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the
pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking the stop shall be made a vehicle length short of the signal.
(1995 Code, § 15-707)
15-708. At flashing traffic control signals. (1) Whenever an
illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal placed
or erected in the city it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
(a) Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated
with intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering
the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked,
or if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed
shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
(b) Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is
illuminated with intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed
through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
(2) This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct
of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
the rules set forth in § 15-704 of this code. (1995 Code, § 15-708)
15-709. At pedestrian control signals. Wherever special pedestrian
control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Wait" or "Don't Walk" have been
placed or erected by the city, such signals shall apply as follows:
(1) Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the
roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
(2) Wait or Don't Walk. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety
zone while the wait signal is showing. (1995 Code, § 15-709)
15-31
15-710. Stops to be signaled. No person operating a motor vehicle
shall stop such vehicle, whether in obedience to a traffic sign or signal or
otherwise, without first signaling his intention in accordance with the
requirements of the state law,1 except in an emergency. (1995 Code, § 15-710)
15-711. Obstructing intersections prohibited. No driver shall enter
an intersection or a marked crosswalk unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the intersection or crosswalk to accommodate the vehicle he is
operating without obstructing the passage of other vehicles or pedestrians,
notwithstanding any traffic control signal indication to proceed (1995 Code,

18-302. Standards. The municipal public water supply is to comply
with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-101, et seq., as well as the Rules and
Regulations for Public Water Supplies, legally adopted in accordance with this
code, which pertain to cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, and
interconnections, and establish an effective ongoing program to control these
undesirable water uses. (1995 Code, § 18-302, modified)
18-303. Construction, operation, and supervision. It shall be
unlawful for any person to cause a cross connection to be made, or allow one to
exist for any purpose whatsoever, unless the construction and operation of same
have been approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and

bypass or interconnection is at all times under the direct supervision of the
general manager of the Jackson Utility Division or his representative. (1995
Code, § 18-303)
18-304. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply and who also has on the same premises
a separate source of water supply, or stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water stored therein is circulated through a
piping system, shall file with the general manager of the Jackson Utility
Division a statement of the non-existence of unapproved or unauthorized cross
connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections. Such statement
shall also contain an agreement that no cross connection, auxiliary intake,
bypass, or interconnection will be permitted upon the premises. (1995 Code,
§ 18-304)
18-305. Inspections required. It shall be the duty of the Jackson
Public Water Supply to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by

18-7
therein for cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections.
On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property so served shall
furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping
system or systems on such property. The refusal of such information or refusal
of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross
connections. (1995 Code, § 18-306)
18-307. Correction of existing violations. (1) Any person who now
has cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections in
violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time
within which to comply with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough
investigation of existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to
complete the work, the amount of time shall be designated by the general
manager of the Jackson Utility Division.
(2) The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public
water system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
general manager of the Jackson Utility Division shall be grounds for denial of
water service. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable
time, the general manager of the Jackson Utility Division shall give the
customer legal notification that water service is to be discontinued and shall
physically separate the public water supply from the customer's on-site piping
system in such a manner that the two systems cannot again be connected by an
unauthorized person.
(3) Where cross connections, interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or
bypasses are found that constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern of
contaminating the public water system, the management of the water supply
shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat
to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the
public water supply from the on-site piping system unless the imminent
hazard(s) is (are) corrected immediately. (1995 Code, § 18-307)
18-308. Use of protective devices. (1) Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water department is such that it is deemed:
(a) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation;
(b) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or
is not willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the system, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of
the plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability
of the water supply;
(c) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises
are such that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing;
(d) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be
subverted, altered, or disconnected, the general manager of the Jackson
18-8
Utility Division or his designated representative, shall require the use of
an approved protective device on the service line serving the premises to
assure that any contamination that may originate in the customer's
premises is contained therein. The protective device shall be a reduced
pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation as to manufacture, model,
and size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall
be approved by the general manager of the Jackson Utility Division prior
to installation and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. The
installation shall be at the expense of the owner or occupant of the
premises.
(2) Personnel of the municipal public water supply shall have the right
to inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the general manager of the Jackson Utility Division or his
designated representative. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the
device without the knowledge of the occupant of the premises.
(3) Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal
operations or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be
provided to avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair
the protective device or devices. Where it is found that only one (1) unit has been
installed and the continuance of service is critical, the general manager of the
Jackson Utility Division shall notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of
plans to discontinue water service and arrange for a mutually acceptable time
to test and/or repair the device. The general manager of the Jackson Utility
Division shall require the occupant of the premises to make all repairs indicated
promptly, to keep the unit(s) working properly, and the expense of such repairs
shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made
by qualified personnel acceptable to the general manager of the Jackson Utility
Division.
(4) The failure to maintain backflow prevention devices in proper
working order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises.
Likewise, the removal, bypassing, or altering of the protective devices or the
installation thereof so as to render the devices ineffective shall constitute
grounds for discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises
shall not be restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such
conditions or defects to the satisfaction of the general manager of the Jackson
Utility Division. (1995 Code, § 18-308)
18-309. Unpotable water to be labeled. In order that the potable
water supply made available to premises served by the public water supply shall
be protected from possible contamination as specified herein, any water outlet
which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied
by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
18-9
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one (1) inch high
located on a red background. (1995 Code, § 18-309)
18-310. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the city water system whether located inside or outside
the corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the conditions required to be
met for the city to provide water services to any premises. Such action, being
essential for the protection of the water distribution system against the entrance
of contamination which may render the water unsafe healthwise, or otherwise
undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard to location of the premises,
whether inside or outside the corporate limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
therefor, shall be fined under the general penalty clause for this municipal code
of ordinances. In addition, the general manager of the Jackson Utility Division
of the City of Jackson shall discontinue the public water supply service at any
premises upon which there is found to be a cross-connection, auxiliary intake,
bypass or interconnection, and service shall not be restored until such crossconnection,
auxiliary intake, bypass or interconnection has been discontinued.

spend more than $500, and candidates for other offices that pay at least $100 a
month are required to file campaign financial disclosure reports. Civil penalties
of $25 per day are authorized for late filings. Penalties up to the greater of
$10,000 or 15 percent of the amount in controversy may be levied for filings
more than 35 days late. It is a Class E felony for a multicandidate political
campaign committee with a prior assessment record to intentionally fail to file
a required campaign financial report. Further, the treasurer of such a committee
may be personally liable for any penalty levied by the Registry of Election
Finance (T.C.A. § 2-10-101118).
Contributions to political campaigns for municipal candidates are limited to:
a. $1,000 from any person (including corporations and other
organizations);
b. $5,000 from a multicandidate political campaign committee;
c. $20,000 from the candidate;
d. $20,000 from a political party; and
e. $75,000 from multicandidate political campaign committees.
The Registry of Election Finance may impose a maximum penalty of $10,000 or
115 percent of the amount of all contributions made or accepted in excess of
these limits, whichever is greater (T.C.A. § 2-10-301310).
Each candidate for local public office must prepare a report of contributions that
includes the receipt date of each contribution and a political campaign
committees statement indicating the date of each expenditure (T.C.A.
§ 2-10-105, 107).
Candidates are prohibited from converting leftover campaign funds to personal
use. The funds must be returned to contributors, put in the volunteer public
education trust fund, or transferred to another political campaign fund, a
political party, a charitable or civic organization, educational institution, or an
organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(c) (T.C.A. § 2-10-114).
2. Conflicts of Interest.
Municipal officers and employees are permitted to have an indirect interest in
contracts with their municipality if the officers or employees publicly
acknowledge their interest. An indirect interest is any interest that is not
direct, except it includes a direct interest if the officer is the only supplier of
APP-A-2
goods or services in a municipality. A direct interest is any contract with the
official himself or with any business of which the official is the sole proprietor,
a partner, or owner of the largest number of outstanding shares held by any
individual or corporation. Except as noted, direct interests are absolutely
prohibited (T.C.A. § 6-2-402, T.C.A. § 6-20-205, T.C.A. § 6-54-107108,
T.C.A. § 12-4-101102).
3. Disclosure conflict of interests.
Conflict of interest disclosure reports by any candidate or appointee to a local
public office are required under T.C.A. §§ 8-50-501 et seq. Detailed financial
information is required, including the names of corporations or organizations in
which the official or one immediate family member has an investment of over
$10,000 or 5 percent of the total capital. This must be filed no later than 30 days
after the last day legally allowed for qualifying as a candidate. As long as an
elected official holds office, he or she must file an amended statement with the
Tennessee Ethics Commission or inform that office in writing that an amended
statement is not necessary because nothing has changed. The amended
statement must be filed no later than January 31 of each year
(T.C.A. § 8-50-504).
4. Consulting fee prohibition for elected municipal officials.
Any member or member-elect of a municipal governing body is prohibited under
T.C.A. § 2-10-124 from knowingly receiving any form of compensation for
consulting services other than compensation paid by the state, county, or
municipality. Violations are punishable as Class C felonies if the conduct
constitutes bribery under T.C.A. § 39-16-102. Other violations are prosecuted
as Class A misdemeanors. A conviction under either statute disqualifies the
offender from holding any office under the laws or Constitution of the State of
Tennessee.
Consulting services under T.C.A. § 2-10-122 means services to advise or assist
a person or entity in influencing legislative or administrative action, as that
term is defined in § 3-6-301, relative to the municipality or county represented
by that official. Consulting services also means services to advise or assist a
person or entity in maintaining, applying for, soliciting or entering into a
contract with the municipality represented by that official. "Consulting
services" does not mean the practice or business of law in connection with
representation of clients by a licensed attorney in a contested case action,
administrative proceeding or rule making procedure;
APP-A-3
"Compensation" does not include an honorarium under T.C.A. § 2-10-116, or
certain gifts under T.C.A. § 3-6-305(b), which are defined and prohibited under
those statutes.
The attorney general construes "Consulting services" to include advertising or
other informational services that directly promote specific legislation or
specifically target legislators or state executive officials. Advertising aimed at
the general public that does not promote or otherwise attempt to influence
specific legislative or administrative action is not prohibited. Op. Atty.Gen. No.

T.C.A. § 39-16-102, or a public servant who is convicted of accepting a bribe
under the statute, commits a Class B felony.
b. Under T.C.A. § 39-16-103, a person convicted of bribery is disqualified
from ever holding office again in the state. Conviction while in office will not
end the persons term of office under this statute, but a person may be removed
from office pursuant to any law providing for removal or expulsion existing prior
to the conviction.
c. A public servant who requests a pecuniary benefit for performing an
act the person would have had to perform without the benefit or for a lesser fee,

under T.C.A. § 39-16-104.
d. A public servant convicted of buying and selling in regard to offices
under T.C.A. § 39-16-105, may be found guilty of a Class C felony. Offenses

refusing to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office for pecuniary gain, or
entering into any kind of borrowing or selling for anything of value with regard
to the office.
e. Exceptions to 1, 3, and 4, above include lawful contributions to political
campaigns, and a trivial benefit that is incidental to personal, professional,
or business contacts in which there is no danger of undermining an officials
impartiality.

candidates for nomination or election to public office, and persons performing
a governmental function under claim of right even though not qualified to do so.
b. Official misconduct under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-402
pertains to acts related to a public servants office or employment committed
with an intent to obtain a benefit or to harm another. Acts constituting an
offense include the unauthorized exercise of official power, acts exceeding ones
official power, failure to perform a duty required by law, and receiving a benefit
not authorized by law. Offenses under this section constitute a Class E felony.
c. Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-403, Official oppression,
a public servant acting in an official capacity who intentionally arrests, detains,
frisks, etc., or intentionally prevents another from enjoying a right or privilege
commits a Class E felony.
d. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-404 prohibits a public servants use
of information attained in an official capacity, to attain a benefit or aid another
which has not been made public. Offenses under the section are Class B
misdemeanors.
e. A public servant convicted for any of the offenses summarized in
sections 2-4 above shall be removed from office or discharged from a position of
employment, in addition to the criminal penalties provided for each offense.
Additionally, an elected or appointed official is prohibited from holding another
appointed or elected office for ten (10) years. At-will employees convicted will
be discharged, but are not prohibited from working in public service for any
specific period. Subsequent employment is left to the discretion of the hiring
entity for those employees. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-406.
7. Ouster law.
Some Tennessee city charters include ouster provisions, but the only general law
procedure for removing elected officials from office is judicial ouster. Cities are
entitled to use their municipal charter ouster provisions, or they may proceed
under state law.
The judicial ouster procedure applies to all officers, including people holding any
municipal office of trust or profit. (Note that it must be an office filled by an
officer, distinguished from an employee holding a position that does not
have the attributes of an office.) The statute makes any officer subject to such
removal who shall knowingly or willfully misconduct himself in office, or who
shall knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such
officer by any of the laws of the state, or who shall in any public place be in a
state of intoxication produced by strong drink voluntarily taken, or who shall
APP-A-5
engage in any form of illegal gambling, or who shall commit any act constituting
a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude (T.C.A. § 8-47-101).
T.C.A. § 8-47-122(b) allows the taxing of costs and attorney fees against the
complainant in an ouster suit if the complaint subsequently is withdrawn or
deemed meritless. Similarly, after a final judgment in an ouster suit,
governments may order reimbursement of attorney fees to the officer targeted
in a failed ouster attempt
(T.C.A. § 8-47-121).
The local attorney general or city attorney has a legal duty to investigate a
written allegation that an officer has been guilty of any of the mentioned
offenses. If he or she finds that there is reasonable cause for such complaint, he
shall forthwith institute proceedings in the Circuit, Chancery, or Criminal Court
of the proper county. However, with respect to the city attorney, there may be
an irreconcilable conflict between that duty and the city attorneys duties to the
city, the mayor, and the rules of professional responsibility governing attorneys.
Also, an attorney general or city attorney may act on his or her own initiative
without a formal complaint (T.C.A. § 8-47-101102). The officer must be
removed from office if found guilty (T.C.A. § 8-47-120).

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM
PLAN APPENDIX II
NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES OF City of Jackson
The Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1972 provides job safety
and health protection for Tennessee workers through the promotion of safe and
healthful working conditions. Under a plan reviewed by the Tennessee
Department of Labor and Workforce Development, this government, as an
employer, is responsible for administering the Act to its employees. Safety and
health standards are the same as State standards and jobsite inspections will
be conducted to insure compliance with the Act.
Employees shall be furnished conditions of employment and a place of
employment free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious injury or harm to employees.
Each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and
all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this program which are
applicable to his or her own actions and conduct.
Each employee shall be notified by the placing upon bulletin boards or other
places of common passage, of any application for a temporary variance from any
standard or regulation.
Each employee shall be given the opportunity to participate in any hearing
which concerns an application for a variance from a standard.
Any employee who may be adversely affected by a standard or variance issued
pursuant to this program may file a petition with the Director or City of
Jackson.
Any employee who has been exposed or is being exposed to toxic materials or
harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels in excess of that provided
for by an applicable standard shall be notified by the employer and informed of
such exposure and corrective action being taken.
Subject to regulations issued pursuant to this program, any employee or
authorized representative(s) of employees shall be given the right to request an
inspection.
Change 3, September 6, 2016 APP-B-3
No employee shall be discharged or discriminated against because such
employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any
proceedings or inspection under, or relating to, this program.
Any employee who believes he or she has been discriminated against or
discharged in violation of these sections may, within thirty (30) days after such
violation occurs, have an opportunity to appear in a hearing before Personnel
Dept. for assistance in obtaining relief or to file a complaint with the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development alleging such
discrimination.
A copy of the Occupational Safety and Health Program for the Employees of City
of Jackson is available for inspection by any employee at City Hall during
regular office hours.

Appendix III. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
PROGRAM PLAN ACCIDENT REPORTING PROCEDURES
Note: All fatalities or accidents involving the hospitalization of three (3) or more
employees shall be reported by phone to the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development within eight (8) hours.
There are six important steps required by the OSHA recordkeeping system:
1. Obtain a report on every injury/illness requiring medical treatment (other
than first aid).
2. Record each injury/illness on the OSHA Form No. 300 according to the
instructions provided.
3. Prepare a supplementary record of occupational injuries and illnesses for
recordable cases either on OSHA Form No. 301 or on worker's
compensation reports giving the same information.
4. Every year, prepare the annual summary (OSHA Form No. 300A); post
it no later than February 1, and keep it posted until April 30.
5. Retain these records for at least 5 years.
6. Complete the Survey of Occupational Injuries/Illness and mail it to Labor
Research and Statistics, when requested.
The four (4) procedures listed below are based upon the size of the work force
and relative complexity of the organization. The approximate size of the
organization for which each procedure is suggested is indicated in parenthesis
in the left hand margin at the beginning, i.e., (1-15), (16-50), (51-250), and (251
Plus), and the figures relate to the total number of employees including the
Chief Executive Officer but excluding the governing body (County Court, City
Council, Board of Directors, etc.).
(1-15) Employees shall report all accidents, injuries, or illnesses directly
to the Officer as soon as possible, but not later than twenty-four
(24) hours, of their occurrence. Such reports may be verbal or in
writing. All fatalities or accidents involving the hospitalization of
three (3) or more employees shall be reported to the Officer and/or
recordkeeper immediately, either by telephone or verbally, and will
be followed by a written report within four (4) hours after their
occurrence. The officer will insure completion of required reports
and records in accordance with § 4-208 of the basic plan.
(16-50) Employees shall report all accidents, injuries, or illnesses to their
supervisor as soon as possible, but not later than two (2) hours
after their occurrence. All fatalities or accidents involving the
Change 3, September 6, 2016 APP-B-5
hospitalization of three (3) or more employees shall be reported to
the Officer and/or recordkeeper immediately, either by telephone
or verbally, and will be followed by a written report within four (4)
hours after their occurrence. The supervisor will investigate the
accident or illness, complete an accident report, and forward the
accident report to the Director and/or recordkeeper within
twenty-four (24) hours of the time the accident or injury occurred
or the time of the first report of the illness.
(51-250) Employees shall report all accidents, injuries, or illnesses to their
supervisor as soon as possible, but nqt later than two (2) hours,
after their occurrence. The supervisor will provide the Officer
and/or recordkeeper with the name of the injured or ill employee
and a brief description of the accident or illness by telephone as
soon as possible, but not later than four (4) hours, after the
accident or injury occurred or the time of the first report of the
illness. All fatalities or accidents involving the hospitalization of
three (3) or more employees shall be reported to the Officer and/or
recordkeeper immediately, either by telephone or verbally, and wiil
be followed by a written report within four (4) hours after their
occurrence. The supervisor will then make a thorough
investigation of the accident or illness (with the assistance of the
Officer or Compliance Inspector, if necessary) and will complete a
written report on the accident or illness and forward it to the
Officer within seventy-two (72) hours after the accident, injury, or
first report of illness and will provide one (1) copy of the written
report to the recordkeeper.
(251-Plus) Employees shall report all accidents, injuries, or illnesses to their
supervisors as soon as possible, but not later than two (2) hours
after their occurrence. The supervisor will provide the
administrative head of the department with a verbal or telephone
report of the accident as soon as possible, but not later than four
(4) hours, after the accident. If the accident involves loss of
consciousness, a fatality, broken bones, severed body member, or
third degree bums, the Officer will be notified by telephone
immediately and will be given the name of the injured, a
description of the injury, and a brief description of how the
accident occurred. The supervisor or the administrative head is to
be notified of the accident within seventy-two (72) hours after the
accident occurred (four (4) hours in the event of accidents involving
a fatality or the hospitalization of three (3) or more employees).
Change 3, September 6, 2016 APP-B-6
Since an OSHA NO. 301 Form must be completed, all reports submitted in
writing to the person responsible for recordkeeping shall include the following
information as a minimum:
1. Accident location, if different from employers mailing address and state
whether accident occurred on premises owned or operated by employer.
2. Name, social security number, home address, age, sex, and occupation
(regular job title) of injured or ill employee.
3. Title of the department or division in which the injured or ill employee is
normally employed.
4. Specific description of what the employee was doing when injured.
5. Specific description of how the accident occurred.
6. A description of the injury or illness in detail and the part of the body
affected.
7. Name of the object or substance which directly injured the employee.
8. Date and time of injury or diagnosis of illness.
9. Name and address of physician, if applicable.
10. If employee was hospitalized, name and address of hospital.
11. Date of report.
NOTE: A procedure such as one of those listed above or similar information is
necessary to satisfy Item Number 6 listed under PROGRAM PLAN in Chapter
IV, Part IV of the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Plan. This
information may be submitted in flow chart form instead of in narrative form if
desired. These procedures may be modified in any way to fit local situations as
they have been prepared as a guide only.
Generally, the more simple an accident reporting procedure is, the more
effective it is. Please select the one procedure listed above, or prepare a similar
procedure or flow chart, which most nearly fits what will be the most effective
for your local situation.

ZONING RESOLUTION
MADISON COUNTY, TENNESSEE
AUTHORITY
A resolution in pursuance of the authority granted by Sections 13-401 through 13-415 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, to promote the health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare within the area designated as the Jackson Planning Regional created on March 15, 1950; to provide for the establishment of zoning districts within the defined planning region; to regulate the uses of land and the construction of buildings and other structures with a view to encouraging the most appropriate use of land; to provide for future expansion of the roadways within the planning region by regulating the location of buildings and structures, and required open spaces; to provide for a Board of Zoning Appeals; to provide methods of administration of this resolution and to prescribe penalties for the violation thereof.
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE QUARTERLY COURT OF MADISON COUNTY, TENNESSEE AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE I. TITLE
This resolution shall be known and may be cited as the "Zoning Resolution of Jackson, Tennessee Planning Region", and the map therein referred to which is identified by the title, "Zoning Map Jackson, Tennessee Planning Region and dated September, 1962" and all explanatory matters thereon are hereby adopted and made a part of this resolution.
ARTICLE II. PURPOSE
The zoning regulations and districts set forth in this resolution have been made in accordance with general planning proposals for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of the people of Jackson, Tennessee, Planning Region. They have been designed to lessen congestion, to secure safety from fires, panic, and other dangers, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding and blighting of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. They have made with reasonable consideration as to the character of each district and its suitability for particular uses and with a view of conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the region so that Jackson and Madison County, Tennessee may become a better area in which to live.
4
ARTICLE III. GENERAL PROVISIONS
For the purpose of this resolution there shall be certain general provisions which shall apply to the region as a whole. Terms and special words are defined in Article IV.
A. Zoning Affects Every Structure and Use
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved or altered unless for use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the provisions specified in this resolution for the zone district in which is located. However, this shall not be construed as authorizing the requirements of building permits or any regulation of any building or other structure, other than setback requirements from the centerline of the roadway, on lands devoted to agricultural uses. Nothing in this resolution is intended to conflict with the Airport Zoning Ordinance which shall take precedence within the area defined on the McKellar Airport Zoning Map.
1. A building permit will not be required for the erection of structures designed for the sheltering of children who are waiting for school buses, subject to the following provisions: No such structure may be constructed of masonry materials or erected on a masonry foundation; but shall follow the specifications on file with the Building Inspector. No such structure may be erected within the existing rights-of- way, or in line of vision at any intersection as provided in Article III, Section J. Any such structure must be well maintained. Excessive uncut weeds and grass, excessive litter, poor structural repair, or badly peeled or faded paint shall be cause for removal upon order of the Building Inspector unless corrected within thirty (30) days after notification. Advertising of the sponsors attached to the sides of such building shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area on each side of the structure, and shall be subject to the same standards of maintenance as the structure. No such structure shall be erected or continued except on an existing school bus route.
B. Construction Only On Lots of Record
1. A building permit shall be issued for construction only on a parcel of land which was an official lot of record at the time of passage of this resolution or which has been developed as a lot of record in an approved subdivision under the Subdivision Regulations for the Jackson Planning Region.
*2. No building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut at least one street or travel easement as herein defined for at least fifty (50) feet. However, building permits issued for lots served by travel easements shall be restricted to existing lots of record, as herein defined. This shall not be construed to apply to properties abutting a cul-de-sac type turnaround; a minimum street abutment distance of twenty-five (25) feet shall apply to cul-de-sac turnarounds, provided, however, that the minimum building line distance is provided at the building setback line.
C. Reduction in Lot Area
No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in area unless this proposed subdivision of land is approved by the Jackson Regional Planning Commission under its Subdivision Regulations.
*Revised: 4/20/92
5
D. Only one Principal Building on Any Lot
*1. Only one principal building and the customary accessory buildings may hereafter be erected on any lot. In any residential district any dwelling shall be deemed to the principal building: In the FAR zone a mobile home and a conventional single family residence may be placed on the same lot if area, side yard, and rear yard requirements of the zone can be met. If one dwelling is in back of the other, the dwelling must be separated by a distance equal to the combined depths of the front and rear yards required in the zone. Board of Zoning Appeals approval is necessary.
2. The provision that only one principal building and its customary accessory buildings may hereafter be erected on any lot is not intended to prohibit group housing, groupings of commercial buildings, or groupings of industrial buildings provided, however, that no building permit shall be issued for any such development until a site plan of the proposed development has received approval by the Jackson Regional Planning Commission.
E. Location of Accessory Buildings
Accessory buildings may be erected on any lot except as governed as follows:
1. No accessory building shall be erected in any required front or side yard. Accessory buildings shall not cover more than thirty (30) percent of any required rear yard and shall be at least five (5) feet from all lot lines and from any other building on the same lot; nor shall it be located nearer than twenty-five (25) feet to the principal building on an adjacent lot.
2. Accessory buildings where the first story is used as a garage may have a second use for residential purposes by domestic employees of the occupant of the principal building, and their immediate family, provided, that such accessory building be located no closer to the principal building than thirty (30) feet and that such accessory building shall have a side yard on each side of not less than ten (10) feet.
3. No accessory building shall exceed two (2) stories in height.
4. On any corner lot adjoining in the rear another lot which is a residence district, accessory structures within the rear yard shall conform to the side yard setback on corner lots as indicated.
F. Buildings Prohibited in Flood Plains
No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building for any residential, business, industrial, or public use which would be within the flood plain of any creek, ditch, or stream, or which is subject to periodic or occasional inundation, as determined by the Jackson Regional Planning Commission. This shall be construed to include the storage of any materials which may float and cause drainage obstructions.
*Revised: 3/16/81

63
submission of final development plans, the Planning Commission may authorize the granting of a permit for site preparation.
Any unauthorized deviation from the final site plan as approved by the Planning Commission shall constitute a violation of the building permit. In such cases where revisions would constitute a minor change in the final site plan, the Planning Director shall have the authority to authorize such changes. In all instances where a substantial change is requested or where there is any question of magnitude or consequence of the proposed revision, the final site plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval.

1. The Madison County, Tennessee, Mayor and its Legislative Body wish to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Ch. 1, Section 60.3.
2. Areas of Madison County, Tennessee are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section C. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Resolution to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Resolution is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
*Approved: 9/20/10
82
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Section D. Objectives
The objectives of this Resolution are:
1. To protect human life, health, safety and property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

Non-Residential buildings located in all A Zones may be floodproofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are built with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth in Article IV, Section B.
3. Enclosures
All new construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a Tennessee professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
96
1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

Section C. Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with Established Base Flood Elevations and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface elevation of the Base Flood Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the
98
same methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for Madison County, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
2. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section D. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
2. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section E. Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base Flood Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or other sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Article V, Sections A and B.
2. Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation data.
3. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a
99
level of at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II). All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in Article IV, Section B. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Article V, Section B.
4. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within Madison County, Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
5. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B. Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.
Section F. Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B, apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRMs, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article V, Section B.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
100
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this Resolution and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in accordance with Article IV, Section B.
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Section G. Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-99 Zones)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III, Section B, are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV and Article V shall apply.
Section H. Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within Madison County, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following provisions shall apply:
1. No encroachments including fill material or other development including structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality.
2. When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with Articles IV and V.

In order to carry out the provisions of this Section, there are hereby created and established certain zones, which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on Figures 6.4 and 6.5 in the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport Master Plan, prepared by Barge Waggoner Sumner & Cannon, Inc., and approved by the Jackson-Madison County Airport Authority in April 2005, and such
116
zones are hereby created and made a part of the Official Zoning Map for Madison County, Tennessee. A copy of which is attached for reference. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
a. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than ¾ Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone - The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width-of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
e. Conical Zone - The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
D. AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this Section to a height in excess of the application height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
a. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone - Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
b. Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone  Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each for upward beginning
117
at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
c. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than ¾ Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone  Slopes thirty-four (34) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

e. Transitional Zones - Slope seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation, which is 433 feet above, mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
f. Horizontal Zone - Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 583 feet above mean sea level.
g. Conical Zone - Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
h. Excepted Height Limitations - Nothing in this Section shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
E. USE RESTRICTIONS
a. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this Section in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport
118
and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
b. In order to regulate development and uses of land of parcels of property that are projected in the future to be exposed to high levels of noise created by aircraft landings, take-offs, or other airport operations at the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport, there are hereby created and established certain noise exposure contours, which are those areas identified to be subject to aircraft generated noise of 65 Day/Night Average Sound Level (DNL) or greater, as they apply to the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport. Such noise contours are shown on Figure 5.2 in the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport Master Plan, prepared by Barge Waggoner Sumner & Cannon, Inc., and approved by the Jackson-Madison County Airport Authority in April 2005, and such noise contours are hereby created and made a part of the Official Zoning Map for Madison County, Tennessee. A copy of which is attached for reference. The noise exposure contours are as follows:
1. 65 DNL  the area within the 65 DNL contour is exposed to significant levels of aircraft noise that renders these areas normally unacceptable for single-family residential, service commercial, and cultural and entertainment uses.
2. 70 DNL  the area within the 70 DNL contour is exposed to significant levels of aircraft that renders these areas normally unacceptable for any residential use, service commercial, and cultural and entertainment uses.
3. 75 DNL  the area within the 75 DNL contour is exposed to severe levels of aircraft noise that renders these areas clearly unacceptable for any residential, service commercial, cultural and entertainment, retail trade, and some manufacturing uses.
c. The Land Use Guidance Chart as published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is appended to this Section and shall be used by the zoning administrator to determine the procedure for all permitted uses within the designated noise exposure contour areas.
d. All uses which are classified as uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts as defined by the zoning administrator and also classified in the Land Use Guidance Chart as acceptable in the noise exposure area in which the site is located shall be uses permitted by right.
119
F. NONCONFORMING USES
a. Regulations Not Retroactive - The regulations prescribed by this Section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this Section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this Section, and is diligently prosecuted.
b. Marking and Lighting - Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary upon the recommendation of the Airport Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport.
G. PERMITS
a. Future Uses - Except as specifically provided in a, b, and c hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this Section shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with the Section.
1. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
2. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
120
3. In the areas lying within the limits of the transitional zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Section, except as set forth in D. of this Section.
b. Existing Uses - No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this Section or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
c. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed - Whenever the Airport Manager determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
d. Variances - Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Section, may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this Section. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this Section may be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport Commission for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the Board of Zoning Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. The appeal of any decision or recommendation of the Airport Manager in the administration of this Section may be
121
appealed to the Airport Board of Adjustments, as outlined in J. of this Section.
e. Obstruction Marking and Lighting - Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Section and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Zoning Appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport Commission at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
