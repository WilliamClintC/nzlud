ARTICLE 7
SIGNS
SECTION 265-701. PURPOSE
It is the intent of this section to provide specific controls and regulations for the design, construction,
installation and maintenance of signage. These sign regulations shall minimize the distraction and
obstruction of view to promote pedestrian and traffic safety, minimize the adverse effects of signage
on nearby properties, to provide an effective guide for communicating identification through
signage, and to enable fair and consistent enforcement.
SECTION 265-702. SIGN PERMITS
Signs shall be erected, placed, established, created, altered or maintained only in conformance with
the requirements of this section and any and all other ordinances and regulations relating to signs
and similar devices. Sign permits shall be required for the erection, placement, moving,
establishment, creation or alteration of all signs unless otherwise indicated in this section in
accordance with the following:
A. Applications for permits shall be made to the Zoning Officer.
B. The erection, placement, moving, establishment, creation or alteration of any permanent
sign is prohibited until a permit for such work has been issued.
C. The application for a permit shall include a dimensioned sketch or scale plan indicating the
shape, size, height and location of all signs to be erected, altered or moved; supply
evidence that the proposed sign will not create a sight obstruction; and supply such other
information as may be required by the Zoning Officer for determining whether the provisions
of this section are being met.
D. The Commissioners shall set fees by resolution for sign permits, including required bonds to
be posted, as deemed necessary.
SECTION 265-703. COMPUTATIONS
The following regulations shall control the calculation of total sign area and sign height:
A. Individual sign area shall be measured on the smallest square, triangle, rectangle, circle or
other regular geometric shape, and/or combination thereof, that encompasses the extreme
limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the
sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any
supporting bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets
regulations of this section and is clearly incidental to the display itself. Where the sign
consists of individual letters or symbols attached to a building, wall or window, the area of
the sign shall be considered to be that of the smallest regular geometric shape, or
combination of shapes, that encompasses all of the letters and symbols.
Article 7 – Signs
113
Figure 7.A
B. In
computing sign area of a double-faced sign, only one side shall be considered, provided
that:
1. Both faces are identical.
2. The two faces of the sign are at no point greater than three feet from one another.
Figure 7.B
C. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at finish

C. General standards for special exceptions. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a
special exception where the applicant shows the following:

potential of hazards and congestion, illumination and glare, restrictions to natural
light and circulation.
3. Suitability. The proposed use shall be suitable for the property in question and
shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained suitably for the
anticipated activity and population served, numbers of participating population,
frequency of use, adequacy of space and generation of traffic.

circulation of pedestrians and vehicles, off-street parking and accessibility to the
existing or proposed Township street system.
6. Conformity. The proposed use shall be in conformance with all applicable

the Zoning Officer.
B. Application for a variance shall be submitted on a form provided by the Township with
fees as set forth on the Township Fee Schedule.

findings are made where relevant in a given case:
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Ordinance in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
3. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor
be detrimental to the public welfare.
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in
issue.
D. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of the PA MPC and this
Chapter.
E. Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Zoning Hearing Board, a variance expires

authorization of the variance.

the grounds thereof. The Zoning Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Zoning Hearing
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken. An appeal shall state:
1. The name and address of the appellant;
2. The name and address of the owner of the real estate to be affected by such
proposed change or appeal;
3. A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by such proposal
change;
4. A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in question, the
improvement thereon, and the present use thereof;
5. A statement of the section of this Ordinance under which the appeal is made and
reasons why it should be granted or a statement of the section of this Ordinance
governing the situation in which the alleged erroneous ruling is being appealed
and the reasons for this appeal; and
6. A reasonably accurate description of the present improvements and the additions
or changes intended to be made under this application, indicating the size,
material and general construction thereof. In addition, there shall be attached a
plot plan of the real property to be affected, indicating the location and size of the
lot and size of improvements existing thereon and proposed to be erected
thereon.
B. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later
than thirty (30) days after any application for development, preliminary or final, has been
approved by an appropriate Township officer, agency or body if such proceeding is
designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such
approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure
of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision by the Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map pursuant to
Section 265-1017 shall preclude an appeal from the final approval except in the case
where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved preliminary
approval.
SECTION 265-1012. EFFECT OF APPEAL
In accordance with the terms of the PA MPC, the effect of appeal shall be as follows:
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
148
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 265-1008 above and during its
pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body
and all official action there under shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals,
on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When
an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and
proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing
Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to
continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the
appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case.
It shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous,
it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants
to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if
an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond
shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall
be interlocutory. An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be
interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of the court
dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate court sustains the
order of the court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon
motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals,
shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the
petitioner.
SECTION 265-1013. FEES
For each application, permit or appeal, the applicant or appellant must pay the Township a fee as
set by resolution of the Township Commissioners.
SECTION 265-1014. ERRONEOUS PERMIT
A permit or authorization issued or approved in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance is
void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such a permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken
by a board, agency or employee of the Township purporting to validate such a violation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Zoning Officer, upon determining that a permit or other
permit was issued or approved in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance shall immediately
notify the permittee, in writing, of the revocation of the permit.
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
149

administration of any provision of any land use ordinance or provisions thereof with
reference to erosion and sediment control and stormwater management insofar as the
same relate to application for development involving SALDO applications. Where such
determination relates only to this Ordinance not involving a SALDO application, the
appeal from such determination of the Zoning Officer or Township Engineer shall be to
the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to Sections 265-1008 and 265-1011.
SECTION 265-1016. ZONING ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS

2. Upon receipt of said petition and the requisite fee, the Zoning Officer shall
transmit a copy of the petition to the Planning Commission.
C. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning Commission, the

class mail, to the landowner(s) within the area being rezoned. In addition, notice of said
public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Township at points deemed
sufficient by the Township along the perimeter of the tract to notify potentially interested
residents. The affected tract or area shall be posted at least one week prior to the date
of the hearing. This notice and posting shall not apply when the rezoning constitutes a
comprehensive rezoning.
H. If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed amendment is
changed substantially or is revised to include land previously not affected by it, the
Commissioners shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to public notice. The
proposed substantial change shall be forwarded to the Township Planning Commission
and the York County Planning Commission for review and comment at least thirty (30)
days prior to the hearing.
I. The vote on the enactment by the Commissioners shall be within ninety (90) days after
the last public hearing. Within thirty (30) days after enactment, a copy of the amendment
to the Zoning Ordinance shall be forwarded to the York County Planning Commission.
SECTION 265-1017. SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS ON VALIDITY OF ORDINANCE
A. A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the validity of an
ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or
development of land in which he has an interest shall submit the challenge either:
1. To the Zoning Hearing Board under Section265-1008; or
2. To the Commissioners under Section 265-1018, together with a request for a
curative amendment.
B. Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of another by an
ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desire to challenge its validity on
substantive grounds shall first submit their challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a
decision thereon under Section 265-1008.
C. The submissions referred to in Subsections 1017.A and B above shall be governed by
the following:
1. In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging party shall make
a written request to the Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The request
shall contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the landowner desires to
challenge the validity of such ordinance and elects to proceed by curative
amendment under Section 265-1018, the application to the Commissioners shall
contain, in addition to the requirements of the written request hereof, the plans
and explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed by the
landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the challenged
ordinance or map. Such plans or other materials shall not be required to meet the
standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the
issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
151
use or development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the challenged
ordinance or map in light thereof. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the
landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting his challenge.
2. If the submission is made by the landowner to the Commissioners under
Section 265-1018, the request also shall be accompanied by an amendment or
amendments to the ordinance proposed by the landowner to cure the alleged
defects therein.
3. If the submission is made to the Commissioners, the Township Solicitor shall
represent and advise it at the hearing.
4. The Commissioners may retain an independent attorney to present the defense
of the challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to present their witnesses
on its behalf.
5. Based on the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the Commissioners
or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be, shall determine whether the
challenged ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a
challenge heard by the Commissioners is found to have merit, the
Commissioners shall proceed as provided in Section 265-1018. If a challenge
heard by the Zoning Hearing Board is found to have merit, the decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
a. The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies,
schools and other public service facilities;
b. If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon
regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in
providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of the ordinance or map;
c. The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's
soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features;
d. The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands,
wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the degree
to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources
to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and
e. The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other
land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
6. The Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be, shall
render its decision within forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of the last
hearing. If the Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be,
fails to act on the landowner's request within these time limits, a denial of the
request is deemed to have occurred on the 46thday after the close of the last
hearing.
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
152
D. The Zoning Hearing Board or the Commissioners, as the case may be, shall commence
its hearings within sixty (60) days after the request is filed unless the landowner requests
or consents to an extension of time.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the ordinance or map
is in question and shall give the place where and the times when a copy of the request,
including any plans, explanatory material or proposed amendments may be examined by
the public.
F. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
1. The Zoning Hearing Board or the Commissioners, as the case may be, fails to
commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in Subsection 265-1017;
2. The Commissioners notify the landowner that it will not adopt the curative
amendment;
3. The Commissioners adopt another curative amendment which is unacceptable to
the landowner; or
4. The Zoning Hearing Board or the Commissioners, as the case may be, fails to
act on the request forty-five (45) days after the close of the last hearing on the
request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the landowner and the
Township.
G. Where a curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of a curative
amendment application by the Commissioners pursuant to Section 265-1015 or a validity
challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to Section 265-1008 or the
court acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity
challenge, and the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years from the date of
such approval to file an application for preliminary approval pursuant to the requirements
for subdivision and land development. Within the two-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan
shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as
granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of
the preliminary plan, the provisions of Section 508(4) of the PA MPC shall apply. Where
the proposal appended to the curative amendment application or the validity challenge is
approved but does not require further application under any SALDO, the developer shall
have one year within which to file for a permit. Within the one-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of
the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge.
During these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the
purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
SECTION 265-1018. CURATIVE AMENDMENTS
A curative amendment may be initiated by either a landowner or by the Commissioners.
A. Procedure for landowner curative amendments. A landowner who desires to challenge
on substantive grounds the validity of a zoning ordinance or map or any provision
thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
153
interest may submit a curative amendment to the Commissioners with a written request
that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided as provided in
Section 265-1017.
1. The Commissioners shall commence a hearing thereon within sixty (60) days of
the request as provided in Section265-1017. The curative amendment and
challenge shall be referred to the Township and County Planning Commissions
as provided in Section265-1016 and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given
as provided in Section265-1019.
2. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section265-1007. If the
Commissioners do not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in
accordance with this subsection and a court subsequently rules that the
challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of
invalidity for the entire Zoning Ordinance and Map but only for those provisions
which specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and challenge.
3. If the Commissioners determine that a validity challenge has merit, the
Commissioners may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the alleged
defects. The Commissioners shall consider the curative amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
a. The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies,
schools and other public service facilities.
b. If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon
regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in
providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of the ordinance or map.
c. The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's
soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features.
d. The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands,
wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features; the degree
to which these are protected or destroyed; the tolerance of the resources
to development; and any adverse environmental impacts
e. The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other
land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
B. Procedure for municipal curative amendments.
1. If the Commissioners determine that this Zoning Ordinance or any portion thereof
is substantially invalid, the Commissioners shall declare, by formal action, this
Zoning Ordinance or portions hereof substantively invalid and propose to prepare
a curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within thirty (30) days
following such declaration and proposal, the Commissioners shall:
a. By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity of
the Zoning Ordinance, which may include:
Article 10 – Administration and Enforcement
154
1) References to specific uses which are either not permitted or not
permitted in sufficient quantity;
2) Reference to a class of use or uses which require revision; or
3) Reference to the entire ordinance which requires revisions.
b. Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance to correct the declared invalidity.
2. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Commissioners shall enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffirm the
validity of the Zoning Ordinance.
3. Upon the date of the declaration and proposal, the Commissioners shall not be
required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment; nor shall
the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested under
Section 265-1017 subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the
grounds identical to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution
required by this section. Upon completion of the procedures as set forth in this
section, no rights to a cure shall, from the date of declaration and proposal,
accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the
unamended Zoning Ordinance for which there has been a curative amendment
pursuant to this section.
4. The Commissioners, having utilized the procedures as set forth in this section,
may not again utilize said procedure for a thirty-six (36) month period following
the date of the enactment of a curative amendment or reaffirmation of the validity
of the Zoning Ordinance; provided, however, if after the date of declaration and
proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed upon the
Township by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania
Appellate Court decision, the Township may utilize the provisions of this section
to prepare a curative amendment to this Ordinance to fulfill said duty or
obligation.
SECTION 265-1019. PUBLICATION, ADVERTISEMENT AND AVAILABILITY OF
ORDINANCES
A. Proposed zoning ordinance amendments shall not be enacted unless notice of proposed
enactment is given in the manner set forth in this section and shall include the time and
place of the meeting at which passage will be considered and a reference to a place
within the Township where copies of the proposed amendment may be examined
without charge or obtained for charge not greater than the cost thereof. The
Commissioners shall publish the proposed amendment once in one newspaper of
general circulation in the Township not more than sixty (60) days nor less than seven

voting upon enactment, the Commissioners shall, at least ten (10) days prior to
enactment, re-advertise, in one newspaper of general circulation in the Township, a brief
