for the year up to the amount of such excess.
(2) Emergency Appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting
life, health, property or the public peace, the board of supervisors
may make emergency appropriations. Such appropriations may be
made by emergency ordinance in accordance with the provisions of

unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the board of
supervisors may by such emergency ordinance authorize the
issuance of emergency notes, which may be renewed from time to
time, but the emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal year shall
be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding
that in which the emergency appropriation was made.
(3) Reduction of Appropriations. If, at any time during the fiscal year, it
appears probable to the manager that the revenues available will
be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to
the board of supervisors without delay, indicating the estimated
amount of the deficit, any remedial action taken by him, and his
recommendations as to any other steps to be taken. The board of
supervisors shall then take such further action as it deems
necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and for that purpose it
may, by ordinance, reduce one or more appropriations.
(4) Transfer of Appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the
manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered
appropriation balance among programs within a department, office
or agency; and, upon written request by the manager, the board of

unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office
or agency to another.

forthcoming fiscal year.

specify, each department, office or agency shall submit work programs
for the ensuing fiscal year showing the requested allotments of its
appropriation by periods within the year. The manager shall review and
authorize such allotments with or without revision as early as possible
in the fiscal year. He may revise such allotments during the year if he
deems it desirable and shall revise them to accord with any
supplemental, emergency, reduced or transferred appropriations made
pursuant to section 707(d).
(b) Payment of Funds. No payment of any fund of the township shall be
made unless provided for in the budget and specifically approved by the
board of supervisors; provided, however, that payroll and utility

discretion provide for a special election at an earlier date within the
prescribed period. Copies of the proposed or referred ordinance shall

the persons whose signatures appear on the sheet are registered electors
of the township, that they signed with full knowledge of the contents of the
petition, and that their residences are correctly given.
A recall petition shall be tendered for filing to the board of elections having
jurisdiction over elections in the township. No signature shall be counted
as valid which is dated more than sixty (60) days prior to the date the
petition is tendered for filing. Upon tender to the board of elections, the
petition shall be available for examination by any interested person. Within
fifteen (15) days after tender of the petition, the board of elections shall
have authority to pass upon the validity of the petition and the validity
and number of signatures required thereon. The decision of the board of
elections shall be subject to immediate review on appeal to the Court of
Common Pleas.

As soon as the board having jurisdiction over elections in the township
has accepted a recall petition for filing and determined its validity and
sufficiency, the chairman of the board shall notify the incumbent named in
the petition that the petition has been filed. Upon receipt of such notice the
incumbent may resign from his office and thereupon the recall proceedings
shall terminate.
§ 1004. Recall Elections.
If the incumbent against whom a recall petition is directed does not resign
from his office within ten (10) days after notice of the filing of such petition
shall have been given to him, the board having jurisdiction over elections in
the township shall arrange a recall election. If a regular or special election
§ 1001 HOME RULE CHARTER § 1004
Ch:31
is to be held not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days
after the ten (10) days have expired, the recall question shall be placed
before the electors at such an election. Otherwise, a special recall election
shall be fixed by such board for a date not earlier than thirty (30) days nor
later than ninety (90) days after the ten days have expired. The incumbent
against whom a recall petition is directed may resign at any time prior to
the recall election and thereupon the election shall not be held.
The following question shall be presented to each elector in a recall
election: "Shall (name of officer) be recalled and removed from the office of
(name of office)?"
The above question shall appear as to every officer whose recall is to be
voted upon and provision shall be made for the elector to vote "Yes" or "No"
on the question.
If a majority of the registered electors who vote on the question at a
recall election shall vote "Yes," the incumbent shall be deemed recalled and
removed from office; but if a majority of such registered electors shall vote
"No," he shall remain in office.
Should the result of such election be affirmative, the date of the removal
and vacancy in the office shall be seven (7) days subsequent to the date
when the results of election are certified by the board having jurisdiction
thereon, unless such date is further postponed by order of court.
§ 1005. Disqualification for Office.
No person who has been removed from an elective office by a recall
election, or who has resigned from such an elective officer after a recall
petition directed to him has been filed, shall be eligible for election or
appointment to any office of the township within two years after his removal
or resignation.
§ 1006. Limitations.
No recall petition shall be filed against any incumbent of an elective office
within the first year or the last nine months of the terms of his office or
within nine months after an unsuccessful recall election against him, but
an officer who has been reelected for a successive term shall be subject to
recall also during the first year of such term.

No. 491, which enables the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to take all action necessary to effectuate the coverage of their
employees and officers under the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System;

Whereas, it is the opinion of the Board of Supervisors of Kingston Township,
County of Luzerne that the extension of this Social Security System will be
of great benefit not only to the employees of the Township of Kingston, but
to the Township of Kingston by attracting to it and enabling it to retain the
best of personnel and thus increasing the efficiency of its government; and
it is deemed that the payment by the Township of its portion of the cost of
said system is a payment for the purpose of the Township;

the Social Security System and that the benefits of old age and survivors
insurance be extended to its employees and officers; and

of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the "state agency" charged with the
administration of the enabling Act, the Plan and Agreement required under
the provisions of Section 6 of said enabling Act and the Social Security Act,
to extend coverage to the employees and officers of this Township, and to
do all other things necessary to that end; and
Be it further resolved that the Secretary-Treasurer be, and he is hereby
authorized to make all required payments into the Contribution Fund
established by Section 7 of said enabling Act and to establish such system
of payroll deductions from salaries of officers and employees as may be
necessary to their coverage under said Old Age and Survivors Insurance
System; and
Be it further resolved that the Board of Supervisors of Kingston Township
hereby appropriate from the proper fund or funds of the said Township the
amounts necessary to pay;
Be it further resolved that the proper officials of Kingston Township, County
of Luzerne, do all things in accordance with the provisions contained in the
§ 1220 HOME RULE CHARTER § 1220
Ch:107
Plan and Agreement necessary to the continued implementation of said Old

UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the Code adopted the International
Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
reference, as the construction standard applicable with the State floodplain
construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the applicable floodplain management regulations of
Kingston Township set forth in this Chapter. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3),
(e)(4) or (e)(5) and within this Chapter is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage
(or repetitive loss when a repetitive loss provision is used) regardless of
the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include
any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
A.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this Chapter must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause
removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the
Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

§ 501. Designation of Floodplain Areas. [Ord. 2012-5, 10/10/2012,
§ 5.01]
§ 502. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas. [Ord. 2012-5, 10/10/2012, § 5.02]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
1. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Kingston Township
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated November 2, 2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Kingston Township and
declared to be a part of this Chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District identified as a floodway in the FIS, which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the FIS.
(1) Within any floodway area, encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall not be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no
floodway has been delineated.
(1) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
§ 501 HOME RULE CHARTER § 502
Ch:229
§ 503. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. 2012-5, 10/10/2012,
§ 5.03]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Kingston
Township Board of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a
qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 504. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 2012-5, 10/10/2012 § 5.04]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Kingston Township Floodplain
Administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the base flood elevation than
one foot at any point.
(2) No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any
watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no onepercent-
annual-chance flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or
other acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject
to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one foot and three feet. In Zones AO and
AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around
and away from structures on slopes.

be made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the
activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development shall be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
B. Technical or scientific data shall be submitted by Kingston
Township to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) as soon as
practicable but within six months of any new construction,
development, or other activity resulting in changes in the BFE. The
situations when an LOMR or a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) is required are:
(1) Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations
within the floodway; or
(2) Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and AE without a
designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than one
foot in the base flood elevation; or
(3) Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited
to installing culverts and bridges).
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed
within any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the provisions contained in this Chapter and any
other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.

OUTDOOR SOLID FUEL FURNACES
§ 701. Purpose. [Ord. 2008-1, 3/25/2008, § 1]
§ 702. Definitions. [Ord. 2008-1, 3/25/2008, § 2]
The following words or phrases, as the same are used herein or as the
same appear in the context hereof, unless otherwise indicated, shall have
the following meaning(s) ascribed to them in this part:
APPLIANCE  An outdoor solid fuel furnace and all appurtenances thereto,
including, but not limited to, all equipment and all components necessary
to and used in connection with the installation, use and maintenance of the
outdoor solid fuel furnace.
1. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Article 1,
Section 27, provides in pertinent part, that "the people shall have a
right to clean air"; and
2. In response to the enactment by the Congress of the United States of
the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq., and in recognition of the
mandate of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the
Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has enacted the Air
Pollution Control Act, Act 1992-95, § 14, as amended, 35 P.S. § 4001 et
seq., which, in Section 4012 thereof, provides that a Township may
enact an ordinance(s) in respect to air pollution, so long as the
provisions of such ordinance(s) will not be less stringent than the
provisions of the "Air Pollution Control Act"; and
3. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Kingston has considered
with care certain publications, studies, reports, and advisories
prepared by international, national and state research and regulatory
agencies and organizations inquiring into the effects and impact of the
types of fuel used in and the scale and duration of the emissions
produced by outdoor solid fuel furnaces. Upon that basis, the Board of
Supervisors, while recognizing the economical alternatives to
conventional heating systems provided by outdoor solid fuel furnaces,
has determined that such appliances may create uncontrolled offensive
emissions of smoke, fumes, and odors into the ambient air, which can be
potentially detrimental to the health and safety of the residents of the
Township and can deprive neighboring residents of the rightful use and
enjoyment of their property. Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors of
the Township of Kingston, upon the enactment of this part, does hereby
establish and impose various restrictions upon the installation,
maintenance, use, and operation of outdoor solid fuel furnaces within
the Township of Kingston, so that such appliances do not create a
private or public nuisance and, further, for the purpose of securing and
promoting the health, comfort, convenience, safety and welfare of the
person and property of the residents of the Township.
§ 701 HOME RULE CHARTER § 702
Ch:265
EXISTING APPLIANCE  An appliance that has been installed, constructed,
used and maintained on or before the effective date of this part.

solid fuels to produce heat or energy by the distribution, through pipes,
of a fluid heated in the device and used as the primary or secondary or
supplementary heating system, which provides heat for interior space and/
or domestic water within a structure located on residential premises and
is not located within the structure to be heated or to be provided with hot
water.
PERSON  Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association,
institution, governmental entity or agency, enterprise or any other legal
entity whatsoever, which is recognized by law as the subject of rights and
duties.

lots under one ownership are used, the exterior property line so grouped
shall be used is determining a setback.
STRUCTURE  A building constructed and used for human habitation,
housing of farm animals, or storage of equipment or materials of whatever

The Board of Supervisors of the Township finds that:
§ 102. Purpose. [Ord. 2015-1, 6/10/2015]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Township by minimizing the damages described in § 101A of this
chapter through provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.

regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter, "nonstructural
BMPs or measures" refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas "structural BMPs or measures" are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian
or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured
devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to
project sites.
CAPTURE  The process of collecting runoff to be managed by a
stormwater BMP.
CHANNEL EROSION  The widening, deepening, and headward cutting of

requirements of this chapter.
D. For redevelopment projects in which the existing site is disturbed,
the entire proposed site is subject to the plan preparation and
§ 301 KINGSTON CODE § 301
Ch:400
§ 302. Exemptions. [Ord. 2015-1, 6/10/2015]
approval requirements of this chapter. Existing conditions are
considered to be the existing site prior to disturbance, and 20%
of the existing impervious area must be considered as meadow in
good condition for all stormwater calculations. For redevelopment
projects in which the existing site is already controlled by a
stormwater management facility, the requirement to consider 20%
of existing impervious area as meadow is waived, provided the
existing facility meets the water quality, volume, and peak rate
standards and criteria of this chapter.
14. Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater.
15. All regulated activities shall include measures to:
A. Protect health, safety, and property.
B. Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing
measures outlined in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual) to:
(1) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded
areas.
(2) Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
(3) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
(4) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this commonwealth.
(5) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
C. To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low-impact development practices described in the BMP Manual.
16. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under Title
25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law,41 and the
Stormwater Management Act.42
17. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual.

4. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 301, Subsections 1 through 17.
1. Areas not covered by a Stormwater Management District Map
contained in Appendix F.1 of this chapter:43 Post-development
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates
for the one- through one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. If it is
shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the postdevelopment
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one- through
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of
this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide
additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
2. Areas covered by a Stormwater Management District Map contained in
Appendix F.1 of the this chapter: For the one- through one-hundred-year
storms, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved Stormwater Management District Maps. For any
areas not shown on the Stormwater Management District Maps, the
post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates.
1. General. Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management District
Map (Appendix F.144) and § 303 of this chapter.
2. District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspections
at the Township office. A copy of the official map at a reduced scale is
included in Appendix F.1. The exact location of the stormwater
management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part
of the SWM site plan.

subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the
predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea as indicated in § 303
and on the Stormwater Management District Maps in Appendix F.1.
4. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site, although not detained, must be considered when
determining allowable peak runoff rates at the project site's discharge
point(s). On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey
off-site flows through the development site.
1. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
2. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to
store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency
spillway to handle flow up to and including the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
conditions. The height of embankment must be set as to
provide a minimum one foot of freeboard above the maximum pool
elevation computed when the facility functions for the one-hundredyear
post-development inflow. Should any stormwater management
facility require a dam safety permit under 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 105
(DEP Chapter 105), the facility shall be designed in accordance with
DEP Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of DEP Chapter 105
concerning dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger
than a one-hundred-year event.
3. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges,
outfalls, or stream enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as
directed in DEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced from
time to time by DEP), shall be designed in accordance with DEP
Chapter 105 and will require a permit from DEP. Any other drainage
conveyance facility that does not fall under DEP Chapter 105
regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage
structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point
along the top of the roadway. Roadway crossings located within
designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a onehundred-
year design storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard
measured below the lowest point along the top of roadway. Any facility
that constitutes a dam as defined in DEP Chapter 105 regulations may
require a permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility located
within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design
standards and permit submission requirements.
4. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall
under DEP Chapter 105 regulations must be able to convey, without
§ 304 KINGSTON CODE § 305
Ch:404
§ 306. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 2015-1, 6/10/2015]
damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the twentyfive-
year design storm. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from
stormwater management facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be
designed to convey the design flow to or from that structure. Roadway
crossings located within designated floodplain areas must be able to
convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm. Any facility
located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements.
5. Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from a
twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging inlets, where
appropriate.
6. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels,
and at all points of discharge.
7. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
8. Storage facilities, to the greatest extent possible and at the discretion
of the Township Engineer, shall completely drain both the volume
control and rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24
hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
9. Storage facilities shall incorporate features to maximize the length of
the flow path and increase the travel time through the facility.
10. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The Township shall reserve
the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or
continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the
watershed.
1. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally
accepted calculation techniques that are based on the NRCS soil cover
complex method. Table III-2 summarizes acceptable computation
methods. It is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design
professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of each
method for a particular site. The Township may approve the use of the
Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that
contain less than 200 acres.
2. The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of
the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S. Department of
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center,
§ 305 HOME RULE CHARTER § 306
Ch:405
Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA's Atlas 14 can be accessed at:
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
3. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land, including disturbed areas, shall be considered as
"meadow" in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates
a lower curve number or Rational C value (i.e., forest).
4. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Outlet structures for stormwater
management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance
standards of this chapter using any generally accepted hydraulic
analysis technique or method.
5. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed
using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The
Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique which shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
6. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions. If the
designer can substantiate through actual physical calibration that more
appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration values should be utilized
at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon
review and recommendations of the Township Engineer. Calibration
shall require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the particular site in
question.

1. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102, Erosion
and Sediment Control rules and regulations; Part I, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources; and in accordance with the Luzerne
Conservation District and the standards and specifications of the
Township of Kingston.
2. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be or are recommended to be applied where
infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
A. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
B. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
§ 306 HOME RULE CHARTER § 308
Ch:407
in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For all
regulated activities that require submission of a formal SWM site plan, both
the Design Storm Method and the Simplified Method shall be calculated;
the larger control volume based on the two calculations shall be controlled.
Subsection C below provides requirements for mined, Karst, or other
geologically limiting areas where infiltration shall not occur.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow or its equivalent.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions.
B. When Design Storm Method CG-1 guidelines are not used, the
Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) has been modified to
accommodate two inches of permanently removed runoff volume. This
method (provided below) is independent of site conditions and should
be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. For new impervious
surfaces:
(1) The first two inches of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this commonwealth). Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(2) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the 0.5 inch of the permanently
removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(3) Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to the
Township Engineer's discretion, shall be designed to drain the
permanently removed runoff volume in a period no less than 24
hours and no greater than 72 hours.
(4) Runoff volume in excess of two inches shall be safely conveyed to
existing stormwater collection systems or streams, in the direction
of the existing drainage course.
(5) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 303, Stormwater
Management, Peak Rate Controls.
§ 308 KINGSTON CODE § 308
Ch:408
C. Before infiltration is proposed on a site, site conditions shall be
evaluated by a qualified design professional through subsurface
investigation and testing to determine if site conditions are suitable to
support proposed infiltration facilities to manage runoff. If it is
determined that infiltration is not feasible due to physical constraints of
the site, or will adversely impact the environment as demonstrated by
the presence of acid mine drainage, sinkhole formation, or other
serious environmental issues, then the above volume controls must be
achieved through surface BMP mitigation. Reference the BMP Manual
for alternative mitigation measures that do not require infiltration.

the Executive Director in compliance with applicable state or
federal regulations.
N. Any substance which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
3. When a local limit has been developed to implement any of the above
prohibited waste standards, compliance with the local limit shall be
deemed compliance with the prohibited waste standard unless the user
has reason to know that the discharge, notwithstanding the local limit,
has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass-through.
1. The WVSA will develop local limits as set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.5 and
such other local limits as it deems advisable for the safe, efficient and
reliable operation of the sewer system and the WVSA facilities. Local

to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or in any pollutant-specific
limitations developed by the WVSA or the commonwealth; provided,
however, that dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with
certain of the prohibitions set forth in § 311, e.g., the pH and temperature
prohibitions, if such dilution is authorized by an industrial wastewater
discharge permit.
§ 318. Prohibition on Discharge of Stormwater and Cooling Water.
[Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 2.8]
No user shall discharge any stormwater, including but not limited to
basement or foundation drainage, or any uncontaminated cooling water into
the sanitary sewer system, provided that such discharges are allowable into
those portions of the sewer system (if any) that are designated combined
sewers by the municipality. When, upon application to do so, the direct

Ch:459
§ 342. Flow Measurement. [Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 4.12]
The volume of flow used in computing loadings or surcharges shall be based
on the total water consumption data as obtained from the permittee or the
records of the local water utility. If a user has a substantial portion of the
metered water that does not reach the sanitary sewer system, the user may,
at its own expense, and with approval from the Executive Director, install
a separate flow-metering device to measure the actual discharge into the
sanitary system. If the actual flow to the sanitary system is measured, the
equipment used for measurement of the flow must be maintained in proper
working order at all times. A separate written record of calibration and
maintenance must be kept for the flow-metering device and made readily
available for inspection by the WVSA.
§ 343. WVSA Monitoring. [Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 4.13]
The WVSA may conduct periodic monitoring of the following types:
§ 344. User Self-Monitoring. [Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 4.14]
A. Scheduled or unscheduled sampling and inspections of the user's
facilities and records shall be conducted at all Class I users at least
once each year.
B. Additional sampling or inspections may be conducted whenever the
WVSA determines a need to investigate the discharges of a user.
C. Demand sampling and inspections may be performed in response to a
complaint or an unusual or emergency situation, such as when the
WVSA determines a change in the normal discharge characteristics of
the user's wastewater flow, if a violation was detected during sampling
or self-monitoring under § 343, if problems that may be attributable to
the user's discharge occur in the sewer system or WVSA facilities, or if
a complaint or report of noncompliance is received by the municipality
or WVSA.
D. If the WVSA performs routine compliance sampling of a user in lieu of
the self-monitoring provisions of § 343, the WVSA shall be subject to the
repeat sampling requirement of § 343B in the case that a violation of
any pretreatment standard or requirement is detected.
E. All discharge sampling and analyses conducted by WVSA shall be in
accordance with the sampling and analysis requirements for user selfmonitoring
in § 344.
A. Sampling; resampling.
(1) Users subject to an industrial wastewater discharge permit may be
required, at the user's expense, to conduct sampling and analyses
of their wastewater on a periodic schedule as established by the
permit. Should the results of said analyses indicate a violation of
any provision of the user's permit, the user must:

(a) The WVSA conducts monthly sampling; or
(b) The WVSA conducted compliance sampling between the time
when the initial sample was collected and when the laboratory
results were received.
B. All wastewater sampling shall be representative of the indirect
discharge. Unless otherwise specified in the wastewater discharge
permit (and documented in the WSVA files), all samples shall be
collected as flow-proportional composite samples over a twenty-fourhour
period, except for samples for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds, which shall be
obtained as grab samples. Grab samples for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides may be obtained as multiple grab samples and composited in
the field or the laboratory before analysis; grab samples for oil and
grease and volatile organic compounds may be obtained as multiple
grab samples and composited in the laboratory before analysis. For
constituents required to be collected as grab samples, the permit shall
specify the number of grab samples required for each representative
analysis.
C. Unless otherwise specified in a permit, all sampling, sample
preservation, and laboratory analyses shall be according to the
requirements in 40 CFR Part 136.
1. All users subject to an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall be

discharge originates, and the authorization is submitted to the
WVSA.
2. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation
or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to federal
pretreatment regulations and/or this Part, or who falsifies, tampers
with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under federal pretreatment regulations or this Part, shall be
subject to the civil and criminal penalties as set forth in 40 CFR
403.12(n) governing false statements, representations or certifications
in reports required under the Act, as well as 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904, as
amended, and other applicable state law.
1. The WVSA may require to be provided and operated, at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems
from which a discharge flows into the sewer system. The monitoring
facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
municipality may, upon application by the user and when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
allow the facility be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
2. There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
monitoring facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the user.
3. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be provided in accordance with the WVSA's requirements
and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written
notification of approval of the plans by the WVSA or within such other
time as may be authorized by WVSA.
1. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and inspections
shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without
restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the WVSA that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
2. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
§ 347 KINGSTON CODE § 349
Ch:464
§ 350. Accidental Discharges. [Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 4.20]
be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this Part, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit, and the pretreatment program; provided,
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the
state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics shall not be recognized as confidential information.
3. Information accepted by the WVSA as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by the WVSA until and unless a tenday
notification is given to the user. Information accepted as
confidential by the WVSA shall be made available to governmental
agencies. If requested by the user, the EPA and PADEP will treat the
submitted information as confidential to the extent provided in 40 CFR
Part 2.
A. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials and to
mitigate, reduce, and contain any such discharge shall be provided and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the WVSA for review and shall be approved by the WVSA before
construction of the facility. No user who commences discharge of
industrial wastewater to the sanitary sewer system after the effective
date of this Part shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until accidental discharge protection, containment and
countermeasure procedures have been approved by the WVSA. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this Part.
B. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user
to immediately telephone and notify the WVSA of the incident. The
notification shall include location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions being taken.
C. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Executive Director a detailed report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notifications shall not relieve the user
of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the WVSA, its facilities, or any other person or
property, nor shall notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Part or other
applicable law. Failure to notify the Executive Director of an accidental
discharge shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this Part.

Ch:465
§ 351. Emergency Discharges. [Ord. 2012-4, 8/8/2012, § 4.21]
In the case of a nondomestic user that, for reasons of emergency
maintenance, equipment failure, or other similar unforeseen event beyond
the user's reasonable control, must discharge prohibited, high-strength, or
other wastewater of unusual strength, character or volume, the user may
apply to the Executive Director for an emergency discharge permit. The
Executive Director may issue such a permit, on terms and conditions as he
deems appropriate, upon his review of the information provided and in his
sole discretion. No discharge of the unusual wastewater may be made until
and unless an emergency discharge permit has been issued. An emergency
discharge permit shall not be issued for longer than 30 days and may be
renewed only after a new application has been made.
D. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
an accidental discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who
may be present in an area where an accidental discharge may occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure as well as the
containment and countermeasures developed by the user to mitigate
and control any such discharge.

suspension shall be a violation of this Part and subject to the penalties
provided herein. In the case of a suspension, the permit shall be
reinstated upon a showing that the user has corrected the condition for
which the suspension was imposed. In the case of a revocation, the user
may only receive a new permit by going through the application process
as stated in § 335 of this Part.
1. The municipality and/or the WVSA may suspend the wastewater

steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance or
obstruction of the sewer connection from the user's property, to prevent
or minimize damage to the sewer system or the WVSA facilities or
endangerment to any individuals. The WVSA or the municipality shall
reinstate the wastewater treatment service only upon satisfactory proof
of elimination of the noncomplying discharge. All costs associated with
the severance and/or reconnection of a sewer shall be incurred by the
user.
1. Any user who is found to have violated any provision of this Part, the
rules and regulations of the WVSA, as amended, or any regulations or

2. The municipality recognizes that the WVSA has independent civil
penalty authority under the provisions of the Publicly Owned Treatment
Works Penalty Law (Act 9 of 1992, 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.). Any violation

penalties provided thereunder. Should WVSA choose to access a civil
penalty under its independent authority against a user who violates any
provision of this Part, the municipality shall cooperate to the extent
necessary to aid WVSA in such an action.
3. In addition to the civil penalties provided herein, the municipality and/
or the WVSA may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court
reporters' fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at
law against the person found to have violated this Part, the WVSA rules

becomes visible on the road the sign is primarily intended
to serve. If a sign is intended to be seen by more than one
roadway, the road with the lower posted speed limit shall
be used for determining message duration.
(b) Multiply the road's posted speed limit (mph) by 5,280 and
then divide by 3,600 to obtain the speed limit in feet per
second.
(c) Divide the visibility distance by the speed limit (feet per
second).
(d) Add an additional 10% of this number to the total.
(e) The resulting amount of time is the minimum permitted
message duration, except where this value is less than
eight seconds, in which case the minimum message
duration shall be no less than eight seconds.
B. Types of Illumination: Where permitted, illumination may be:
(1) External: Externally illuminated signs, where permitted, are
subject to the following regulations:

GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
§ 501. Application. [Ord. 86-5, 1/14/1987]
The following principles, standards and requirements will be applied by
the Board of Supervisors and Planning Commission to evaluating plans
for proposed subdivision or land developments. The standards and
requirements outlined herein shall be considered minimum standards and
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare. Where literal compliance with the standards herein
specified is clearly impractical, the Board of Supervisors may modify or
adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while
securing substantial conformance with the objectives of this chapter.
§ 502. Land Requirements. [Ord. 86-5, 1/14/1987]
§ 503. Street System. [Ord. 86-5, 1/14/1987; as amended by Ord.
90-9, 12/12/1990]
A. Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
B. Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life,
safety, health, or property, shall not be subdivided or developed until
such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards
against such hazards are provided for in the Subdivision or Land
Development Plan. Land included as having unsuitable characteristics
would be the following:
1. Land subject to flooding or which has a high ground water table.
2. Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding
condition upon other land.
3. Land subject to subsidence.
4. Land subject to underground fires.
5. Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 10%.
6. Land which, because of topography or means of access, is
considered hazardous by the Board of Supervisors.
7. Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
C. Proposed subdivisions of land developments shall be coordinated with
existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may
develop harmoniously.
D. Proposed land uses shall conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance.
§ 501 HOME RULE CHARTER § 503
Ch:613
A. Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or parts
thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township of
Kingston and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed streets in
adjoining subdivisions or land developments.
B. Proposed streets shall further conform to such county and state road
and highway plans as have been prepared, adopted or filed as
prescribed by law.
C. Streets shall be related to the topography so as to produce usable lots
and acceptable grades.
D. Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivisions or land development and to adjacent unsubdivided
territory unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is
not feasible. Streets giving such access shall be improved to the limits
of the subdivision or land development and shall be improved to
Township specifications. Reserve strips and land-locked areas shall not
be created.
E. Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design. Local
access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic
and, where possible, arterial streets shall be designed for use by
through traffic.
F. Where the proposed subdivision or land development contains or is
adjacent to an existing or proposed arterial street or a highway
designated as a Limited Access Highway by the appropriate highway
authorities, provisions shall be made for marginal access streets at a
distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the land between the
arterial street or Limited Access Highway and the marginal access
streets. The Board of Supervisors may also require rear service areas,
double frontage lots, or such other treatment as will provide protection
for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with
primary streets, and separation of local and through traffic.
G. Half or partial streets will not be permitted in new subdivisions or land
developments except where essential to reasonable subdivision or
development of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and
standards of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured.
H. Wherever a tract to be subdivided or developed borders an existing half
or partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan.
I. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited. [Amended by Ord. No. 2018-3,
12/12/2018]
J. New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets, shall
be forbidden.

K. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets
in a proposed subdivision or land development shall be made to provide
for the proper projection of streets into the unsubdivided land.
L. Street names shall be coordinated with existing or platted street names,
and if a new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or
platted street, it shall bear the same name as the existing or platted
street.
M. No street shall be laid out or opened which extends to or crosses any
boundary between the Township of Kingston and any other municipality
except with the specific approval of the Board of Supervisors and upon
such condition as the Board of Supervisors may impose. If the street is
proposed to serve a commercial area, an industrial area or a residential
area of 50 dwelling units or more, located in another municipality, the
street shall not be approved unless the area is also served by a street in
the other municipality and unless the relevant traffic facilities of the
Township of Kingston are adequate to handle the anticipated volume.
N. All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective
lengths except where otherwise required by the Board of Supervisors
pursuant to Subsection B3 of § 504.
O. Guide rail shall be installed when all of the following conditions exist:
[Amended by Ord. No. 2018-3, 12/12/2018]
1. The embankment slope exceeds 2 1/2:1.
2. The top of slope is within five feet of the right-of-way line.
3. The vertical height of the embankment, measured from the edge of
pave to the bottom.
P. Where guide rail is required, it shall be installed in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Publication 408.
A. Street Classification.
1. Three functional classifications are hereby established for the
streets and roads in Township of Kingston: [Amended by Ord. No.
2018-3, 12/12/2018]
(a) Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intracounty or intermunicipal traffic of substantial volumes
where the average trip lengths are usually five miles or
greater. Generally, these highways should accommodate
operating speeds of 35 to 55 miles per hour. (See: DWG No.
DD-04.57)
§ 503 HOME RULE CHARTER § 504
Ch:615
(b) Collector. This classification is intended to include those
highways which connect local access highways to arterial
highways. They may serve intracounty and intra-Township
traffic. They may serve as traffic corridors connecting
residential areas with industrial, shopping and other service.
They may penetrate residential areas. Generally, these
highways will accommodate operating speeds of 35 miles per
hour. (See: DWG No. DD-03.58)
(c) Local Access. This classification is intended to include streets
and roads that provide direct access to abutting land and
connections to higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will
be low and travel distances generally short. These streets and
roads should be designed for operating speeds of 25 miles per
hour or under. (See: DWG No. DD-02.59)
B. Right-of-Way Widths.
1. Minimum widths for each type of public street shall be as follows:
Type of Street
Right-of-Way
Width Cartway Width
Arterial 80'  120' 46'
Collector 60' 34'
Local Access 50' 25'
2. Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing public
street or road having a right-of-way width less than would be
required if said street or road were created under this chapter,
sufficient additional width for right-of-way shall be provided and
dedicated to meet the foregoing standards.
3. Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the
Board of Supervisors to promote public safety and convenience
when special conditions require it and to provide parking space in
areas of intensive use.
C. Cul-de-sac Streets.
1. Cul-de-sac streets, whether permanent or temporary, shall be
provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum
radius to the edge of the finished street or curbline of not less than
40 feet paved radius and a fifty-foot radius right-of-way. The cul-desac
shall have a paved diameter of 80 feet. The right-of-way

diameter shall be 100 feet. (See: DWG No. DD-01.60) [Amended by
Ord. No. 2018-3, 12/12/2018]
2. Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line
and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried
to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of
the street into the adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is
extended, the overage created by the turnaround outside the
boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the
property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.
3. Commercial and industrial culs-de-sac shall be reviewed for
adequacy by the Township Engineer. His recommendations will be
given to the Board of Supervisors who shall have final authority in
this matter.
4. Permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be kept to a minimum and shall
not exceed 600 feet in length.
C.1. Public vehicular access required.
1. Public vehicular access ("access") to subdivision and/or land
development shall be provided by determining the number of
access points that shall be required, as follows:
(a) For subdivisions and/or land developments with 12 or fewer
lots, at least one point of access to the roadway shall be
provided.
(b) For subdivisions and/or land developments with between 13
and 45 lots, at least two points of access to the roadway shall
be provided.
(c) For subdivisions and/or land developments with 46 or more
lots, at least three points of access to the roadway shall be
provided.
2. A divided entrance shall equate to one point of access.
3. The Kingston Township Board of Supervisors may approve waivers
in respect to the requirements of this Subsection C1, when
additional public vehicular access points are precluded in the
following circumstances:
(a) If the only additional access points available would require
crossing floodplains, steep slopes, or other similar natural
features; or
60.Editor's Note: The drawings are on file in the Township offices.
§ 504 HOME RULE CHARTER § 504
Ch:617
(b) When the existing development pattern precludes additional
access points and fewer units than would otherwise be allowed
would be out of character with the surrounding development.
(c) When permitted by PennDOT or Luzerne County Road and
Bridge. [Added by Ord. No. 2018-3, 12/12/2018]
D. Street Alignment.
1. Whenever street lines are deflected, connection shall be made by

"A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," latest
edition by American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials, but in no case greater than 12%.
3. Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1% and
shall provide proper sight distances as specified herein above.
4. Positive drainage shall be established with the construction of all
infrastructures improvements responsible for conveying
stormwater runoff to a stormwater collection facility (i.e., storm
inlets, catch basins, etc.), including but not limited to paved inverts
along curblines, paved gutters, swales and ditches, regardless of
type, and maintained until such time Kingston Township or another
responsible party accepts ownership of the same. [Added by Ord.

5. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall
be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection of a
local street and a collector or arterial street shall be at least 25
feet. [Amended by Ord. No. 2018-3, 12/12/2018]
6. There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections clear
sight triangles of 75 feet in all directions measured along the
center line from the point of intersection. Nothing which obstructs
the vision of a motorist shall be permitted in this area.
7. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an
intersection exceeds 7%, a leveling area shall be provided having a

they will be creating concentrated flows to receiving facilities not
intended for this purpose. Level spreaders and multiple discharges
shall be provided where direct access to natural waterways is not
available.
2. All roof leaders from proposed structures on lots less than 2 1/2
acres in size shall discharge to subsurface drainage fields and all
roof leaders shall not discharge directly onto proposed streets or
proposed street right-of-way. Drainage fields shall provide a
minimum of 200 CF of storage for each 1,500 SF of horizontal roof
area. Protective covenants shall be provided to insure compliance.
Overflow pipes and cleanouts shall be provided on all subsurface
systems. A typical drainage field design shall be shown on the
grading and drainage plan.
A. Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from
buildings and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools.
Minimum 2% slopes away from structures shall be required.
B. Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourse. Where
drainage swales are used to deliver surface waters away from
buildings, their grade shall not be less than 1% nor more than 4%. The
swales shall be sodded, planted or lined as required. A Grading and
§ 506 HOME RULE CHARTER § 507
Ch:625

two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following
conditions:
1. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope of steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and
a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified
hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or damage to
property.
2. A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound
engineering standards for which plans are submitted to the
Township Engineer for review and approval is provided.
D. No final grading shall be permitted which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical except under one or
more of the following conditions:
1. The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or be hazardous to adjoining property,
streets, alley, or buildings.
2. A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted
to and approved by the Township Engineer.
3. A wall is constructed to support the face of the fill.
E. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three feet from

G. The United States Postal Service and Luzerne County 911 Center shall
assign house numbers to each lot within a subdivision. [Added by Ord.
No. 2018-3, 12/12/2018]
A. The length, width, shape, and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Township
of Kingston, the topography of the land being subdivided, and the
requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
B. Unless the topography of the land being subdivided or the existing
pattern of development in the immediately adjacent area shall be
otherwise than herein required, the following minimum standards for
the design and size of blocks and lots shall prevail:
1. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 500
feet in length.
2. Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots
bordering an arterial or collector street are used, or where due to
the contour of the land, or the necessary layout of the subdivision,
there is insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such
two tier design.
3. Crosswalks or interior pedestrian walks shall be required in blocks
exceeding 1,000 feet in length to provide for pedestrian circulation
or access to community facilities. Such walks shall be paved for
width of not less than four feet, shall be located in easements not
less than 10 feet in width, and shall, insofar as possible, be located
in the center of any such block.
4. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use
requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers shall be provided along with safe and
convenient limited access to the street system. Space for off-street
loading shall also be provided with limited access to the street
system. Extension of streets, railroad access right-of-way, and

5. Lot lines intersecting street lines shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to street lines.
6. Lots shall, in general, front on a street which has already been
dedicated to the Township of Kingston, or which the subdivider or
developer proposes to dedicate to the Township of Kingston in
connection with approval of the final plan. In commercial or
industrial subdivisions or land developments where access is
proposed to be provided by private streets within the subdivision or
land development, this requirement may be waived by the Board of
Supervisors.
7. The Township of Kingston shall assign house numbers to each lot
within a subdivision.
8. Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the Township Zoning
Ordinance.
9. Remnants of land, smaller than required for a lot, shall not be
permitted within any subdivision. Such remnants shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use
if acceptable to the Board of Supervisors.
10. Double frontage lots are prohibited except in accordance with
§ 508B2 above.
A. It is the policy of this Township of Kingston that all subdivided lands
shall have immediate access to a public street. Because of unique
property configuration and location, this Township of Kingston
recognizes the need for limited exceptions to the foregoing general
policy.
B. No subdivision will be approved on a private street or road if more than
two lots already front on such street or road or if after subdivision more
than two lots will front on such private street or road.
A. In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the
degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan
has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic
to the site, shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject
to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
existing natural features, such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded
areas and watercourse.
B. Open Space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or

preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work,"
which will confine excavation, earth moving procedures and other
changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure preservation and
prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space.
C. Tree Preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within
the proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
D. Topsoil Preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills
have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes
10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater.
E. Landscaping. For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall
be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open
space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and
natural barriers.
F. Buffer Planting Requirements. Buffer yard requirements should be as
specified in the Township Zoning Ordinance.
G. Preserved Landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to
preserve the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where
such preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable
to required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer
screening, the plan may be received in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
H. Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not
be permitted. The planting of any trees within the private property of
each residential lot shall be at the discretion of the property owner or
developer.
I. Watercourse Protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural
drainage. Such easement shall be in addition to the open space
required in § 510B.

§ 510 HOME RULE CHARTER § 512
Ch:629
A. General Purpose.
1. The Board of Supervisors finds that the minimization of erosion and
control of sedimentation in connection with land development and
subdivision are in the public interest, affecting public health, safety
and welfare, and therefore those regulations governing erosion
control and sedimentation control are necessary for the Township
of Kingston.
2. No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other
vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Township Engineer and/or
Luzerne County Soil and Water Conservation District, or there has
been a determination by the above entities that such plans are not
necessary.
3. No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(1) there has been an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan
approved by the Board of Supervisors that provides for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation consistent with this section, and an
improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited
with the Township of Kingston in the form of an escrow guarantee
which will ensure installation and completion of the required
improvements; or (2) there has been a determination by the Board
of Supervisors that a plan for minimizing erosion and
sedimentation is not necessary.
4. Where not specified in this chapter, measures used to control
erosion and reduce sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the
standards and specifications of the Luzerne County Soil and Water
Conservation District. The Township Engineer, or other officials as
designated, shall ensure compliance with the appropriate
specifications, copies of which are available from the Soil and
Water Conservation District.
B. Performance Principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
1. Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall be
done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
2. Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
3. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected,
and supplemented.
§ 512 KINGSTON CODE § 512
Ch:630
4. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
5. Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
6. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
7. The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
8. Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be structurally retarded.
9. Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps, or similar measures.
C. Grading for Erosion and Other Environmental Controls. In order to
provide suitable sites for building and other uses, improve surface
drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
1. Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition as one of the first items of work done on a
subdivision or development. The wearing surface shall be installed
in accordance with § 504G and as approved in the final plan.
Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills, by
installation of temporary or permanent drainage across or above
these areas.
2. Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
3. Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable protection
against erosion during periods of flooding.
4. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
5. Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams. Provisions will be made for the installation of temporary
or permanent culverts or bridges.
D. Responsibility.
1. Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective
responsibility of the land developer and subdivider, and of the
contractor, person, corporation and other entity causing such
§ 512 HOME RULE CHARTER § 512
Ch:631
§ 513. Floodplain Area Regulations. [Ord. 86-5, 1/14/1987]
sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage
systems and watercourses and to repair any damage at his expense
as quickly as possible.
2. Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the
responsibility of the land developer or subdivider.
3. It is the responsibility of any developer or subdivider, and any
person, corporation, or other entity doing any act on or across a
communal stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or
right-of-way, to maintain as nearly as possible in its present state
the stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during
the pendency of the activity to return it to its original or equal
condition after such activity is completed.
4. The subdivider or land developer shall provide and install, at his
expense, in accordance with Township requirements, all drainage
and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent)
shown on the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
E. Compliance with Regulations and Procedures.
1. The Board of Supervisors, in their consideration of all preliminary
plans of subdivision and land development, shall condition its
approval upon the execution of erosion and sediment control
measures as contained in § 512B and C hereof.
2. The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with standards and
specifications of the Luzerne County Soil and Conservation District.
F. Stream Channel Construction. Stream channel construction on
watersheds with drainage areas in excess of 1/2 square mile, or in those
cases where downstream hazards exist, will conform to criteria
established by the Pennsylvania DEP. [Amended by Ord. No. 2018-3,
12/12/2018]
A. Purpose. The specific purposes of these special provisions are:
1. To regulate the subdivision or development of land within any
designated floodplain area in order to promote the general health,
welfare, and safety of the community.
2. To require that each subdivision lot in flood prone areas be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and that
public facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to
preclude flood damage at the time of initial construction.
3. To prevent individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flooding by prohibiting the improper subdivision or
§ 512 KINGSTON CODE § 513
Ch:632
development of unprotected lands within the designated floodplain
districts.
B. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. To the extent that this imposes
greater requirements or more complete disclosure than any other
provisions of this chapter, in any respect, or to the extent that the
provisions of this section are more restrictive than such other
provisions, it shall control such other provisions of this chapter.
C. Disclaimer of Municipal Liability. The grant of a permit or approval of a
plan for any proposed subdivision or land development to be located

E. Design Standards and Improvements in Designated Floodplain Areas.
1. General.
(a) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in any designated floodplain area may be platted
for development with the provision that the developer
construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
(b) No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will
individually or collectively, increase the 100-year flood
elevation more than one foot at any point.
§ 513 KINGSTON CODE § 513
Ch:634
(c) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway
area in a floodplain area if the lowest floor (including
basement) is elevated to the regulatory flood elevation. If fill is
used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend
laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of
the proposed structures and access shall meet the
requirements of § 513E3 hereinbelow.
(d) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for such structures or buildings outside the floodway in a
floodplain area shall be protected as provided for in § 513E1(c)
above. However, the Board of Supervisors may allow the
subdivision or development of areas or sites for commercial
and industrial uses at an elevation below the regulatory flood
elevation if the developer otherwise protects the area to that
height or assures that the buildings or structures will be floodproofed
to the regulatory flood elevation.
(e) If the Board of Supervisors determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development
proceed consistent with this determination.
(f) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself
and the Board of Supervisors determines that additional
controls are required to insure safe development, they may
require the developer to improve appropriate deed restrictions
on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every
deed and noted on every recorded plat.
2. Drainage Facilities.
(a) Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow
of surface waters without damage to persons or property. The
system shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and
provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-site
waste disposal sites.
(b) Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Board of
Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may require a primary
underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a
secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less
frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local,
county and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be
designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto
adjacent properties.
3. Streets and Driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets
and driveways shall not be more than the one foot below the
§ 513 HOME RULE CHARTER § 513
Ch:635
regulatory flood elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and
driveways to determine compliance with this requirement and as
required by other provisions of this Subdivision Ordinance shall be
submitted with the final plan. Drainage openings shall be sufficient
to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
4. Sewer Facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
designated floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be flood
proofed up to the regulatory flood elevation.
5. Water Facilities. All water systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be flood proofed up
to the regulatory flood elevation.
6. Other Utilities and Facilities.
(a) All other public or private utilities and facilities, including gas
and electric, shall be elevated or flood proofed up to the
regulatory flood elevation.

have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this chapter have been installed in
accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this chapter, the
developer may deposit with the Township financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common
amenities including basins and other related drainage facilities,
§ 610 KINGSTON CODE § 612
Ch:642
recreational facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen
plantings which may be required.
2. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Board of Supervisors, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of
a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
written extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors; such
extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in
writing at the request of the developer.
3. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this section.
4. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
commonwealth.
5. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
6. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
7. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
§ 612 HOME RULE CHARTER § 612
Ch:643
Township, upon the recommendation of the Township engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant
or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the 3rd engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a 3rd
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
8. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
9. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plats by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future section or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
10. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time, of
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall
be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors, and the Board of
Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within
which to allow the Township engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board
of Supervisors that such portion of the work upon the improvements
has been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such
certification the Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by
the Township engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be
deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The Board
of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated
cost of the aforesaid improvements.
11. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Board of Supervisors
may require the posting of financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
§ 612 KINGSTON CODE § 612
Ch:644
§ 613. Release from Improvement Bond. [Ord. 1989-6, 11/8/1989]
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from
the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be
of the same type as otherwise required in this section with regard
to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
12. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
13. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement
of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted
upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement
of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such
building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond
the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
1. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township
engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of
such notice, direct and authorize the Township engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Township engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report in writing, with the Board of Supervisors, and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days
after receipt by the Township engineer of the aforesaid authorization
from the Board of Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall
indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or
in part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be
§ 612 HOME RULE CHARTER § 613
Ch:645
approved or shall be rejected by the Township engineer, said report
shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
2. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail of the action of said Board of Supervisors with relation thereto.
3. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be
released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or
other security agreement.
4. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
5. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the
Township engineer.
6. Where herein reference is made to the Township engineer, he shall be
as a consultant thereto.
7. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection or
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of

professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing
date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the
Township is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such
engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Township engineer
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Township or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
E. The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Township shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but

§ 205. Exempt Parties. [Ord. 2007-4, 7/11/2007]
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this Part. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall not,
however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.
The actual consideration for or actual monetary worth of any executory
agreement for the construction of buildings, structures or other
permanent improvements to real estate between the grantor and other
persons existing before the transfer and not removed thereby or
between the grantor, the agent or principal of the grantor of a related
corporation, association or partnership and the grantee existing before

1. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction, or any part hereof, a
tax at the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by such

such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.
2. The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds
whereon the date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the
signature of the collecting agent shall be set forth.
3. It is the intent of this Part that the entire burden of the tax imposed on a
person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations imposed by the laws
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; so that if any other political
subdivision or school district shall have imposed or hereafter shall
impose such tax on the same person or transfer, then the tax levied by
the Township of Kingston under the authority of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall, during the time such duplication
of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the
rate, and such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the
part of the Township of Kingston; provided, however, that the Township
of Kingston and any other political subdivision which impose such tax
on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted by law.
4. If, for any reason, the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected, as
provided in § 212 hereof.

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
E. A transfer or division in kind, for no or nominal actual
consideration, of property passed by testate or intestate succession
and held by co-tenants; however, if any of the parties take shares

excess.
F. A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,

and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania realty transfer tax statement of value
may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this Part.

ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change

2. Procedure to Claim Exemption.
A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event that the political subdivision utilizes a tax
collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate
to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a
copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the political subdivision for the year prior to the
fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or except as
required by Subsection 2B, the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.

calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000, in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection 2C.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection 2B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event that the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
§ 403 HOME RULE CHARTER § 403
Ch:677

shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.

length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by the DCED.

person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer with a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.

payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 404,
Subsection 2, of this Part 4 and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this Part 4.

person; and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:

her principal office or is principally employed;
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;

the use of any public road or street of the Township, or the impairment
of the use or maintenance of the public road or street, any tree, shrub,
brush, and vegetation growing or being within the right-of-way of any
Township road or street. Such declaration by the Board of Supervisors must
be based upon clear evidence that such tree, shrub, brush, and vegetation,
or any part thereof, growing or being in the right-of-way of the public way
constitutes a menace to public travel or, by reason of any cause whatever,
may become an imminent source of danger to the public.
§ 102. Notice to Property Owner and Possible Township Action.

within the right-of-way of a Township road or street and which the Board
of Supervisors has found to constitute a hazardous or dangerous condition
to the use of the Township road or street or which impairs the use or
maintenance of the public road or street, that the property owner must
remove the tree, shrub, brush, and vegetation constituting such menace to
public travel, or which is a source of danger to the public or causes an
impairment to the use or maintenance of the public road or street, and
it must be removed by the owner of abutting property from said right-ofway
or the public way to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, or
its designees, at the sole expense of the abutting property owner within
30 days from the receipt of such notice. Upon the failure of the abutting
property owner to remove the dangerous tree, shrub, brush, and vegetation
within the time designated in such written notice, the Township may
contract with a private tree or shrub removal company, as an independent
contractor, for the removal by it of the dangerous tree, shrub, brush, and

Township may commence civil legal proceedings for the collection from
the abutting property owner of all lawful costs for the removal of the
tree, shrub, brush, and vegetation, or the Township may impose upon the
property of the abutting property owner a municipal claim and lien for all
costs incurred by the Township in the removal of the dangerous tree, shrub,
brush, and vegetation from the Township road right-of-way, pursuant to the

date of this chapter may be continued, even though such use does not
conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of a more restrictive classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has
been changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. The nonconforming
use of a building may be extended throughout those parts thereof which
were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
of this chapter. No nonconforming building or structure shall be extended,
or enlarged except when authorized by the Zoning Hearing Board which
may permit one enlargement or extension up to 25% of the floor area of the
structure as it existed at the time of passage of this chapter.
Whenever the use of a building shall become nonconforming through a

with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When damage is
less than 60% of its reproduction value, a nonconforming building may be
repaired or reconstructed, and used as before the time of damage, provided
such repairs or reconstruction are completed within one year of the date of
such damage.

involving any principal building or structure existing on the effective
date of this chapter may be continued; provided, however, that no such
nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended
either on the same or adjoining property. If such nonconforming use of
land or any portion thereof is discontinued or changed, any future use
of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
4. Dwellings on Sub-Standard Lots. The Zoning Officer may issue a
building permit for a single-family dwelling for a substandard lot only
after the Zoning Hearing Board grants such variances on lot and
building requirements, in cases of physical hardship, so as not to create
any condition detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare.

1. Submission of Plats. The owner of a tract of land zoned for industrial
uses shall submit to the Planning Commission for its review a plan for
the use and development of such tract of land. It shall then be the duty
of the Planning Commission to investigate and ascertain whether the
proposed activity complies with all of the provisions of this Part which
pertain to I-1 Districts. The Commission may employ experts in specific
fields as needed, and as funds are available, to determine whether a
proposed use meets the required performance standards.
2. Referral and Authorization. A report of its findings shall be furnished by
the Commission to the Zoning Hearing Board. The Commission may
suggest disapproval, recommend the plan as submitted, or may modify,
alter, adjust or amend the plan before recommendation, and in
recommending it, may propose the prescribing of other conditions. The
report of the Planning Commission to the Zoning Hearing Board shall
§ 508 HOME RULE CHARTER § 509
Ch:779
be in writing, and shall include a finding as to whether the proposed
use is consistent with the applicable provisions and requirements of the
Zoning Chapter. If the Board finds that the proposed use is consistent
with the purpose of the Zoning Chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare, it may direct the proper official to authorize
a permit.
3. Performance Standards. All industrial uses must conform to the
following performance standards:
A. Smoke: The emission of grey smoke at a density greater than No. 1
on the Ringlemann chart published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines
(Power's micro-Ringlemann Chart, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co.,
1954, may be used) shall not be permitted except grey smoke of a
shade not darker than No. 2 may be emitted for not more than four
minutes. These provisions, applicable to grey smoke, shall also
apply to visible smoke of a different color but with equivalent
apparent opacity.
B. Odor: No emission of unpleasant gases or other odorous matter
shall be permitted in such quantities as to be offensive outside the
lot lines of the tract. Any process which may involve the creation or
emission of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard
system, so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard
system should fail. There is hereby established as a guide in
determining such quantities of offensive odors Table 3 (Odor
Thresholds) in Chapter 5, "Air Pollution Abatement Manual",
copyright 1951, by Manufacturing Chemists Association, Inc.,
Washington, D.C. Where said publication gives a range of figures a
simple average of these shall be used.
C. Toxic Gases: The emission of gases or fumes injurious to persons or
property beyond the lot lines occupied by the use is prohibited.
(Table 1, Industrial Hygiene Standards), Maximum Allowable
Concentration, Chapter 5, of the Air Pollution Abatement Manual
furnishes a list of toxic pollutants.
D. Glare and Heat: Glare and heat from are welding, acetylene torch
cutting or similar processes shall be performed so as not to
produce glare which is visible, or objectionable heat, beyond the
property line of the lot on which the operation is located. Direct
glare from incandescent exposed lights shall not be visible from
adjoining streets or properties.
E. Sewage: No discharge is permitted at any point in any private
sewage disposal system or stream or into the ground, of any
materials in such a way or of such nature or temperature as could
contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the emission of
dangerous objectionable elements, except in accordance with the
standards as approved by water pollution control boards of
appropriate agencies of the State Department of Environmental
§ 509 KINGSTON CODE § 509
Ch:780
Resources. Furthermore, no accumulation of solid wastes
conducive to the breeding of rodents or insects shall be permitted.
F. Vibration: Any use creating intense earthshaking vibration shall be
set back as far as possible from the lot lines on all sides, and, in no
case shall any such vibration be perceptible along any lot line.
4. Permitted Use. Communications antennas mounted on an existing
public utility transmission tower, communication tower, building or
other structure, and related communications equipment buildings,

elements associated with the landscape plan.
6. Application for Final Approval.
A. An application for final approval may be for all the land included in
a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative
approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall be made to
the Planning Commission and within the time or times specified
herein. The application shall include any drawings, specifications,
covenants, easements, performance bond and such other
requirements as may be specified hereby, as well as any conditions
set forth in the official written communication at the time of
tentative approval. A public hearing on an application for final
approval of the development plan, or part thereof, shall not be
required provided the development plan, or the part thereof,
submitted for final approval, is in compliance with the development
plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified
conditions attached thereto.
B. In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by this chapter, and the official
written communication of tentative approval, the Township shall,
within 30 days of such filing, grant such development plan final
approval.
§ 511 KINGSTON CODE § 511
Ch:792
C. In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the Board of
Supervisors may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 30
days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise
the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice
the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public
interest. In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(1) Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected, or
(2) File a written request with the Board of Supervisors that it hold
a public hearing on his application for final approval. If the
landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he may
do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for
final approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development
plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the
landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the
hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed by law for public hearings
on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the
conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Supervisors shall by
official written communication either grant final approval to
the development plan or deny final approval. The grant or
denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in cases
arising under this section, be in the form and contain the
findings required for an application for tentative approval set
forth in this chapter.
D. A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the Board of
Supervisors and shall be filed of record forthwith in the office of the
recorder of deeds before any development shall take place in
accordance therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development
plan the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to
the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion within a reasonable time of said planned residential
development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has
been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said
development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be
made except with the consent of the landowner.
E. In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such
plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall
so notify the Board of Supervisors in writing; or, in the event the
§ 511 HOME RULE CHARTER § 511
Ch:793
landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the planned
residential development within such reasonable period of time as is
fixed hereby after final approval has been granted, no development
or further development shall take place on the property included in
the development plan until after the said property is resubdivided
and is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to the Borough
Zoning Ordinance in the manner prescribed for such amendments
in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
7. Mylar of Approved Final Plan. Within a maximum of three weeks
following the date of final approval by the Planning Commission of the
final development plan, the applicant shall submit an eighteen-inch by
twenty-four-inch reproducible mylar of the approved final development
plan to the Planning Commission who, at the expense of the developer,
shall record said final plan in the office of the Recorder of Deeds. The
mylar shall contain the following information:
A. Graphic representation of the exact location of all buildings and
accessory structures.
B. Land use characteristics in table form containing the following
information:
(1) Gross project area in terms of acres.
(2) Net project area in terms of acres.
(3) Approved density for the project in terms of lot area/D.U.
(4) Approved usable open space for the project in terms of square
feet of open space/D.U.
(5) Total number of parking spaces.
(6) Total number of dwelling units in the project.
(7) Number and type of residential units in the project.
C. Types and square footage of floor spaces of all nonresidential uses
provided:
(1) Graphic representation of all public easements and legal
descriptions thereof, who the easement is conveyed to, the
purpose of such easement, and any conditions relating to the
use of the easement.
D. Legal description of the gross project area.
E. All public and private streets, roads and alleys included in the
project shall be shown by their bearings, widths and names. All
streets, roads or alleys, not dedicated to public use, shall be
marked "private" and named. All curves, portions of streets, roads
or alleys shall be defined by curve data including points of
§ 511 KINGSTON CODE § 511
Ch:794
curvature, points of tangency, points of compound curvature, radii
of curves, central angles and length and bearing of its long chord.
F. In the event streets in the planned residential development are to
be dedicated, a statement shall appear on the mylar that the streets
shown on it are dedicated to the use of the public.
G. The Planning Commission shall issue a certificate certifying the
final approval of the planned residential development, and the
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors and Chairman of the
Planning Commission shall place their signature on such certificate
which shall appear on the mylar. In the event said mylar is not
submitted three weeks following the date of final approval, the
Building Official shall not issue any building permits for the
development or phase of a particular development until said mylar
is received.
H. In the event the planned unit development is to be submitted for
final approval in stages, the applicant shall submit reproducible
Mylars for each stage of the development containing the
information required above.
8. Control of the Planned Residential Development after Final Approval.
A. After the certificate of approval has been stamped on the
reproducible mylar and other prints of plans and signed by
appropriate Township officials, the use of land and the
construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or
structures within the planned residential development will be
governed by the approved and recorded final development plan
rather than by other provisions of this Zoning Chapter except the
minor land use and engineering changes permitted by this section.
B. After the certificate of final approval has been issued and the final
plan recorded, no changes may be made in the approved final
development plan except upon application to the appropriate
agency under the procedures provided below:
(1) Major Land Use Changes. Changes which alter the concept or
intent of the planned residential development including
changes in the approved public street or private drive
construction standards, increases in density, decreases in
proposed open space, changes in sizes of public and/or private
sewer or water lines, other than service connections, resulting
in less capacity, changes in the location of and types of
nonresidential uses approved by the Planning Commission,
change in the alignment of any street, drive, parking area or
water or sewer line in excess of 25 feet, change in the location
of any public easement, change in the proportion of housing
types by not more than 15% of the approved dwelling unit
count, a violation of any specific condition set forth by the
Planning Commission and any changes in the final governing
§ 511 HOME RULE CHARTER § 511
Ch:795
agreements, provisions or covenants. All such changes may
be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan
and supporting data, following the preliminary approval steps
and subsequent amendment of the final planned residential
development plan.
(2) Minor Land Use Changes. The following minor changes to the
approved final plan may be authorized by the Planning
Commission upon written request by the developer and upon
submission of detailed plans demonstrating the requested
change:
(a) Decrease in density.
(b) Increases in open space.
(c) Changes in the proportion of housing unit types by less
than 15% of the approved dwelling unit count.
(d) Increases in acreage of the planned residential
development providing that the acreage under
consideration is 10% or less of the gross site area, in which
the increase can only be used for open space, accessory
buildings or parking.
(e) A density increase of not more than 10% of the approved
dwelling unit total, providing that the overall lot area
requirement per dwelling unit of the district is not
exceeded.
(3) Minor Engineering Changes. The following minor engineering
changes to the approved engineering plans may be authorized
by the Township Engineer as required only upon written
request by the developer and submission of detailed
engineering plans demonstrating the requested change:
(a) Changes in road alignment and parking lot location by 25
feet or less.
(b) Changes in the alignment of storm and sanitary sewers
and water lines by 25 feet or less.
(c) Increases in the approved capacity of storm and sanitary
sewers and water lines.
In the event a situation occurs where it is not clear
whether a modification constitutes a major or minor
change, the responsibility to make such determination
shall be jointly vested with the Chairman of the Kingston
Township Planning Commission, and the Township
Engineer.

Ch:796
§ 512. Conservation Subdivision. [Ord. 6/11/1975A; as added by
Ord. 2003-4, 5/14/2003, § 2]
(4) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given
final approval shall be so certified without delay by the
Planning Commission and shall be filed of record forthwith in
the office of the recorder of deeds before any development
shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon filing record of
the development plan the zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall
cease to apply thereto. Pending completion within a reasonable
time of said planned residential development or of that part
thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no
modification of the provisions of said development plan, or part
thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the
consent of the landowner.
(5) In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is
given final approval and thereafter the landowner shall
abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been finally
approved, and shall so notify the governing body in writing; or
in the event the landowner shall fail to commence and carry
out the planned residential development within such
reasonable period of time as may be fixed by the Board of
Supervisors after final approval has been granted, no
development or further development shall take place on the
property included in the development plan until after the said
property is resubdivided and is reclassified by enactment of an
amendment to the municipal zoning chapter.
1. Purposes. To provide for protection of natural and historic features and
resources; to conserve open lands by setting them aside from
development; to minimize disturbance of natural or cultural features
(such as mature woodlands, streams, hedgerows and tree lines, critical
wildlife habitats, historic buildings and fieldstone walls); to preserve
scenic views and elements of the Township's rural character; to create
neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities in
the form of neighborhood open space and with a strong neighborhood
identity; to provide for active and passive recreational use by residents;
and to provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of
services and infrastructures, including the opportunity to reduce length
of roads, utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential
development.
2. Definitions.
BUILDABLE LAND or ADJUSTED TRACT ACREAGE  The net area of
a tract remaining after wetlands, steep slopes of over 25%, soils subject
to slumping and all existing or proposed road and aboveground utility
rights-of-way or easements have been subtracted. In any tract zoned
A-1, the dwelling yield is computed by dividing buildable land by 2.5.
§ 511 HOME RULE CHARTER § 512
Ch:797
The dwelling yield represents the number of dwellings that could be
placed on the tract with a 2 1/2 acre minimum lot size.[Amended by
Ord. No. 2018-4, 12/12/2018]
3. Conservation Easement. If a duly recorded, permanent conservation
easement is obtained for at least 50% of the buildable land in a tract to
be developed as a conservation subdivision, then a number of dwellings
equal to the dwelling yield plus 50% (and rounded if necessary to the
next higher number) is permitted in the tract. The open spaces retained
under the conservation easement are known as greenway lands and are
to be left for the common enjoyment of all residents of the development.
Greenway lands may be commonly owned by the residents through a
homeowners' association, or they may be owned by a land trust, an
individual landowner, the Township or a combination of the above; they
are typically managed by either a land trust or a homeowners'
association. Each parcel of the greenway land must be at least three
acres. The length-to-width ratio of each parcel cannot exceed 4:1. The
layout of the greenway lands must be approved by the Planning
Commission; this approval should not be denied without reason.
4. Sensitive Area Disturbance. The proposed design shall strictly minimize
disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas, such as wetlands, lands
within the one-hundred-year floodplain, lands having slopes in excess of
25% or rock outcroppings. Demonstration by the applicant that these
features will be protected by the proposed development shall be
prerequisite to approval of the plan.
5. Uses Permitted on Greenway Lands. The following uses are permitted
in greenway land areas.
A. Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example,
woodland, fallow field or managed meadow).
B. Neighborhood open spaces uses such as village greens, commons,
picnic areas, community gardens, trails and similar low-impact
passive recreational uses. The clearing of woodland habitat shall
generally be prohibited, except as necessary to create trails or
recreation facilities or placing houses. Specifically excluded are
motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges and other uses similar in
character and potential impact as determined by the Board of
Supervisors.
C. Active noncommercial relations areas, such as playing fields,
playgrounds, courts and bikeways, provided such areas do not
consume more than half of the minimum required greenway land or
five acres, whichever is less. Playing fields, playgrounds and courts
shall not be located within 100 feet of abutting properties.
D. Water supply and sewage disposal systems and stormwater
detention areas designed, landscaped and available for use as an
integral part of the greenway lands.
§ 512 KINGSTON CODE § 512
Ch:798
E. Easements for drainage, access, sewer or water lines or other
public purposes.
F. Underground utility rights-of-way. Aboveground utility and street
rights-of-way may traverse conservation areas but shall not count
toward the minimum required greenway land.
6. Lot and Building Requirements. In a conservation subdivision, the
principal building, accessory buildings and other land uses shall be
located so as to comply with the following requirements:
Principal Building Present Proposed
Minimum lot 2 1/2 acres 3/4 acres
Minimum lot width at
building line
400 feet 125 feet
Minimum front yard 100 feet 50 feet
Minimum side yard, interior 50 feet 25 feet
Minimum side yard, street 40 feet 20 feet
Minimum rear yard 50 feet 25 feet
Minimum percent of lot
coverage
20% 30%
Accessory Buildings
Minimum Setback from Lot
Line
Front 40 feet 20 feet
Rear 30 feet 15 feet
Side Same as principal building
The majority of house lots should abut the greenway lands in order
to provide direct views and access. Furthermore, to permit safe and
convenient pedestrian (as well as maintenance) access to the
greenway lands from each lot not abutting greenway lands, each
neighborhood shall provide one centrally located access point per 15
lots a minimum of 20 feet in width.
7. Buffer for Adjacent Public Parkland. Where the proposed development
adjoins public parkland, a natural greenway buffer at least 150 feet
deep shall be provided within the development along its common
boundary with the parkland, within which no new structures shall be
constructed, nor shall any clearing of trees or understory growth be
permitted. Where this buffer is unwooded, the Board may require
vegetative screening to be planted, or that it be managed to encourage
natural forest succession through "no-mow" policies and the periodic
removal of invasive alien plant and tree species.
8. Ownership of Greenway Lands.
§ 512 HOME RULE CHARTER § 512
Ch:799
A. All greenway land shall be permanently restricted from future
subdivision and development by a conservation easement.
B. The following options for ownership may be used:
(1) Homeowners' Association. The applicant shall provide the
Township a description of the organization of the proposed
association, including its bylaws and all documents governing
ownership, maintenance and use restrictions for common
facilities; membership in the association will be automatic for
all purchasers of dwelling units and their successors in title.
(2) Conservation Organization (such as a land trust). The owner
may transfer fee simple title of the open space or easements on
the open space to a private nonprofit conservation organization
provided that (i) the conservation organization is acceptable to
the Township and is a bona fide conservation organization
intended to exist indefinitely; (ii) the conveyance contains
appropriate provisions proper reverter or retransfer in the
event that the organization becomes unwillingly or unable to
continue carrying out its functions.
(3) Private landowner.
(4) The Township, if, at the time of the initial development the
Township wishes to assume ownership, and under the
conditions that there is no cost of acquisition to the Township
and the Township agrees to and has access to maintain such
facilities.
9. Maintenance of Greenway Lands.
A. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Board of Supervisors, the cost
and responsibility of maintaining common facilities and greenway
land as well as property taxes and any liability insurance on the
greenway lands shall be borne by the property owner, homeowners'
association or conservation organization. Funds adequate for
maintenance for at least one year must be maintained on an
ongoing basis. A conservation organization may require an
endowment from the developer to fund maintenance.
B. The applicant shall, at the time of preliminary plan submissions,
provide a plan for maintenance of greenway lands and operation of
common facilities in accordance with the following requirements.
(1) The plan shall define ownership.
(2) The plan shall establish necessary regular and periodic
operation and maintenance responsibilities for the various
kinds of open space (i.e., lawns, playing fields, meadow,
woodlands, etc.).
§ 512 KINGSTON CODE § 512
Ch:800
(3) The plan shall estimate staffing needs, insurance requirements
and associated costs, and define the means for funding the
maintenance of the greenway land and operation of any
common facilities on an ongoing basis. Such funding plans
shall include the means for funding long-term capital
improvements as well as regular yearly operating and
maintenance costs.
(4) At the Township's discretion, the applicant may be required to
escrow sufficient funds for the maintenance and operation
costs of common facilities for up to one year.
(5) Any changes to the maintenance plan shall be approved by the
Board of Supervisors.
C. In the event that the organization established to maintain the
greenway lands and the common facilities, or any successor
organization thereto, fails to maintain all or any portion thereof in
reasonable order and condition, the Township may assume
responsibility for maintenance, in which case any escrow funds
may be forfeited and any permits may be revoked or suspended. In
this case, the Township may enter the premises and take corrective
action, including extended maintenance. The costs of such
corrective action may be charged to the owner of the greenway
lands. Such costs shall become a lien on said premises.
10. Guidelines for Preparing a Conservation Subdivision. An existing
features site analysis program drawn to scale and locating and
analyzing a site's special features is required for all proposed
conservation subdivisions. This plan provides the basis for the design
process for greenway lands, house locations, street alignments and lot
lines. A sketch plan, which can be shown on an overlay sheet on the
existing features site analysis plan, is required to indicate tentative
placements of the above aspects of the design. With these tentative
plans in hand, the Planning Commission should conduct an on-site
walkabout with the applicant and may use the services of a consultant
with expertise in the design of conservation subdivisions. These plans
developed by the applicant should use the following four-step design
process:
A. Identify primary conservation lands (wetlands, floodplains, slopes
over 25% and soils susceptible to slumping). In addition to the
primary conservation areas, at least 50% of the remaining land
shall be designated as a secondary conservation area. Both primary
and secondary conservation areas shall be permanently protected
by a conservation easement. Secondary conservation lands
typically include, but are not limited to, mature woodlands, other
woodlands, hedgerows, aquifer recharge areas, significant wildlife
habitats, prime farmland, other fields and historic, archeological
and cultural features. Such potential secondary conservation lands
must be identified as to type on the existing features site analysis
§ 512 HOME RULE CHARTER § 512
Ch:801
plan. The applicant shall prioritize the secondary conservation
lands in the tract in terms of their highest to least suitabilities for
inclusion in the proposed greenway lands. At the on-site walkabout
the Planning Commission should provide guidance to the applicant
regarding the tentative location of the secondary conservation
areas, potential house locations and street alignments.
B. Locate House Sites. House sites should generally not be located
closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas nor within 50
feet of secondary conservation areas.
C. Lay Out Streets and Lots. Align proposed streets to provide
vehicular access to houses while minimizing adverse impacts on
conservation areas. Wetland crossings and streets traversing
existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly discouraged.
D. Draw in lot lines.

3. Conditions Imposed Upon the Use of Land for the Purposes Provided for
in this Section Following Conditional Use Approval and Land
Development Approval.
A. Conditions.
(1) The operator, its successors and assigns, shall be liable for the
full and complete repair and restoration of all damages of
whatever nature to all Township roads directly caused by truck
§ 603 KINGSTON CODE § 603
Ch:810
hauling from the oil and gas drill site in excess of any usual
and customary damage attributable to normal and general
vehicular use. Notwithstanding the provisions contained
herein relating to an excess maintenance agreement and the
bonding of the operator's performance thereof, should the
operator, its successors and assigns, fail to repair and restore
fully and completely such road repair and restoration of
damages to Township roads attributable to the drilling process,
the Township reserves the right to proceed against the
operator, its successors and assigns, by the commencement of
an action in law or equity seeking payment of the entire cost of
such repair and restoration of road damage, including but not
limited to all costs of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees.
(2) The operator shall disclose the proposed routes of all trucks
and other heavy equipment to be utilized for hauling to and
from the oil and gas drill site and the estimated weights of
those trucks and/or heavy equipment associated with the
drilling process. The Township reserves the right to designate
alternate routes in the event that the operator's proposed
routes are determined by the Township Engineer to be
inadequate, unsafe, or overly disruptive to normal vehicular
traffic.
(3) Before the commencement of any drilling operations, including
but not limited to the construction of the well site, the
Township Engineer and the operator shall conduct an on-site
inspection of all roads to be utilized for truck hauling to and
from the oil and gas drill site. Upon the basis of the inspection,
the Township Engineer and the operator shall prepare a
detailed report documenting the existing structural condition
of the road. Photographs and videotapes will be taken to
substantiate the report. Copies of the inspection report,
photographs, and/or videotapes will be made available to the
operator and the Township.
(4) The operator shall plan or design all proposed hauling routes
to minimize the use and impact of such truck hauling upon
Township roads wherever feasible.
(5) The operator shall produce evidence satisfactory to the
Township Engineer that all intersections along proposed
hauling routes provide a sufficient turning radius for trucks to
be utilized for hauling so that all turns can be safely made
without damage to vehicles, sidewalks, curbs or surrounding
property.
(6) All Township roads used by the operator for truck and/or
equipment hauling from the oil and gas drill site will be kept
and restored to the same or similar condition during and after
the drilling operations. Accordingly, prior to any drilling
§ 603 HOME RULE CHARTER § 603
Ch:811
operations, the Township and the operator shall enter into an
excess maintenance agreement, in a form acceptable to the
Township, in order to guarantee the repair and the restoration
of any Township road(s) which may be determined in the
reasonable professional opinion of the Township Engineer
founded, in whole or in part, on the inspection report and
the graphic documents in support of the inspection report,
to be subject to damage as a result of and in the course of
traffic generated by truck and/or equipment hauling from the
oil and gas drill site. In the excess maintenance agreement,
the operator must assume explicitly its responsibility to repair
and restore any Township road determined to be damaged as
a result of traffic generated by truck and/or equipment hauling
from the oil and gas drill site and in excess of the usual and
customary extent due to general vehicular use. The reasonable
professional opinion of the Township Engineer as to damage(s)
shall prevail hereunder.
(7) In addition to the aforesaid excess maintenance agreement and
to secure the performance thereof, the operator shall post a
bond or other financial security in favor of the Township and in
a form acceptable to the Township. The principal of the bond
shall be determined by the Township Engineer acting on behalf
of the Township. The bond to be posted by the operator may be
in a principal sum in excess of otherwise-applicable PennDOT
limits when the Township Engineer has reasonably estimated
that the cost of the repair and restoration of Township roads
will exceed the prevailing PennDOT bonding limits.
(8) The operator is responsible for the satisfactory and complete
repair and restoration of damaged roads, as above determined,
before the excess maintenance agreement can be terminated
and the security released.
(9) Notwithstanding any other provision herein set forth, the
operator shall, at all times, utilize the Township roads only in a
manner that permits unobstructed and safe passage for other
members of the traveling public. The operator shall covenant
in the excess maintenance agreement to make immediate
repair of any conditions on the road attributable to its use for
truck hauling from the oil and gas drill site which restricts use
of the road by the traveling public or causes or contributes to
an unsafe condition, including the removal of mud and dirt
from the road.
(10) Where truck traffic generated by oil and gas drill site hauling is
heavy in the proximity of school bus stops, the operator will
provide flagmen to ensure the safety of children waiting for or
leaving school buses.
§ 603 KINGSTON CODE § 603
Ch:812
(11) The access driveway off the public road to the drill site shall be
gated at the entrance to prevent illegal access into the drill
site. The drill site's assigned address shall be clearly visible on
the access gate for emergency 911 purposes. In addition, the
sign shall include the well name and number, the name of the
operator and the telephone number for a person responsible
who may be contacted in case of emergency.
(12) Access of well site roads directly to state roads shall require
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)
highway occupancy permit approval. Prior to initiating any
work at a drill site, the Township shall be provided a copy of
the highway occupancy permit.
(13) The operator shall not clear brush or trees by way of burning,
and it shall chip, grind or remove all tree stumps from
properties it clears for development purposes. The operator
shall comply in all respects with the Township's Burning
Ordinance.85
(14) Prior to development, the operator shall provide to all of the
Township's first responders (fire, police, ambulance, and
emergency medical treatment) and the Zoning Officer a copy of
its preparedness, prevention and contingency ("PPC") plan
relating to emergencies.
(15) Before drilling, the Township shall ascertain whether the
Township's first responders have secured adequate
information to cope satisfactorily with any potential dangerous
conditions that may result due to development activities. First
responders shall have initial access to on-site orientation and
be provided adequate emergency awareness information.
Upon request from the Township, the operator will, prior to
drilling of an oil and gas well, make available, with at least 30
days' notice, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate site
orientation for first responders. Such site orientation shall be
made available at least annually during the period when the
operator anticipates drilling activities in the Township.
(16) The operator shall take all necessary safeguards to ensure
appropriate dust-control measures are in place.
(17) Recognizing that the specific location of equipment and
facilities is an important and integral part of the oil and gas
development, as and as part of the planning process, the
operator shall strive to consider location of its temporary and
permanent operations, where prudent and possible, so as to
minimize interference with Township residents' enjoyment of
their property and future Township development activities as
85.Editor's Note: See Ch. 7, Fire Prevention and Fire Protection, Part 2, Open Burning.
§ 603 HOME RULE CHARTER § 603
Ch:813
authorized by this chapter and the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (Chapter 22).
(18) Recognizing that adequate and appropriate lighting is
essential to the safety of those involved in the development of
oil and gas, the operator shall take steps, to the extent
practicable, to direct site lighting downward and inward
toward the drill site, wellhead or other area being developed so
as to attempt to minimize glare on public roads and adjacent
buildings within 300 feet of the drill site, wellhead or other
area being developed.
B. Additional Conditions of Conditional Use for Purposes Provided for
Herein.
(1) Public Meeting.
(a) At least 30 days prior to the initial development activities
or any subsequent or additional development activities,
the operator must inform the Zoning Officer of such
development activities. The Zoning Officer shall thereupon
issue public notice once and written notice delivered by
regular United States mail of a public meeting to be held in
the Kingston Township Administration Building to be
conducted by the Board of Supervisors and the Planning
Commissioners jointly, at which the operator shall present
all general information regarding all such initial or
additional planned development activities. The written
notice of the public meeting required herein is limited to
owners or occupants of land lying within 1,000 feet of the
surface location(s) of the planned development activities.
All costs of public notice by publication and mail shall be
borne by the operator. The individual in primary charge of
such proposed development activities shall be present at
the public meeting.
(b) The operator shall provide to the Zoning Officer and each
Supervisor and Planning Commissioner the following
information at least 30 days before the aforesaid public

weekdays and 9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. on Saturdays and
Sundays.
(d) The Township recognizes and acknowledges that oil and
gas development is accomplished by inherent noise.
However, the operator shall take all reasonable steps to
minimize, to the extent practicable, the noise resulting
from the development. In the event that noise emanating
from the oil and gas development becomes an unlawful
nuisance within 1,000 feet of a protected structure, the
Township may require the operator, at its cost, to erect and
maintain suitable sound barriers surrounding the well site
as determined by the Township Engineer. The operator will
ensure that any and all vehicles servicing oil and gas well

§ 703. Stay of Proceedings. [Ord. 1989-5, 11/8/1989]
1. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the zoning
officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall
be stayed unless the zoning officer or any other appropriate agency or
body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the zoning officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
2. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to

by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
3. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
4. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney
fees incurred by the petitioner.
1. Public notice shall be given and written notice shall be given to the

Township, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or
findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final.

the application who has made timely appearance of record before the
Board, and any other person including civic or community
organizations permitted to appear by the Board. The Board shall have

enter appearances in writing on forms provided by the Board for that
purpose.
5. The chairman or acting chairman of the Board or the hearing officer
presiding shall have power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to

participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff
memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their solicitor,
unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the material so
noticed and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the
commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless
all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
10. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before
the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon together with the reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of this chapter or of any law,
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision
relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in
the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing
officer, and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings
are final, the Board shall make his report and recommendations
available to the parties within 45 days and the parties shall be entitled
to make written representations thereon to the Board prior to final
decision or entry of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered
no later than 30 days after the report of the hearing officer. Where the
Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this
subsection, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days from the
date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the
§ 704 KINGSTON CODE § 704
Ch:822
§ 705. Variances. [Ord. 1989-5, 11/8/1989]
applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time.
When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because
of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove
provided, the Board shall give public notice of the said decision within
10 days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in
the same manner as provided in Subsection 1 of this section. If the
Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing
in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing the
application to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.

findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have

decision or findings may be examined.

respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board.
1. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the zoning
officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
§ 704 HOME RULE CHARTER § 705
Ch:823
§ 706. Jurisdiction. [Ord. 1989-5, 11/8/1989]
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
2. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

B. Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising
procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an

ordinance of the Township and a Zoning Hearing Board has not
been previously established, the appeal raising procedural
questions shall be taken directly to court.
C. Appeals from the determination of the zoning officer, including, but
not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act
on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist

determination relates only to development not involving an Article
V or VII application, the appeal from such determination of the
zoning officer or the Township engineer shall be to the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to this section. Where the applicable land
use ordinance vests jurisdiction for final administration of
subdivision and land development applications in the Planning
Commission, all appeals from determinations under this subsection
shall be to the Planning Commission and all appeals from the

knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If

anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on
a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the zoning officer on a
challenge to the validity of this chapter or an amendment hereto or map
or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval

1. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof,
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the Board of
Supervisors with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in Section 916.1 of the

brought in accordance with this subsection and a court subsequently
rules that the challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result
in a declaration of invalidity for this entire chapter and Zoning Map, but
only for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's
curative amendment and challenge.
3. The Board of Supervisors, if it determines that a validity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the
challenged defects. The Board of Supervisors shall consider the
curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
A. The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
B. If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
C. The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
D. The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
E. The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
