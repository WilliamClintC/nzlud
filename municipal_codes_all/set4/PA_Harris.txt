proceedings to acquire such property before the end of the year.

establishment of any street nor the taking or acceptance of any
land, nor shall it obligate Harris Township to improve or maintain
any such street or land. The adoption of proposed watercourses or

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.

subsection.

AO:53
§ 2-3.2. Levy of tax.
§ 2-3.3. Exemption and refunds.
A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2009, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with the primary place of employment within the
Township of Harris during the tax year. Each natural person who
exercises such privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall
pay the tax for that year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata
basis, in accordance with the provisions of this article. This tax may be
used solely for the following purposes as the same may be allocated by
the Township of Harris from time to time:
(1) Emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services;
(2) Road construction and/or maintenance;
(3) Reduction of property taxes; or
(4) Property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and
farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85, Subch. F
(relating to homestead property exclusion).
B. The political subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived
from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other
taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person may be employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United Sates was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
§ 2-3.2 HARRIS CODE § 2-3.3
AO:54
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from that person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
§ 2-3.3 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 2-3.3
AO:55
§ 2-3.4. Duty of employers to collect.
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township of Harris, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township of Harris or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 0.01 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section; for purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
§ 2-3.3 HARRIS CODE § 2-3.4
AO:56
§ 2-3.5. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 2-3.6. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 2-3.7. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation of profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 2-3.3B of this
article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 2-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 2-3.7
AO:57
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 2-3.8. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 2-3.9. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 2-3.10. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office is or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,

refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.

aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of
199824 (municipalities may detail their appeal process).
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

It is the purpose of this article to provide for the health, safety, and welfare
of residents and visitors to Harris Township by regulating special events
which require special services provided by the Township, such as police,
traffic control, special parking requirements, ambulance, fire or emergency
services, or other special services, to provide for the health, safety, welfare,
and morals of persons attending such special events, the residents of the
Township, neighbors, and any others who may be affected by special events.

The Board of Supervisors of Harris Township finds and declares as follows:
A. There are many appropriate locations and occasions for the holding of
special events in Harris Township which draw large numbers of people
to attend.
B. Such special events often require the provision of services such as
traffic control, police protection, special parking regulations,
ambulance, fire safety, closing of streets to public traffic, and other
municipal, quasi-municipal, or other emergency or special services to
protect the health, safety, welfare, and morals of persons attending
such special events, the residents of the Township, neighbors, and any
others who may be affected by the special events.
C. It is necessary that the Township be made aware in advance of such
special events so that such special services can be provided and so that
the appropriate municipal, police, fire, ambulance and other services
are aware of such special events so as to provide services if needed.
D. That the provision of required or necessary services for such special
events entails costs which should be borne by the sponsors of such
special events.
E. That it is deemed expedient and necessary for the proper management,
care, and control of the Township and its finances and maintenance of
peace, good government and the welfare of the Township and its
residents to require all sponsors of special events to register such
special events, making arrangements in advance for all necessary
special services, and providing for the payment of all costs or expenses
incurred in the provision of such special services.

parked vehicles from interfering with the Company's operations.
A. Designation of no-parking areas. Whenever the Fire Chief, the Board of
Supervisors, or their designee shall determine that the parking of motor
or other vehicles on any portion of any public or private street, retail
property, multifamily parking lot, or school is likely to interfere with the
operation of the Fire Company or seriously hamper egress of occupants
from buildings in case of fire, he shall designate such areas as noparking
areas. The Fire Chief shall provide such designations in
writing, including the use of maps or sketches, to the Harris Township
Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors shall consider such
recommendations of the Fire Chief and shall either approve or
disapprove such designated locations. If approved, each designated noparking
area shall be added to a list, be numbered consecutively, and
the list shall be maintained in the Township office. Such list may be

parking surface indicating the area.
(c) By painting the words "Fire Lane - No Parking" in letters three
feet wide on the roadway or parking surface.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to designate the
fire lane by one of these three methods within 30 days of
notification by the Township. Whenever the state or Township
regulations for marking fire lanes change, the property owner shall
comply with the new standards within 90 days of notification.
Failure to comply shall result in the enforcement of this subarticle
as described herein.
C. Temporary no-parking areas. In the event of an emergency or special
condition whereby the Fire Chief shall determine that the parking of
vehicles is likely to interfere with the operation of the Fire Company in
any public or private street, retail property, multifamily building
parking lot or school, the Fire Chief shall notify the Police Department
of such condition. The Police Department may post signs in such areas
reading "No Parking - Temporary Fire Lane." Such signs shall be
removed by the Police Department, based upon consultation with the
Fire Chief, when such emergency or special condition ceases.
D. Violations and penalties. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this
subarticle for any person to park or leave standing any vehicle within
any fire lane established and marked as set forth in Subsection B herein
or in any temporary no-parking area as set forth in Subsection C herein.
In addition, it shall be unlawful for property owners to fail to designate
fire lanes determined appropriate by the Township as provided in

Sidewalk Maintenance
[Adopted 9-14-1987 by Ord. No. 112]
§ 7-2.1. Purpose.
This subarticle is intended to provide for the repair, reconstruction and
removal of obstructions from sidewalks available for use by the public which
are presently existing or which may be constructed in the future. This
subarticle is enacted for safety purposes in order to protect the public which
use such sidewalks, and to prevent dangerous conditions on sidewalks
intended for public use whether on public rights-of-way, on easements for
the use of the public, or on sidewalks located on private property. Such
dangerous conditions, in the form of improperly maintained or deteriorated
sidewalks, or in the form of obstructions, are declared to be nuisances
constituting a danger to the public.
§ 7-2.2. Definitions.
Unless a contrary intention clearly appears, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings given in this section. All words and terms
not defined herein shall be used with a meaning of standard usage.
OBSTRUCTION  An obstacle or impediment which renders the sidewalk
impassable without unreasonable inconvenience or hazard.
RECONSTRUCT  To replace and rebuild or relay a sidewalk upon
determination that it can no longer be repaired by patching and fixing.
REPAIR  To restore to a safe and sound state by patching or fixing after
decay, deterioration or partial destruction.
SIDEWALK  A paved walkway for pedestrians available for use by the
general public, whether located on the owner's property, in an easement
for public passage, or within the right-of-way of any street, drive, avenue,
highway, road, lane or alley.
§ 7-2.3. Duty of property owner.
It shall be the duty of owners of property upon which sidewalks presently
exist or upon which sidewalks are constructed to maintain them in good
repair, repair and reconstruct them when necessary, and keep them free
from obstructions and safe for passage by pedestrians.
§ 7-2.4. Notice to repair, reconstruct or remove obstructions.
A. In the event that the condition of any sidewalk is observed by the
Township Manager or other authorized Township employee to require
repair, reconstruction or removal of obstacles, a written notice shall be
§ 7-2.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 7-2.4
AO:149
§ 7-2.5. Time limits for repair, reconstruction or removal of
obstacles after notice.
§ 7-2.6. Specifications for reconstruction.
When it is determined that reconstruction of a sidewalk is necessary, or in
the event a property owner reconstructs a sidewalk prior to determination
or notice, the same shall be reconstructed according to the following
specifications:
sent to the property owners requiring them to repair, reconstruct or
remove obstructions. The notice shall specify the nature of the defect or
obstruction, the portion of the sidewalk to be repaired or reconstructed,
or the obstruction to be removed. For repair or reconstruction, the
notice shall also specify the current construction material and the scope
of the repair or reconstruction required.
B. Reconstruction shall be accomplished according to the specifications
set forth in this subarticle. Repairs shall be made according to the
criteria for repairs set forth in this subarticle. Said notice shall be
delivered personally to the owner, sent by certified mail, or posted on
the property.
A. The property owner shall effect, or cause to be effected, the repairs or
reconstruction described in the notice within 90 days after the receipt
of the notice specified above. In the event that the Township Manager
determines that the condition constitutes a dangerous condition or an
emergency, the Township Manager may reduce the time for repairs,
reconstruction or removal of obstacles to 48 hours or to such period as
he deems necessary and appropriate.
B. In the event of an obstruction, the property owner shall remove or shall
cause to be removed the obstruction within seven days of receipt of
notice or, if deemed to constitute an emergency, within 48 hours or such
other time period as he deems necessary and appropriate.
A. ASTM standards. Materials and methods shall meet the requirements of
the latest specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials
(ASTM).
B. Width. The standard width for all sidewalks shall be four feet, except as
follows:
(1) Additional width. In areas designated "Commercial" on the
Township Zoning Map, the Township Supervisors may require by
resolution an additional width so that the sidewalk shall extend
from the curbline to the property line.
(2) Less width. In places where the sidewalk cannot be made four feet
wide because of existing tree trunks or roots, the Township
Supervisors may, upon request of the property owner, allow a lesser
width.
§ 7-2.4 HARRIS CODE § 7-2.6
AO:150
C. Portland cement concrete sidewalks. All sidewalks shall be constructed
of portland cement.
D. Material. All concrete shall be Class A (3,300 psi), 28 days compressive
strength and have one- to three-inch slump, 5% to 7% air entrainment,
six to eight bags of cement per cubic yard of concrete, and a maximum
water-cement ratio of 0.50 (lbs./lbs.).
E. Grades. The grass plot shall have a slope of 3/8 inch per foot rise from
top of curb to street edge of sidewalk. The sidewalk shall have a 1/4
inch per foot rise from the street edge to the abutting property edge of
the sidewalk. Grades may be adjusted on an individual basis, as
authorized by the Township Engineer or Manager.
F. Subgrade foundation. The subgrade shall be well drained and
thoroughly compacted to a firm, even and uniform bearing surface.
Unsuitable material shall be removed and replaced.
G. Forms. Forms extending the full depth of the concrete shall be used.
H. Drains. Drains will be installed, when necessary, to protect the sidewalk
from frost damage.
I. Thickness. All sidewalks shall be of one course construction not less
than four inches thick in residential and commercial areas and not less
than six inches where a driveway crosses the sidewalk.
J. Contraction joints shall be spaced in uniform lengths or sections of five
feet for sidewalk and may be either hand formed or sawed. If sawed,
they shall be 3/16 inch wide and a minimum of two inches deep.
K. Expansion joints shall be constructed of premolded one-half-inch
expansion material placed the full depth of the sidewalk, curb, or curb
gutter and at right angles to the surfaces of the aforementioned.
Expansion material shall be placed between the sidewalk and any rigid
structure (e.g., another sidewalk, curb or curb gutter, inlet, concrete
driveway, light post).
L. Edging. All hand-formed contraction and expansion joints shall be
edged with an edge having a one-fourth-inch maximum radius.
M. Slip-resistant textures. A slip-resistant texture shall be achieved on all
sidewalks by coarse brooming of the finished surfaces.
N. Curing. All concrete shall be cured by applying a white pigmented
liquid membrane-forming curing compound or another method with
authorization of the Township Engineer.
O. Sealing. All new concrete shall be sprayed with an antispalling
compound (boiled linseed oil) mixture at the rate of 0.02 gallon per
square yard or at the rate specified by the manufacturer, applied
approximately 45 days to 60 days following placement. Application shall
be by pressure-spray equipment, portable hand-spray equipment,
§ 7-2.6 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 7-2.6
AO:151
§ 7-2.7. Criteria for repairs.
The following criteria shall be followed in making repairs:
brushing or by a combination of these methods to insure complete
coverage of treated concrete surfaces. It is recommended that a second
application be made a minimum of 24 hours after the initial application.
P. Placing and finishing. Concrete shall be placed, consolidated, struck off
and floated until an even and true surface is obtained. Care shall be
taken to avoid overfinishing (i.e., bringing to the surface an excess of
water and fine sand).
Q. Backfilling. After the concrete has cured for at least 72 hours, spaces
adjacent to the sidewalk shall be backfilled with topsoil and compacted
in such a manner to prevent settling below sidewalk grade.
R. Seeding. Disturbed areas shall be seeded and/or mulched as necessary
to insure new growth over disturbed areas.
A. Horizontal alignment. A sidewalk square must be repaired when a crack
within a square or a joint between two adjacent squares has separated
to a distance of 3/8 inch or greater, or when the edges of a crack are
chipped or broken to create surface openings of 3/8 inch or more.
Where expansion or contraction joints have widened to 3/8 inch or
greater, repairs should be made in such a way as to allow for expansion
to occur later. If multiple cracks exist within a square, or if vertical
movement occurs around a crack, the square should be removed and
replaced.
B. Vertical alignment. Repairs must be made when a sidewalk square or
portion of it has risen or sunk 3/4 inch or more in relation to the
remainder of the square or to an adjacent square. The square can be
physically raised or lowered to be realigned with the adjacent squares.
If an entire square has sunk, it may be patched with concrete bonded
overlay of the entire square. The minimum thickness of this patch
cannot be less than one inch. Placing a wedge of patch material over a
portion of the square is not acceptable.
C. Surface deterioration. A sidewalk square must be repaired when 25%
or more of the exposed horizontal surface has chipped or crumbled,
exposing aggregate and creating peaks and valleys, to a depth at any
point of 1/2 inch or more below the original surface.
D. Portland cement. Repair must be made with a half-and-half mixture of
portland cement and sand, or with a commercial two-part epoxy-type
concrete patch material.
E. Removal of deteriorated materials. Deteriorated materials must first be
removed to a depth adequate to expose sound concrete and this surface
prepared with bonding material to epoxy as prescribed by the patch
material manufacturer.
§ 7-2.6 HARRIS CODE § 7-2.7
AO:152
§ 7-2.8. Maintenance of trees, poles, pipes or other objects.
Trees, shrubbery, bushes, poles, pipes, or other objects now or hereafter
placed or maintained on the sidewalk limitations, or which overhang the
sidewalk pavements as are herein provided, shall be so placed or
maintained as to prevent injury to person or property and shall be removed,
changed or trimmed upon 10 days' notice whenever, in the judgment of the
Township Manager, it is deemed necessary for the health, safety, welfare
and convenience of the Township or of the inhabitants of the particular
section thereof. Such trees, poles, pipes or other objects overhanging the
sidewalks which are obstructions shall constitute a nuisance. Failure to
remove such obstructions after notice to do so shall constitute a violation of
this subarticle.
§ 7-2.9. Driveways in public right-of-way.
Where driveways exist or are hereafter constructed between the sidewalk
and curbline, or from the street to the abutting property, they must be so
constructed that the material used will not work loose or scatter from the
driveway (e.g., portland cement concrete, bituminous concrete, or brick).
§ 7-2.10. Failure to comply deemed nuisance.
Failure of a property owner to effect repair, reconstruction or removal of
obstructions after expiration of the time limit specified in the notice and in
accordance with such notice and the terms of this subarticle shall constitute
a nuisance and a violation of this subarticle.
§ 7-2.11. Work done by Township; costs.
Upon failure of any owner of property to effect the repair of, reconstruction
of, or removal of obstacles on the sidewalk within the time period specified
in the notice, the Township Manager may, in addition to all other penalties,
cause the same to be done and collect the cost of same from the property
owner, together with a penalty of 10%, by summary proceedings in the
manner provided for the collection of municipal claims, by action of
assumpsit without the filing of a claim, or by actions instituted in courts of
equity.
§ 7-2.12. Violations and penalties.59
Failure of a property owner to effect the repair, reconstruction or removal of
obstruction within the time period specified in the notice and in accordance
with such notice and the terms of this subarticle shall constitute a violation.
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this
F. Reinspection. All repairs must be completely intact when reinspected,
i.e., a sealed crack must show no sign of recracking, no additional
deterioration may have occurred on the edges of the patch area, etc.

Receipts from the pumper/hauler shall be submitted to the municipality
or authorized agent within 30 days of the date of pumping.
B. An option will be provided to allow the property owner to request a
waiver from pumping every three years if, because of tank size,
household size, or seasonal use, it is determined by the municipality's
certified SEO that such pumping is not needed. In such cases, a waiver
from pumping can be granted at the discretion of the municipality's
certified SEO when an inspection of the tank by the municipal SEO
reveals that the solids are less than 1/3 the liquid depth of the tank.

Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld
and shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(3) Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in
such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial
security for the purposes of this section.
(4) Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by
the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the commonwealth.
(5) Such bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required
on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
(6) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
§ 11-2.4 HARRIS CODE § 11-2.4
AO:246
(7) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Township and the applicant or developer.
(8) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Township Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of
final plats by sections or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future sections
or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of
any finally approved section of the development.
(10) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Township
Board of Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time
to time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for
payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any
such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Township Board
of Supervisors, and the Township Board of Supervisors shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Municipal Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Township Board of
Supervisors that such portion of the work upon the improvements
has been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon
such certification, the Township Board of Supervisors shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Municipal Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed, or, if the
Township Board of Supervisors fails to act within said forty-five-day
period, the Township Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have
§ 11-2.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-2.4
AO:247
§ 11-2.5. Record plan.
After completion of the procedures required by this chapter, and after final
approval by the Board of Supervisors, all endorsements shall be so indicated
on the approved plan and on as many other copies of the plan as may
be desired by the Board of Supervisors. Upon approval and signing of the
approved the release of funds as requested. The Township Board
of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(11) Where the Township Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all
or some of the required improvements following completion, the
Township Board of Supervisors may require the posting of financial
security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as well
as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the
design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not
to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not
exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
(12) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Township, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
(13) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final
plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall
not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.

ARTICLE IV
Design and Improvement Standards
§ 11-4.1. General requirements. [Amended 10-9-1995 by Ord. No.
169]
A. Design and improvements. The design and physical improvements to
the property being subdivided shall be provided, constructed, and
installed by the subdivider as shown on the approved plan in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter. If any provisions of
this chapter are found to be unreasonable and cause undue and
unnecessary hardship as they apply to a proposed subdivision, the
Board of Supervisors may waive or vary the strict terms of such
provisions. The criteria for the Board of Supervisors to apply in
determining whether to waive or vary the strict application of a
provision are:
(1) That there exist special physical circumstances or conditions which
render the strict application of the requirements as undue
unnecessary hardship.
(2) That the hardship created cannot be ameliorated by a reasonable
change in plans.
(3) That the unnecessary or undue hardship has not been created by
the applicant.
(4) That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
chapter.
(5) That the property cannot be reasonably developed without the
waiver or the varying of the strict terms of this chapter.
(6) That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
represent the minimum deviation that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulations in issue.
B. Land requirements.
(1) All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots,
streets, public lands or other proposed uses so that remnants and
landlocked areas shall not be created.
(2) Reserve strips preventing access to lots, public rights-of-way,
public lands, or adjacent private lands are prohibited.
(3) Applicants shall preserve, to the maximum extent feasible, trees,
groves, waterways, scenic points, historic landmarks and other
assets and landmarks significant to the community.
§ 11-4.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.1
AO:255
(4) Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out so as to avoid
the necessity for excessive cut or fill, as determined by the Harris
Township Engineer.
(5) Land which the Board of Supervisors finds to be unsuitable for
building purposes due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slope,
rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to
the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas shall not
be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the applicant and approved by the Board of
Supervisors, upon recommendation of the Township Planning
Commission and Engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses
that shall not involve such a danger or shall be incorporated into
other suitable lots.
(6) The following factors are to be considered as supplemental to the
above sections and shall be shown on plans where applicable:
(a) Visual resources. Integration of visual resources within the
development is to be shown. Visual resources are items that
are reflective of the character of Harris Township and include
but are not limited to:
[1] Hedgerows along edges of farm fields that have become
established over time.
[2] Rights-of-way and cartways that have been established as
farm lanes, paths, and other forms of access.
[3] Woodlot areas representing significant tree growth (tree
size or age) or animal habitat locations.
[4] Trees, shrubs and vegetation on slopes of 15% or steeper
that are beneficial to erosion control.
[5] Prominent knolls and hilltops.
(b) Cultural and historic resources. Cultural and historic resources
of local heritage, state, and/or national importance shall be
preserved wherever possible and integrated into the overall
development. Applicants shall refer to "Historic Resources of
the Centre Region" and "Harris Township Register of Historic
Sites and Landmarks," as revised, as a guide for identifying
buildings, sites, and landmarks of local heritage, state, and/or
national importance.
(c) Hydric soils as identified in the Centre County Soil Survey,
1981, as amended.
§ 11-4.1 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.1
AO:256
§ 11-4.2. Streets. [Amended 2-9-2004 by Ord. No. 242]
(d) Prime agricultural soils, Classes I and II, in an open/cleared
condition, from both the Centre County Soil Survey, 1981, and
the 1990 Land Use Survey and subsequent updates of both
documents.
(e) Properties participating in the State Agricultural Conservation
Easement Program or are part of an Agricultural Security
Area, Clean and Green Program, Farmland Preservation Trust,
Pennsylvania State Forest Stewardship Program, or any formal
conservation easement program.
A. Relationship to other plans and ordinances. The location of all streets
shall conform to the Official Map or Comprehensive Plan adopted by the
Township.
B. Dedication of private streets. Dedication of any street is permitted only
if it is totally accessible via a public street and meets the design
standards of this chapter. Private streets are permitted only if the
Township Engineer certifies that the proposed street has sufficient
right-of-way width, grade, and other conditions which will make future
construction possible in accordance with Township standards; and that
the subdivider submits, prior to preliminary approval, to be recorded
with the plan, a copy of an agreement made with the Board of
Supervisors on behalf of his heirs and assigns establishing the
conditions under which the street may later be offered for dedication,
stipulating, among other things, that:
(1) The private street, unless or until built to Township standards, shall
provide sole access for no more than five units and shall be
surfaced with a hard material sufficient to insure a mud-free or
otherwise permanently passable condition.98
(2) The street shall conform to the Township standards or that the
owners of the abutting lots include with the offer of dedication
sufficient funds, as estimated by the Township Engineer, to restore
the street to conformance with the Township standards prior to
dedication.
(3) Any offer to dedicate the street shall be made only for the street as
a whole.
(4) The method of assessing repair costs prior to dedication shall be as
stipulated in the agreement.
(5) Should dedication be proposed, agreement by owners of 51% of the
front footage thereon shall be binding on the owners of the
remaining lots.

§ 11-4.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.2
AO:257
C. Street layout. Residential streets shall be so laid out as to discourage
through traffic. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
continuation of existing or recorded streets. Streets shall be related
appropriately to the topography, arranged so as to obtain usable
building sites with as many as possible located at or above the street
grade. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography, and a combination of steep grades and curves shall
be avoided.
D. Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
others existing and named shall bear the names of the existing streets.
(1) In no case shall the name of a proposed street duplicate or
approximate phonetically existing or recorded street names in the
Centre Region, or approximate such names by the use of suffixes
such as "lane," "way," "drive," "court," or "avenue."
(2) All street names shall be subject to the approval of the Board of
Supervisors.
(3) All house numbers shall be assigned and approved by the Zoning
Officer prior to filing the plan for final approval.
E. Access to arterial streets. Where a subdivision or land development
borders on or contains an existing or recorded arterial, the Board of
Supervisors may require that access to such streets be limited by one of
the following means:
(1) The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front onto
a parallel local or collector street; no access shall be provided from
the arterial.
(2) A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel
street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots abutting the
arterial.
(3) A marginal-access road constructed parallel to the arterial right-ofway
meeting all applicable standards contained herein.
F. Access through adjacent municipalities. Whenever access to a
subdivision or land development is required to cross land in another
Township, assurance shall be provided that such access shall be
permitted by the adjacent Township. The street shall be adequately
improved for access through agreement between the property owner
and the adjacent Township prior to final approval of the plan.
G. Slope along banks. Along streets, the slope of earthen banks, measured
perpendicular to the street center line, shall be no steeper than a 1:3
vertical-horizontal measurement for fills and a 1:2 vertical-horizontal
measurement for cuts.
§ 11-4.2 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.2
AO:258
H. Other streets. Unless otherwise stated, all standards for local streets
shall apply to alleys and marginal-access streets.

detailed in Subsection V of this section.
(1) Right-of-way and cartway widths in excess of those shown in
Subsection V of this section may be requested by the Board of
Supervisors for the purpose of promoting the public safety and
convenience, or to provide additional parking in commercial and
industrial areas and in areas of high-density residential
development.
(2) Where a subdivision abuts an existing street with a right-of-way
less than that required herein, the subdivider shall expand such in
an amount equal to 1/2 the difference between the existing right-ofway
width and that required herein. Where a subdivision contains
an existing street with a right-of-way width less than that required
herein, that subdivider shall expand such equally on each side in an
amount necessary to meet the standards contained herein.
J. Street grades.
(1) There shall be a minimum center-line grade of 1%.
(2) Center-line grades shall not exceed the following: local streets,
10%; collector streets, 8%; and arterial streets, 6%.
(3) Exceptions. The maximum grade at any intersection or cul-de-sac
turnaround shall not exceed 1%. Intersections shall be approached
on all sides by a straight leveling area, the grade of which shall not
exceed 4% within 50 feet of the intersection of the nearest right-ofway
lines.
K. Horizontal curves.
(1) Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of 5°, connection
shall be made by horizontal curves.
(2) The minimum radius of horizontal curves shall be 100 feet for local
streets, 200 feet for collector streets, and 300 feet and 500 feet for
secondary and primary arterials, respectively.

considering a driver's eye level at 3.5 feet above grade: local
streets (30 mph maximum speed), 200 feet; collector streets (40
mph maximum speed), 325 feet; arterial streets, as required by the
§ 11-4.2 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.2
AO:259
Township and other applicable state and federal agencies. Sight
distances for other speed limits shall be computed according to
the PennDOT Design Manual, Part 2, most recent edition. All sight
distance computations shall be submitted with the plan.
(2) At intersections, all earth banks and vegetation shall be cut and
removed when such will impede vision between a height of 2 1/2
and 10 feet above the center-line grades of the intersecting streets
and within an area bounded by the street right-of-way lines of such
corner lots and a line joining points on these street right-of-way
lines 25 feet from their intersection. All intersection sight distances
shall be in accordance with PennDOT Design Manual, Part 2, most
recent edition. All sign distance triangles shall be shown on the
plans, and sight distance computations shall be submitted with the
plan.
M. Intersections.
(1) Cartways shall intersect at a ninety-degree angle for a minimum of
50 feet from the intersection.
(2) No more than two streets shall intersect at the same point.
(3) Wherever possible, local streets shall not intersect directly with
arterial streets, but shall be linked by means of a collector street.
(4) Wherever possible, intersections of two streets on opposite sides of
a street shall be cross intersections. Any street intersecting with a
local street shall be located no closer than 200 feet from another
street intersecting the same local street; any street intersecting
with a collector street shall be located no closer than 300 feet from
another street intersecting the same collector street; and any
street intersecting with an arterial street shall not be located closer
than 1,000 feet from another street intersecting the same arterial
street, regardless of whether the two intersecting streets are on
the same side or on opposite sides of said local, collector or arterial
street (except where the intersected street has an unbroken
median barrier). Distances shall be measured from the center line
of the two intersecting streets along the center line of said local,
collector, or arterial street.
(5) Street curb intersections where curbs are installed shall be
rounded by a tangential arc with a minimum radius of 20 feet for
intersections involving only local streets, 30 feet for all
intersections involving a collector street, and 40 feet for all
intersections involving an arterial street.
N. Alleys. Alleys are prohibited in developments of single-family detached
residences, but may be permitted in other types of development,
provided the applicant produces evidence satisfactory to the Board of
Supervisors of the need for such alleys, and provided these are not
primary means of access.
§ 11-4.2 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.2
AO:260
O. Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets.
(1) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as permanent culde-
sac streets or for future access to adjoining properties as
stipulated in Subsection O(2) of this section. The Board of
Supervisors may require extension of a proposed cul-de-sac to
permit access to adjacent property or to connect such street with
an adjoining existing or proposed street.
(2) Any street dead-ended for access to an adjoining property or
because of authorized stage development shall be provided with a
temporary, all-weather cul-de-sac, within the subdivision, and the
use of such cul-de-sac shall be guaranteed to the public until such
time as the street is extended. The plan shall note that land outside
the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the
street is continued.
(3) The center-line grade on a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed 10%.
(4) The Board of Supervisors may require the reservations of

cartway.
C. Where existing storm sewers are reasonably accessible, proposed
subdivisions shall be required, if necessary, to connect therewith.
D. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed not only to handle the
anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided, but
also the anticipated runoff that will occur when property at a higher
elevation in the same watershed is fully developed.
E. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse,
drainageway, channel, or stream and of such width as will be adequate
to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage, or for the purpose
of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such
drainage facilities. Any changes in the existing drainageway shall be
subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.105

C. Amount of parkland required. For any residential development or
subdivision larger than five dwelling units, the amount of parkland to be
dedicated as a condition of plan approval shall be five acres of parkland
per 100 dwelling units, or 0.05 acre of parkland per dwelling unit. To
prevent minor subdivisions which could serve to circumvent the
parkland requirement, these regulations shall apply to all parent tracts
(as defined in Chapter 12) of 10 acres or larger at the time of adoption
of this section.
D. If land is to be offered for public dedication, the subdivider or developer
shall place the following note on the subdivision or land development
plan:
"No more than _______ (insert number) dwelling units may be
constructed on the land which is the subject of the plan, unless
additional land is dedicated and/or the Township Board of Supervisors
accepts an additional fee in lieu of dedication of parkland."
E. The Harris Township Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation of
Harris Township staff, the Centre Regional Planning Agency, the Harris
Township Planning Commission, the Harris Township Parks and
Recreation Committee, the Centre Region Parks and Recreation
Department, and the Harris Township Engineer, shall determine if the
land proposed by the developer is acceptable for dedication based upon
the adopted recreation plan and other relevant criteria, including, but
not limited to, the following:
(1) General design. Areas shall be designed as neighborhood parks or
natural areas to provide recreation opportunities for residents
within the proposed subdivision or for residents living in proximity
to the proposed park. Exceptions may be made when dedications
are made to a regional park which is located within two miles of the
center of the subdivision.
(2) Access. The parkland shall be accessible from a public street or
shall adjoin and become part of an already existing park area which
is accessible from a public street. Where access to the park is by a
public road, the width of the frontage shall be a minimum length
deemed necessary by the municipality for access, visibility of the
site, and public safety. Depending upon the parkland size or shape,
the Board may require access from an additional public street.
(3) Shape and slope. The majority (51% or greater) of the parkland
shall have a lot length to width ratio no greater than 2.5 to one.
Steep slopes, floodplains, and drainageways may not be used for
parkland. Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas
required by zoning and other regulations are not to be included as
part of the acreage to be dedicated.
§ 11-4.12 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.12
AO:289
(4) Stormwater management facilities. Stormwater basins shall not be
considered as parkland, nor should any credit be given for the
stormwater detention basin land toward the required parkland.
(5) Shared-use paths. The dedication and construction of shared-use
paths may be accepted as parkland if they meet all of the following
conditions: [Amended 4-23-2014 by Ord. No. 310]
(a) The minimum width of the parkland right-of-way or easement
shall be 20 feet. If a parkland easement is proposed, the
developer shall enter into an agreement with Harris Township
which stipulates how shared-use paths will be maintained and
repaired.
(b) Shared-use paths offered in place of parkland shall meet the
standards outlined in the AASHTO Guide for the Development
of Bicycle Facilities 2012, Fourth Edition.
(c) Credit towards parkland dedication requirements shall be
given at the ratio of 75 linear feet of shared-use path for each
dwelling unit in the proposed development. If additional
parkland is required in excess of any shared-use path provided,
the developer shall provide parkland in the amount required in
Subsection C of this section or through the offering of a fee-inlieu
payment, if approved by the municipality.
(d) Construction of shared-use paths identified on the Official Map
of Harris Township or those that are required within the
Corridor Overlay District may be accepted as parkland if the
requirements of this section are met.
(e) The shared-use paths shall have logical beginning and ending
points that provide appropriate means of access to a park or
other facilities residents of the development are likely to use.
Other facilities can include existing shared-use paths,
bikeways, Pennsylvania Bike Route G, hiking trails, schools,
etc.
(f) The cost of constructing the shared-use path shall be provided
by the developer in order to accommodate its intended use.
The cost of development shall not be considered as a credit
towards a fee in lieu of land dedication.
(g) The provisions of Subsection E(3), Shape and slope, of this
section must still be met by the proposed development.
(6) Trails or linear parks. The Township may accept the dedication of
linear trails or parks if they connect to existing trails identified by
the Centre Regional Planning Commission, or if they are adjacent
to Cedar Run, Spring Creek, Slab Cabin Run, Roaring Run or
Galbraith Run and meet the following criteria:
§ 11-4.12 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.12
AO:290
(a) Actual dedications of land shall have an average width of at
least 75 feet.
(b) The trail or linear park shall conform to any applicable
municipal park and open space plan, any county-wide trail and
recreation master plan, and appropriate Township and County
Comprehensive Plans.
(c) The cost of improving a trail or linear park shall be provided by
the developer in order to accommodate its intended use. This
shall not be considered a credit towards a fee in lieu of land
dedication. This requirement is necessary since the dedication
of narrow strips of land has relatively little value compared to a
larger parcel.
(7) Utilities. The majority of dedicated land shall be accessible to
electric, water, and sewer utilities. No aboveground utilities shall
be placed on the parkland unless granted specific permission by
the Board of Supervisors. If any of these facilities are placed
underground, no part of the facilities and their supportive
equipment shall protrude above ground level.
(8) Stormwater. The developer shall be responsible for complying with
the provisions of Chapter 13, Stormwater Management, of the
Code of the Township of Harris. The stormwater management plan
submitted to the Township for the subject development must
provide mechanisms to ensure effective stormwater management
for the dedicated parkland property.
(9) Unity. It is desirable for the parkland to be in well-placed,
adequately sized areas within the Township so that they can
accommodate the anticipated uses.
(10) Dedication. If it is determined that the land proposed for dedication
is acceptable, the Township may officially accept the land at the
time of final approval of the development plan. At such time, a deed
shall be recorded for the dedicated land, and it shall contain the
following restrictive clause: "This land was acquired for perpetual
public park purposes through the implementation of the Harris
Township Subdivision Ordinance."
(a) The Township or its designee shall be responsible for
maintaining all dedicated and accepted areas. Formation of
and cooperation with homeowners' associations or similar
organizations, for the purpose of maintenance, shall be
encouraged. The responsibility for ensuring that all required
work is completed shall remain with the Township.
(11) A note shall be added to the subdivision or land development plan
for land specifically designated as parkland and shall state the
following:
§ 11-4.12 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.12
AO:291
"The land shown on this plan as parkland, consisting of _______
acres, shall be deeded to Harris Township by a deed of general
warranty, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and at
a date no later than the date of dedication of the streets shown
on this land development/subdivision plan. Said land shall be
available for Harris Township use consistent with its ordinances
and regulations with no restriction, except that the purposes of
the conveyance shall be public park and recreation uses. It shall
be used for such purposes, and Harris Township may also, at
its sole discretion, sell this land, provided that the proceeds of
such sale are specifically restricted for use for public park and
recreation purposes in connection with a continuing program for
such purposes in Harris Township or in connection with existing
park facilities or to obtain additional park facilities in Harris
Township."
F. Fee-in-lieu option. A fee in lieu of parkland may be offered by the
developer if at least one of the following conditions exist:
(1) The proposed development does not contain land suitable for
parkland dedication.
(2) The proposed development is too small for a suitable amount of
land to be dedicated.
(3) The location of parkland within the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with the adopted Harris Township parks and recreation
plan.
(4) A fee in lieu of parkland dedication will not be contrary to the
public interest.
G. Fee in lieu of land dedication.
(1) The payment of fee in lieu of land dedication shall be in accordance
with the requirements of Article V, Section 503(11), of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247), as amended,
53 P.S. § 10503(11). The fee in lieu of parkland shall be used to
enhance public recreation areas which will directly or indirectly
benefit future inhabitants of the development or subdivision
providing the fee.
(2) After receiving the recommendation of Harris Township staff, the
Centre Regional Planning Agency, the Harris Township Planning
Commission, the Harris Township Parks and Recreation
Committee, the Centre Region Parks and Recreation Agency, and
the Harris Township Engineer, the Harris Township Board of
Supervisors may, at its option and with the developer's agreement,
determine that a fee in lieu would be more beneficial to the
Township residents than a land dedication for parkland. The
§ 11-4.12 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.12
AO:292
§ 11-4.13. Fire-protection standards. [Added 2-9-2004 by Ord. No.
241]
following procedure shall be utilized to determine the appropriate
fee in lieu:
(a) As part of the plan approval process, the Township Manager,
under the direction of the Board of Supervisors, shall send
written notice to the developer that the Board has determined
a fee in lieu would be more beneficial to the Township's
residents than the dedication of parkland.
(b) The fee-in-lieu payment shall be determined using the
following procedure:
DU x Parkland Fee = Parkland Fee in Lieu
DU = Number of Dwelling Units
Parkland Fee = Fee established by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors
(3) In some instances, there may be insufficient suitable land available
within a proposed development to meet park and recreation
requirements. In those cases, the Board may elect, at its option and
with the developer's agreement, to require the dedication of land
for a portion of the required amount and the payment of a fee for
the balance to satisfy the parkland dedication requirements of this
section.
A. Plan preparation requirements.
(1) The applicant shall contact the applicable community water
system(s) to obtain fire flow rates for the water system(s) proposed
to serve the subdivision or land development. These flow rates shall
be noted on the plan.
(2) The location, construction detail, and ownership/maintenance
information of any water storage system shall be provided on the
plan. Approved design specifications for underground storage
tanks shall be obtained from the Centre Region Fire Administrator.

within the proposed development will have a built-in firesuppression
system, including, but not limited to, automatic
sprinkler systems.
(5) Details for all existing and proposed fire apparatus access routes
shall be noted on the plan.
§ 11-4.12 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.13
AO:293
B. Fire-protection plan review procedure.
(1) The Township shall provide a copy of all subdivision and land
development plans to the Fire Chief of the Boalsburg Fire
Company, or its successor, at the time plans are provided to the
Centre Regional Planning Agency (CRPA) and Township Engineer

compliance with applicable fire-protection standards and does
hereby certify that compliance with those standards has been
demonstrated.
Signature of Chief or other designated Fire Company official
C. Water supply requirements. Developments served by community water
systems.
(1) Existing fire hydrants on public streets may be considered
available; existing fire hydrants on adjacent private streets shall
not be considered available.
(2) The minimum fire flow requirements for proposed developments of
one- and two-family dwellings with front, side, and rear building
setback requirements of at least 15 feet, or building separation
distances of at least 30 feet, shall be 750 gallons per minute.
(3) The minimum fire flow requirements for developments of one- and
two-family dwellings with any building setback requirement of less
§ 11-4.13 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.13
AO:294
than 15 feet, or building separation distances of less than 30 feet,
shall be 1,000 gallons per minute.
(4) The minimum fire flow requirements for developments other than
one- and two-family dwellings shall be determined using the
needed fire flow method described in the Fire Suppression Rating
Schedule published by the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO).
(5) If the required fire flow is not provided in a development proposed
to be served by a community water system, all dwellings and
occupied structures shall be provided with an approved automatic
fire sprinkler system installed in accordance with the applicable
NFPA standard.
(a) The Fire Chief may accept a deficiency of up to 10% of the
required fire flow where existing fire hydrants provide all or a
portion of the required flow. Written notice of the deficiency
and the Fire Chief's approval of such shall be noted on the
plan.
(b) Subdivisions and land developments of one- and two-family
dwellings located outside of the Regional Growth Boundary
and served by a community water system may utilize water
storage systems, as described in Subsection D of this section,
to satisfy the water supply requirements.
D. Water supply requirements; developments not served by community
water systems.
(1) The minimum water supply requirements for developments of oneand
two-family dwellings shall be met with either the installation of
a four-thousand-gallon approved water storage source located
along required fire apparatus accessed roads or the installation of
an approved automatic fire sprinkler system installed in
accordance with the applicable NFPA standard. The spacing
between the four-thousand-gallon water storage sources shall not
exceed 1,500 feet measured along the center line of the fire
apparatus access roads. The distance from any building setback
line to a four-thousand-gallon water storage source shall not

AO:295
§ 11-4.14. Riparian buffer area. [Added 4-11-2011 by Ord. No. 292]
condition of approval of any subdivision or land development plan.
If a developer desires to delay construction of any improvements
necessary to meet the fire-protection requirements until such time
as structures actually are constructed on the property, the
developer must post, prior to receiving final approval of any
subdivision or land development plan, a surety in a form and
amount agreeable to the Township Engineer. This surety can be
posted in increments of five years, with such surety being
renewable at the end of the five-year term. At least six months
prior to the expiration of the financial security, the developer must
renew the financial security or have constructed all improvements
secured thereby. To the extent not inconsistent with this section,
all other terms and conditions relating to the financial security
required by this section shall be the same as for other financial
security posted pursuant to this Chapter 11. [Added 8-13-2007 by
Ord. No. 271]
E. Fire apparatus access.
(1) Facilities, buildings, or portions of buildings hereafter constructed
in subdivisions or land developments approved after the effective
date of this section shall be accessible to Fire Department
apparatus by way of an approved fire apparatus access road with
an asphalt, concrete, or other approved driving surface capable of
supporting the imposed load of fire apparatus. An exception shall
be granted for private roads that serve five or fewer dwellings.
(2) The paved cartway width for all public streets shall meet Township
standards. Minimum paved cartway width for fire apparatus access
roads shall be 20 feet. An exception shall be granted for private
roads that serve five or fewer dwellings.
A. Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategy goals and objectives.
(1) In order for Pennsylvania to meet the aggressive goals of the
Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategy, communities located within
this drainage area will need to implement best management
practices (BMPs) to address point and nonpoint pollution sources;
riparian buffers are one of the BMPs that will help the Centre
Region meet these goals; and
(2) The Centre Region is fortunate to contain high-quality waterways
which make significant contributions to our environment and
quality of life; and
(3) Recent events have stressed the importance of local efforts to
maintain and protect the community's waterways; and
(4) The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is
moving forward with the implementation of the Chesapeake Bay
§ 11-4.13 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.14
AO:296
Tributary Strategy, which established aggressive goals for
reductions in the amount of sediments and nutrients such as
nitrogen and phosphorus; and
(5) Our local streams contribute to the Susquehanna River drainage
area and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay; and
(6) The potential exists for DEP to establish total maximum daily load
(TMDL) regulations in order to prevent further increased sediment
and nutrient loadings to our waterways; and
(7) If local measures such as riparian buffers are not evaluated and
implemented to reduce loadings to our streams, the community's
healthy economy and environmental well-being could be
permanently threatened; and
(8) The region is located at the top of the watershed, and, since there
are no upstream communities discharging nutrients and sediments
to our local waterways, their protection and preservation rests with
us; and
(9) These point to the need for a more coordinated effort at the local
municipal level to protect our streams and waterways; and
(10) The Centre Region municipalities have evaluated and taken the
opportunity to pursue the following riparian buffer measures that
will help to ensure the future health of our valuable water
resources. The implementation of a regional riparian buffer
program is an important step in our cooperative water
management efforts.
B. Legislative intent.
(1) Under the authority granted by Article I, Section 27, of the
Pennsylvania Constitution, Act 247, the Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended,106 and other commonwealth and federal
statutes, the following riparian buffer regulations have been
enacted to govern the restoration, conservation, disturbance and
management of riparian buffer areas in Harris Township.
(2) For purposes of this section, "riparian buffers" are defined as the
areas surrounding perennial and intermittent streams and
jurisdictional wetlands in Harris Township, whether identified by
the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) or U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and illustrated on the Harris Township Riparian Buffer
Map (Appendix A),107 or identified by the property owner at the
time of development through subdivision or land development
planning.
106. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
107. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 11-4.14 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.14
AO:297
(3) The specific purpose and intent of this section is to:
(a) Conserve, by natural processes (including filtration,
deposition, absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, and
denitrification), the natural features of riparian areas to reduce
the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter, pesticides,
and other harmful substances that reach watercourses,
wetlands, subsurface, and surface water bodies; regulate the
temperature of watercourses and surface water bodies; and
contribute to groundwater recharge.
(b) Improve and maintain the safety, reliability, and adequacy of
the Spring Creek Watershed's water resources.
C. Applicability.
(1) The riparian buffer regulations shall apply to all subdivisions and
land developments created after the date of this section that
contain an intermittent or perennial stream or jurisdictional
wetland as defined herein.
(2) Adoption of this section does not grant public access to private
property. Any grant of public access remains the prerogative of
each individual property owner.
(3) Within the riparian buffer, all existing zoning, land use, and
building regulations now in place shall continue to apply, except
where the regulations of this section are more restrictive.
(4) Riparian buffer mitigation is recommended, but not required, when
a building or zoning permit is needed for activities that do not
require subdivision or land development approval and that are
within or touching the riparian buffer area.
(5) This section shall not apply to the footprints of any existing primary
and accessory uses, including but not limited to all agricultural
uses and research related thereto, buildings, transportation
facilities, fences, lawns, gardens, utility lines, roads, driveways,
sidewalks, bikeways, decks, piers, water, septic and sewage supply
facilities and their related appurtenances (well houses, utility pump
and lift stations, manholes, etc.).
(6) Establishment, preservation and maintenance of riparian buffer
areas shall remain the sole responsibility of the individual property
owner.
D. Width determination/delineation.
(1) The measurement of the riparian buffer area shall extend a total
width of 50 feet from each defined edge of a perennial stream,
intermittent stream, or jurisdictional wetland, or shall equal the
extent of the one-hundred-year floodplain, whichever is greater.
§ 11-4.14 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.14
AO:298
(2) Subdivision and land development plans submitted to the Township
for approval shall clearly identify the riparian buffer areas or
include a note that there are no riparian buffer areas identified on
the property. This initial determination shall be subject to review
and approval by the Township.
(3) At the discretion of the property owner/developer, the riparian
buffer may be included as part of the proposed building lots, or the
riparian buffer may be a separate lot of record and designated as
open space.
(4) Within 30 days of final plan approval, but in any case prior to any
site development or disturbance, the property encompassing the
riparian buffer area shall be clearly delineated using fiberglass
boundary markers (Carsonite or the equivalent) placed at a
minimum of every 50 feet and extending a minimum of three feet
above ground.
(5) The fiberglass boundary markers shall clearly indicate "riparian
protection area."
(6) Where a riparian buffer area width reduction has been granted in
accordance with Subsection G of this section, the fiberglass
boundary markers shall be placed at the corners of the reduced
width areas, as well as along the riparian buffer boundary at the
minimum fifty-foot distance required in Subsection D(4).
(7) Riparian buffer area boundary markers shall remain in place for a
minimum of three years, the establishment period for new
plantings.
E. Uses permitted within the riparian buffer areas. Riparian buffer areas
are to be left in their natural state; however, the following uses, which
are primarily passive in character, may occur within the riparian buffer
area. Any use not authorized in this section shall be prohibited within
the riparian buffer area.
(1) Agricultural uses in compliance with the Pennsylvania Clean
Streams Law,108 specifically rules and regulations promulgated
under 25 Pa. Code Chapters 102 (erosion and sediment control)
and 91 (manure storage and management). Agricultural uses
include stream crossings for farm vehicles and/or livestock if part
of a federal, state and/or privately funded Centre County
Conservation District and/or local nonprofit riparian buffer
improvement project.
(2) Forestry uses, provided a Centre County Conservation District
approved erosion and sedimentation control plan has been
prepared and in accordance with the best management practices
108. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 11-4.14 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.14
AO:299
for forestry found in the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Chapter 93, Water Quality Standards.
(3) Removal of noxious or invasive species or removal of trees where
such removal is necessary as a means to eliminate dead, diseased
or hazardous stands of trees that jeopardize public safety, in
accordance with the best management practices for forestry found
in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's
Chapter 93, Water Quality Standards.
(4) Wildlife sanctuaries, nature preserves, nature trails, forest
preserves, fishing areas, passive areas of public and private
parklands.
(5) Stream bank stabilization, habitat enhancement and/or native
planting and native tree reforestation.
(6) Research and monitoring devices such as staff gages, water
recording, water quality testing, cross vanes, weirs and related
demonstration facilities.
(7) New stream crossings for roads, railroads, centralized sewer and/
or water lines and public utility transmission lines and/or their
related appurtenances (i.e., towers, well houses, pump and lift
stations), constructed in accordance with stream crossing
standards, as specified in Subsection J of this section.
F. Uses prohibited within the riparian buffer area. Any use not authorized
within Subsection E of this section shall be prohibited within the
riparian buffer area. Without limiting this general statement of
prohibition, the following activities and facilities are specifically
prohibited:
(1) Removal or disturbance of vegetation in a manner that is
inconsistent with erosion and sedimentation control and riparian
buffer protection.
(2) Changing the existing grade as a result of earth disturbance,
including cutting and filling.
(3) Storage of any hazardous or noxious materials, except those used
during emergencies for the treatment and/or maintenance of sewer
and water treatment facilities (i.e., generator sets and alternative
drive units).
(4) Use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and/or other chemicals in
excess of federally prescribed industry standards and/or the
recommendations of the Centre County Conservation District.
(5) Roads or driveways, except where permitted as stream crossings.
(6) Motor or wheeled vehicle traffic in any area not designed to
adequately accommodate the type and volume.
§ 11-4.14 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.14
AO:300
(7) Parking areas.
(8) Structures.
G. Buffer width reduction and mitigation.
(1) A property owner may petition the Board of Supervisors for a
reduction of the riparian buffer width requirements. Such request
must be accompanied by evidence that strict compliance cannot be
achieved because of unique circumstances of the property. The
Board of Supervisors shall consider the recommendation of the
Township Engineer prior to granting any request to reduce the
riparian buffer width; however, the minimum width of any riparian
buffer shall not be less than 35 feet at any one location, except at
approved stream bank crossings. Those areas having a minimum
total width of 35 feet (or less at approved stream crossings) shall
comprise no more than 50% of the entire buffer length of the
subject parcel.
(2) Should a reduction in the riparian buffer width be granted, the
Board of Supervisors shall require riparian buffer mitigation
elsewhere on the subject property. In such cases, mitigation of the
buffer area shall be at a 2:1 square foot replacement ratio.
(3) Mitigation shall be applied to each side of the stream
independently (i.e., if a property encompasses both sides of a
stream, buffer mitigation can be applied to both sides, but must be
independent of one another for purposes of calculating the size of
the mitigation area).
H. Waiver of the riparian buffer requirements.
(1) If any provisions of the riparian buffer regulations are found to be
unreasonable and cause undue or unnecessary hardship as they
apply to a proposed subdivision and/or land development plan, the
Board of Supervisors may waive the regulations in accordance with
§ 11-4.1A of this chapter. Waiver requests must be accompanied by
evidence that strict compliance cannot be achieved because of
unique circumstances of the property.
(2) A waiver of buffer requirements is prohibited in subdivisions and/or
land development plans that propose the following activities:
(a) Subsurface discharge from a wastewater treatment facility.
(b) Junkyards.
(c) Commercial or industrial storage and/or service of motor
vehicle facilities.
(d) Commercial storage tanks for fuel and fuel oil.
(e) Commercial greenhouses or landscape supply facilities.
§ 11-4.14 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-4.14
AO:301
(f) Commercial or public pools.
(g) Concentrated animal feed operations.
(h) Veterinary hospitals, commercial kennels and/or similar
operations.
I. Riparian buffer mitigation.
(1) All subdivision and land development plans submitted to the
Township shall clearly illustrate the riparian buffer area or include
a note indicating that there is no riparian buffer area on the subject
property.
(2) Riparian buffer areas which remain in their natural state or comply
with the permitted uses identified in Subsection E of this section
are exempt from buffer mitigation; however, earth disturbance
activities proposed for a subdivision or land development must
comply with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
erosion and sedimentation control regulations (25 Pa. Code
Chapter 102).
(3) Subdivisions and land developments that propose activity involving
grading, tilling, digging or filling of ground or stripping of
vegetation or other activity that causes an alteration to the natural
condition of the land within or touching a riparian buffer area shall
be required to illustrate on the plan the scope of the disturbance to
the riparian buffer area. Mitigation of the disturbed area of the
riparian buffer is required at a 1:1 square foot ratio, in accordance
with the following specifications:
(a) Existing plantings intended to be counted toward mitigation of
riparian buffer disturbance shall be clearly illustrated on
subdivision or land development plan submissions.
(b) Riparian buffer mitigation plantings must include at least four
tree species and two shrub species from the list included in
Appendix B,109 adapted from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Stream ReLeaf Program for
Pennsylvania Native Riparian Tree/Shrub Plant Selection.
Plantings shall occur prior to April 15 or after leaf fall in the
autumn. Plantings shall include a mix of species at a rate of
100 to 125 containerized or ball and burlap trees and shrubs
per acre at approximately twenty-foot by twenty-foot spacing
or 400 bare root trees and shrubs per acre at approximately
ten-foot by ten-foot spacing.
(c) A survival rate of at least 70% after three years is required for
any trees or shrubs planted in the riparian buffer area.
Replanting may be necessary during the three-year period, but
109. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 11-4.14 HARRIS CODE § 11-4.14
AO:302
in any case shall be required at the end of the third growing
season following planting to meet the 70% overall survival rate
requirement.
(d) Riparian buffer mitigation plantings and their location within
the buffer area shall be evaluated to verify their ability to
relieve the effects of any proposed disturbance within the
riparian buffer area. Any mitigation shall identify the existing
conditions (vegetation, floodplain, wetlands, soils, slopes, etc.),
all proposed activities, and, if applicable, any proposed
management techniques.
J. Stream crossing standards. All stream crossings permitted under
Subsection E of this section shall comply with and incorporate the
following minimum standards:
(1) Stream crossings requiring any activity in, under and/or over any
body of water shall first consult the Department of Environmental
Protection's North Central Regional Office, Watershed
Management Permitting and Technical Services Section, or other
appropriate office designated by DEP.
(2) The width of any right-of-way shall not be greater than the
minimum right-of-way width required by this chapter.
(3) Stream crossings shall be designed to cross at direct right angles to
minimize disturbance to the riparian buffer area.
(4) Stream crossings on the same property shall be separated by a
minimum of 1,000 feet of stream length.
(5) Bridges, with the appropriate federal and/or state permits, shall be
used in place of culverts when crossings would require a seventytwo-
inch or greater diameter pipe. When culverts are installed,
they shall consist of slab, arch or box culverts and not corrugated
metal pipe. Culvert bottoms shall be depressed in accordance with
Department of Environmental Protection regulations to allow for
the natural flow of water through the culvert during low-flow or
dry-weather periods.
(6) Any disturbance to the riparian buffer as a result of a stream
crossing shall be mitigated at a ratio of 1:1 for each square foot of
disturbance, in accordance with the riparian buffer mitigation
specifications found in Subsection I of this section. Such mitigation
shall occur immediately adjacent to the stream crossing.

Land Development Transportation Impact Reports
[Added 10-9-1995 by Ord. No. 169]
§ 11-7.1. Transportation impact report requirements.
A. Study threshold.
(1) A transportation impact report shall be required for any subdivision
or land development projected to generate at least 500 trip ends
per day. The projected number of trip ends will be determined
through use of the unit trip-end values presented in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, as
amended, multiplied by the size of the proposed development.
Planning staff will determine the appropriate ITE land use category
to be used for a proposed development.
(2) A transportation impact report may also be required due to a
localized safety or capacity deficiency, such as but not limited to the
following:
(a) Current traffic problems in the local area, such as a highaccident
location; confusing intersection, signage or
geometries; or an intersection in need of additional traffic
signals.
(b) The sensitivity of the adjacent neighborhoods or other land
areas that may be impacted.
(c) The proximity of existing or proposed driveways to other
nearby driveways or intersections.
(d) The ability of the adjacent, existing, or planned roadway
system to handle increased traffic; or the feasibility of
improving the roadway system to handle increased traffic.
(e) Other specific problems or deficiencies that may be affected by
the proposed development or affect the ability of the
development to be satisfactorily accommodated.
B. Study content. The extent and scope of a proposed transportation
impact report shall be relative to the size and location of the proposed
development. The costs of preparing such report shall be borne by the
land developer. The delineation of the study area, required data
collection effort, and required analyses will be determined by Harris
Township staff and the developer's consultant. The report shall include
the following, as a minimum:
(1) A description of existing conditions and traffic volumes for the road
network within the study area.
§ 11-7.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-7.1
AO:315
(2) An analysis which shall describe existing levels of service; analysis
and description of projected traffic conditions based on the land
uses proposed within the development at build-out; trip generation
rates for morning and evening peak hours of the project; and
internal/external site trip distribution and intersection analyses.
(3) The report shall evaluate the traffic impacts of the proposed
development and identify the need for road, access and traffic
control improvements as a result of the proposed development.
(4) The analysis shall describe recommended internal, adjacent, and
off-site road improvements. The developer must construct all onsite
improvements. These recommended improvements should be
specific as to location and scope of work required and include a
phased schedule for implementation. Examples of additional items
that should be included in this section are:
(a) Typical cross sections for each category of street.
(b) A phasing plan that identifies the street improvements during
the construction of each development phase.
(5) Evaluation of alternate modes of transportation shall be included in
the traffic impact analysis. Evaluation of traffic mitigation
measures as they relate to public transportation, future site
development, and land use configurations should also be
addressed.

that co-location on an existing tower-based WCF or
other wireless support structure is not technically
possible in order to serve the desired need;
[b] Planned equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of existing towers within the Township,
considering existing and planned use of those towers
and existing towers cannot be reinforced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a
reasonable cost;
[c] Planned equipment will cause radio frequency (RF)
interference with other existing or planned equipment
for that tower and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost;
[d] Existing or approved tower-based WCF or wireless
support structures do not have the space on which
planned equipment can be placed so it can function
§ 12-2.4 HARRIS CODE § 12-2.4
AO:338
effectively and at least in parity with other similar
equipment in place or planned; and/or
[e] Other reasons can be demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Township that make it impractical to place the
equipment planned by the applicant on existing and
approved towers.

(h) Procedure.
[1] Conditional use authorization required for tower-based
WCFs both inside and outside the public rights-of-way.
[a] Tower-based WCFs are permitted in certain areas by
conditional use, at a height necessary to satisfy their
function in the applicant's wireless communications
system. No applicant shall have the right under these
regulations to erect a tower to the maximum height
specified in this section unless it proves the necessity
for such height. The applicant shall demonstrate that
the antenna/tower/pole for the tower-based WCF is
the minimum height necessary for the service area. In
addition to all other Township procedures and
requirements necessary for the conditional use
process, the applicant shall demonstrate the
following:
[i] Prior to the Board's approval of a conditional use
authorizing the construction and installation of
tower-based WCFs, it shall be incumbent upon the
applicant for such conditional use approval to
prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board
that the applicant cannot adequately extend or
infill its communications system by the use of
equipment such as redoes, repeaters, antennas
and other similar equipment installed on existing
structures, such as utility poles, wireless support
structures, and other available tall structures. The
applicant shall further demonstrate that the
proposed tower-based WCF must be located
where it is proposed in order to serve the
applicant's service area and that no other viable
alternative location exists.
[ii] The conditional use application shall be
accompanied by a propagation study evidencing
the need for the proposed tower or other
communication facilities and equipment, a
description of the type and manufacturer of the
proposed transmission/radio equipment, the
§ 12-2.4 HARRIS CODE § 12-2.4
AO:346
frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to
the applicant, the power in watts at which the
applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests
conducted by the applicant in determining the
need for the proposed site and installation.
[iii] The conditional use application shall be
accompanied by documentation demonstrating
that the proposed tower-based WCF complies
with all state and federal laws and regulations
concerning aviation safety.
[iv] Where the tower-based WCF is located on a
property with another principal use, and not sited
in the public rights-of-way, the applicant shall
present documentation to the Board of
Supervisors that the owner of the property has
granted an easement for the proposed WCF and
that vehicular access will be provided to the
facility.
[v] The conditional use application shall be
accompanied by documentation demonstrating
that the proposed tower-based WCF complies
with all applicable provisions in the Township
Zoning Code, and the applicant has fulfilled all
requirements related to the siting and installation
of the proposed facility.
[b] To the extent permitted by state and federal law,
applications for the placement of nontower WCFs only
require zoning and building permits pursuant to the
application and approval procedures for such.
Nontower WCFs located inside the public right-of-way
shall require a road occupancy permit from the
Township.
[2] Use of right-of-way. In additional to all other applicable
regulations enumerated in this chapter, the following
regulations shall apply to those WCFs located within a
public right-of-way:
[a] Compensation for ROW use. In addition to the
applicable permit fees, every WCF in the Township
ROW is subject to the Township's right to fix annually
a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid for use
and occupancy of the ROW. Such compensation for
ROW use shall be directly related to the Township's
actual ROW management costs, including, but not
limited to, the costs of the administration and
performance of all reviewing, inspecting, permitting,
§ 12-2.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-2.4
AO:347
supervising and other ROW management activities by
the Township. The owner of each WCF in the ROW
shall pay an annual fee to the Township to compensate
the Township for the Township's costs incurred in
connection with the activities described above. The
annual ROW management fee for nontower WCFs
shall be determined by the Township and authorized
by resolution of the Harris Township Board of
Supervisors and shall be based on the Township's
actual ROW management costs as applied to such
WCF.
[b] Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days
following written notice from the Township, or such
longer period as the Township determines is
reasonably necessary, or such other period in the case
of an emergency, an owner of a WCF in the ROW shall,
at its own expense, temporarily or permanently
remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
WCF when the Township, consistent with its police
powers and applicable Public Utility Commission
regulations, shall have determined that such a
removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary under the following circumstances:
[i] The construction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any Township or other public
improvement in the right-of-way;
[ii] The operations of the Township or other
governmental entity in the right-of-way;
[iii] Vacation of a street or road or the release of a
utility easement; or
[iv] An emergency as determined by the Township.

181; 4-13-2009 by Ord. No. 284]
A. Identified area; effect on other provisions; zoning permits.
(1) The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Harris
Township, subject to the one-hundred-year flood, which is identified
as Zone A (Area of Special Flood Hazard) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) dated May 4, 2009, and the accompanying maps or the
most recent revision thereof as issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, including all digital data developed as part of
the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) This section supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may
be in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other
ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any
conflict between any of the provisions of this section, the more
restrictive shall apply.
(3) Zoning permits shall be required before any construction or
development is undertaken within floodplain area of the Township.
B. Description of floodplain areas.
(1) The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(a) FW (Floodway Area): the areas identified as "Floodway" in the
AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the FEMA.
The term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
(b) FF (Flood-Fringe Area): the remaining portions of the onehundred-
year floodplain in those areas identified as an AE
Zone in the Flood Insurance study, where a floodway has been
delineated. The basis for the outermost boundary of this area
shall be the one-hundred-year flood elevations as shown in the
flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
(c) FE (Special Floodplain Area): the areas identified as Zone AE
in the Flood Insurance Study, where one-hundred-year flood
elevations have been provided, but no floodway has been
delineated.
§ 12-7.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-7.1
AO:383
(d) FA (General Floodplain Area): the areas identified as Zone A in
the FIS for which no one-hundred-year flood elevations have
been provided. When available, information from other federal,
state, and other acceptable sources shall be used to determine
the one-hundred-year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. When no other information is available, the onehundred-
year elevation shall be determined by using a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest
the construction site in question.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Township.
(3) Within any FW (Floodway Area), the following provisions apply:
(a) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
(b) Space below the lowest floor.
[1] Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (including
basement) is prohibited.
[2] Partially enclosed space below the lowest floor is
prohibited.
(c) No variances shall be granted by the Harris Township Zoning
Hearing Board for any development in the floodway that would
result in increased flood heights.
(4) Within any FE (Special Floodplain Area), no new construction or
development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the elevation of the one-hundred-year flood more than one
foot at any point.
(5) Within any identified floodplain area, any new construction or
substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure shall have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to, or above, the
one-hundred-year flood elevation, or be designed and constructed
so that the space enclosed by such structure shall remain either
completely or essentially dry during any flood up to that height.
§ 12-7.1 HARRIS CODE § 12-7.1
AO:384
(6) Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, having a lowest floor
which is not elevated up to, or above, the one-hundred-year flood
elevation, shall be floodproofed in a completely or essentially dry
manner in accordance with the W1 or W2 space classification
standards contained in the publication entitled "Flood-Proofing
Regulations" published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (June
1972, as amended March 1992) or with some other equivalent
standard. All plans and specifications for such floodproofing shall
be accompanied by a statement certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect which states that the proposed
design and methods of construction are in conformance with the
above-referenced standards.
C. Permitted uses. Floodplains may only be used for the following,
provided such uses do not conflict with the limitations of Subsection D
below:

(a) To determine the amount of landscape plantings to be provided
within the front, side and rear yard areas, the buffer yard
provisions of Table 1 of Chapter 12, which establishes land use
classifications and associated required plantings, shall be
utilized. For the purposes of applying these buffer yard
requirements, arterial roadways shall be considered a Class IV
land use. Existing trees may be preserved and counted toward
the required buffer yard plantings.
(b) Any trees planted in required buffer yards must be warranted
for a three-year period, meaning those that die must be
replaced with trees meeting the standards contained herein.
(2) Landscape islands. Raised landscape islands shall be installed
within all off-street parking areas in the COD. One raised island
shall be required for every 10 parking spaces. Each landscape
island shall be equal to the length and width of a standard parking
space and shall contain two canopy shade trees in a minimum of
two-and-one-half-inch caliper measured 12 inches above ground
level.
(3) Tree preservation.

by Ord. No. 277]
H. If fencing and lighting are included with the site plan, they must be
shown on the plan.
A. Zero lot line dwellings, as defined in Article XI, are permitted in the
Single-Family Residential District and in the rural zoning districts when
utilizing the open space - rural clustering regulations.
B. Zero lot line dwellings shall be subject to the following regulations:
(1) One side yard setback shall be zero, with the other side yard
conforming to the district regulations for side yards.
(2) Zero lot line dwellings shall be configured so as to adjoin common
zero side yard setbacks.
A. The Ridge Overlay District requirements are intended to provide land
use and land use development controls along specified ridge corridors
in the Township as an overlay that is supplemental to the underlying
Forest Zoning District regulations. If a conflict exists between the
regulations of this section and the underlying zoning district
regulations, the more restrictive section requirements shall apply.
B. Intent. [Amended 7-11-2011 by Ord. No. 295]
(1) The parcels located within the overlay zone are identified as having
slopes of 15% or greater and/or soils which are considered colluvial
in nature. These soils may include the following: Andover (AnB,
AnC, AoB, AoC), Buchanan (BuC, BxB, BxD) or Laidig (LaD, LcB,
LcD, LDF) or colluvial soils rated by the National Resources
Conservation Service's (NRCS) Web Soil Survey as being "Very
Limited" for uses such as septic tank absorption fields, habitable
structures with basements, and local roads and streets. A rating of
"Very Limited" by the Web Soil Survey indicates that the soil has
one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The
limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil
reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures.
Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected. The
limitations associated with the colluvial soils include a seasonal
high (perched) water tables, hydric soils, fragipan, soil instability,
steep slopes, slow permeability, large and/or excessive stones, and
frost action.
(2) It is the intent of the Ridge Overlay District requirements set forth
hereinafter to restrict the intensity of development on areas
containing slopes of 15% or greater and/or colluvial soils with
severe limitations, and:
§ 12-7.11 HARRIS CODE § 12-7.13
AO:412
(a) To identify the location of the most severe soil areas where
development is not appropriate;
(b) To minimize the potential for damage from erosion,
sedimentation, landslide and flooding;
(c) To protect the property of the Township and future
homeowners from adverse conditions; and
(d) To protect and retain natural resources, especially surface
water and groundwater resources within the Township.
C. Delineation of Ridge Overlay District. The Ridge Overlay District
requirements shall be applied in the areas depicted on the Official
Zoning Map for Harris Township. This includes all lands located within
the Forest Zoning District with slopes of 15% or greater and/or
underlying colluvial soils, as identified by the NRCS's Web Soil Survey.
D. Site plan review. A site plan, as described by Article IX, shall accompany
all applications for zoning permits for lots, uses, and structures located
in whole or in part on land located within the Ridge Overlay District.
Site plans must also include soils mapping information based on the
NRCS's Web Soil Survey.
E. Septic system approval. As part of the soils testing for the entire site,
the testing for septic systems must be accomplished. The septic
systems must be approved by the Township's Sewage Enforcement
Officer in conformity with the rules, policies, regulations and
specifications of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
F. Federal and state permits. It is recommended that the need for any
federal and state permits be investigated, and that such permits be
obtained, prior to moving forward with any development plans within
the overlay district.
G. Criteria for erection of habitable structure on existing lots. For the
construction of a habitable structure on a lot existing at the time of
adoption of these regulations, and when no subdivision or land
development is proposed or required, the following criteria shall apply:
[Amended 7-11-2011 by Ord. No. 295]
(1) The site plan, as per Subsection D, must identify the location of all
colluvial soils and slopes of 15% or greater as well as delineate the
portion of the lot which encompasses the buildable area, which
shall be considered the same as the area of potential land
disturbance that includes the footprint of the structure and any
accessory structure or outbuilding, the access, and, if necessary,
the on-lot disposal system.
(2) In addition, a note must be placed on the plan which will alert
future homeowners to the potential for sinkholes, flooding and
drainage issues, as well as the possibility for development of the lot
§ 12-7.13 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-7.13
AO:413
to require special design or construction considerations to mitigate
the limitations imposed by the soils and/or slopes.
(3) Perennial and intermittent streams. No land disturbance which
would involve the construction of a habitable structure or the
installation of a driveway which is used for access to a habitable
structure may occur within 50 feet of a perennial or intermittent
stream. Since some perennial or intermittent streams may have the
capacity to carry substantially more runoff than others, the
required separation distance may be reduced as a result of a
hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each specific site
and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal permits
associated with the proposed construction activity.
(4) Floodplain. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of a habitable structure or the installation of a
driveway which is used for access to a habitable structure may
occur within 50 feet of the edge of a floodplain or the floodplain
conservation district as defined by the Flood Hazard Boundary Map
for Harris Township prepared by the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. This
distance may be reduced for areas where there is a minimum fivepercent
rise between the edge of the floodplain and the area of
earth disturbance. Where such reduction in distance is desired,
information shall be provided to assure that an adequate
separation has been provided. All land located within a floodplain
or wetland shall also be subject to the regulations of § 12-7.1.
(5) Sinkholes. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of a habitable structure or the installation of a
driveway which is used for access to a habitable structure may
occur within 50 feet of the edge of the sinkhole. If there is a
drainage channel leading to the sinkhole, a minimum of 50 feet on
all sides of the drainage channel shall be protected.
(6) Slope and soils. Land disturbance which would involve the
construction of a habitable structure or the installation of a
driveway which is used for access to a habitable structure shall
minimize impacts on soils defined as colluvial in this chapter. All
land defined as having steep slopes of 25% or greater shall be
subject to the regulations found in § 12-7.2.
(7) Springs. No land disturbance which involves the construction of a
habitable structure or the installation of a driveway which is used
for access to a habitable structure may occur within 50 feet of a
defined spring. This required separation distance may be reduced
as the result of a hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each
specific site and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal
permits associated with the proposed development activity.
§ 12-7.13 HARRIS CODE § 12-7.13
AO:414
(8) Wetlands. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of a habitable structure or the installation of a
driveway which is used for access to a habitable structure may
occur within 50 feet of the edge of a defined wetland area as
established by this chapter, DEP, and/or the Army Corps of
Engineers. This distance may be reduced, if necessary; when the
appropriate permits from these state and federal agencies are
obtained. Where such reduction in separation distance is desired,
information shall be submitted that substantiates the need to
reduce the separation distance as well as the endorsement of the
permitting agencies.
(9) Wooded areas. The removal of healthy trees on the site shall be
minimized to the greatest extent practicable. Existing wooded
areas shall be protected to prevent unnecessary destruction or
removal of healthy trees with a minimum trunk caliper of five
inches at six inches above ground level.
(10) Excavation and fill. No excavation or fill that will cause any slope to
become unstable; impose loads that may affect the safety of
structures or slopes; interfere with adequate drainage for the site
area and the drainage area of land tributary to the site; obstruct,
damage, or adversely affect existing sewerage or drainage; cause a
stagnant pond of water to form; or cause erosion or sedimentation
shall be permitted.
(11) The site plan as detailed in Subsection D shall include soils
mapping as per NRCS's Web Soil Survey or the Centre County Soil
Survey for the entire site. The Township Engineer or his/her
designated agent shall review the soils report within the context of
the regulations and guidelines for construction specified in this
chapter to determine whether the proposed disturbance minimizes
impact to the greatest extent practicable to allow for the
construction of one habitable structure. The Township Engineer's
decision may be appealed by the applicant to the Zoning Hearing
Board.
H. Criteria for subdivision and land development in the Ridge Overlay
District. The following criteria will determine the ability to, and
establish the process for subdivision and land development in the Ridge
Overlay District: [Added 7-11-2011 by Ord. No. 295]
(1) No new building lots may be created after the date of enactment of
this subsection which do not encompass sufficient buildable area to
comply with the applicable provisions of Subsection H(3) through
(11). The buildable area shall be considered the same as the area of
potential land disturbance and includes the footprint of the
structure and any accessory structure or out building, the access,
and if necessary, the on-lot disposal system as well as suitable land
necessary to accommodate the required replacement area for the
on-lot disposal system.
§ 12-7.13 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-7.13
AO:415
(2) The subdivision plan for any lots which are created must identify
the location of all colluvial soils and slopes of 15% or greater within
the proposed lot, as well as delineate that portion of the lot which
encompasses the buildable area. In addition, a note must be placed
on the plan which will alert future homeowners to the potential for
sinkholes, flooding and drainage issues, as well as the possibility
for development of the lot to require special design or construction
considerations to mitigate the limitations imposed by the soils and/
or slopes. Where sinkholes are included on acreage designated as
part of a newly subdivided lot, it is recommended that such areas
be fenced for safety.
(3) Perennial/intermittent streams. No land disturbance which would
involve the construction of a habitable structure or the installation
of a paved driveway or construction of a road or roads which are
used for access to a habitable structure or structures, may occur
within 50 feet of a defined drainageway. Some drainageways may
have the capacity to carry substantially more runoff than others.
Therefore, the required separation distance may be reduced as the
result of a hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each
specific site and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal
permits associated with the proposed development activity.
(4) Floodplain. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a habitable structure or structures may occur within 50
feet of the edge of a floodplain or the floodplain conservation
district as defined by the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for Harris
Township prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration,
Federal Emergency Management Agency. This distance may be
reduced for areas where there is a minimum five-percent rise
between the edge of the floodplain and the area of earth
disturbance. Where such reduction in distance is desired,
information shall be provided to assure that an adequate
separation has been provided. All land located within a floodplain
or wetlands shall also be subject to the regulations of § 12-7.1.
(5) Sinkholes. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a habitable structure or structures may occur within 50
feet of the edge of the sinkhole. If there is a drainage path leading
to the sinkhole, a minimum of 50 feet on all sides of the drainage
channel shall be protected.
(6) Slope and soils. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a habitable structure or structures shall occur within 50
feet downgrade of any area with a slope of 15% or more and/or that
§ 12-7.13 HARRIS CODE § 12-7.13
AO:416
is comprised of colluvial soils. All land defined as having steep
slopes of 25% or greater shall be subject to the regulations found
in § 12-7.2. Land disturbance which would involve the construction
of a habitable structure or the installation of a driveway which is
used for access to a habitable structure shall minimize impacts on
soils defined as colluvial in this chapter.
(7) Springs. No land disturbance which involves the construction of
habitable structures, the installation of paved driveways and/or
construction of a road or roads which are used for access to a
habitable structure or structures may occur within 50 feet of a
defined spring. This required separation distance may be reduced
as the result of a hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each
specific site and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal
permits associated with the proposed development activity.
(8) Wetlands. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures, the installation of paved
driveways and/or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a habitable structure or structures may occur within 50
feet of the edge of a defined wetland area as established by this
chapter, DEP, and/or the Army Corps of Engineers. This distance
may be reduced, if necessary, when the appropriate permits from
these state and federal agencies are obtained. Where such
reduction in separation distance is desired, information shall be
submitted that substantiates the need to reduce the separation
distance as well as the endorsement of the permitting agencies.
(9) Wooded areas. At least 25% of healthy trees on the site shall be
maintained or replaced immediately following construction.
Replacement trees shall have a minimum trunk caliper of two
inches at a height of six inches above finished grade. Existing
wooded areas shall be protected to prevent unnecessary
destruction or removal of healthy trees with a minimum trunk
caliper of five inches at six inches above ground. Where significant
removal of trees within an existing wooded area is anticipated,
plans shall be required to be provided.
(10) Excavation and fill. No excavation or fill that will cause any slope to
become unstable; impose loads that may affect the safety of
structures or slopes; interfere with adequate drainage for the site
area and the drainage area of land tributary to the site; obstruct,
damage, or adversely affect existing sewerage or drainage; cause a
stagnant pond of water to form; or cause erosion or sedimentation
shall be permitted.
(11) Soils report and evaluation. Any property or site within the overlay
district mapped with or potentially containing colluvial soils rated
as Very Limited must be evaluated prior to being permitted for the
land disturbance activities noted above. While the NCRS's Web Soil
Survey may be used as a resource, on-site soils evaluation and soil
§ 12-7.13 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-7.13
AO:417
test pits will be required to determine the actual soil distribution
on each site.
(a) In order to accomplish the soils evaluation, the developer must
meet with the Township's Engineer or his/her designated agent
to determine, at a minimum, the location, number and type of
soil test pits that will provide a representative sample of the
soils present within the area intended to be disturbed.
Consensus on the number of test pits will be reached based on
the landowner's development intentions, soil mapping units
delineated in the NRCS's Web Soil Survey, the location of
natural features on the site, and any previous soil test results.
(b) The on-site soils assessment and report preparation must be
completed by a qualified soil scientist or registered
professional geologist with the appropriate experience in soil
science interpretation, subject to approval by the Township
Engineer or his/her designated agent. The results must then be
submitted for review and approval by the Township's Engineer
or his/her designated agent. This municipal review will
determine the adequacy of the soils evaluation to determine
the development potential/buildable area of the parcel.
(c) The soils assessment report will provide the data necessary to
prepare a detailed soils map of the site that will allow the
applicant to determine the potential to provide roads,
driveways and/or structures in accordance with these
regulations. The Township Engineer or his/her designated
agent shall review the soils report within the context of the
regulations and guidelines for development specified in this
subsection to determine whether there is sufficient buildable
area to develop and to identify additional conditions of
development, if necessary.
(d) For those properties or sites where the above required soils
assessment report definitively indicates that the proposed land
disturbance activities will not be impacted by the location of
colluvial soils, the remainder of the requirements of this
district shall not be applicable.
I. Criteria for land accessed across colluvial soils. In many cases, access
to an area that is developable may not be possible without crossing
colluvial soils. In such cases, the following requirements shall apply:
[Amended 7-11-2011 by Ord. No. 295]
(1) Low-impact driveway or roadway design, in accordance with the
recognized standards acceptable to the Township Engineer, shall
be used.
(2) The proposed location and design of the access shall provide the
least practicable disturbance to the colluvial soils in the area.
§ 12-7.13 HARRIS CODE § 12-7.13
AO:418
(3) The access is located in conformance with the setback restrictions
associated with wetlands, floodplains, sinkholes, springs,
drainageways, and watercourses as referenced above or, where
such setbacks cannot be met, evidence that the location and design
of the access is not adversely impacted by its proximity to such
features shall be provided.
J. Criteria where little or no buildable area is available on existing lots.
Where an existing lot contains little or no buildable area as a result of
this section, the design of any proposed structure must be engineered
by a licensed, professional engineer or architect to overcome the
limiting properties of the soils. The following land uses are permitted:
[Amended 7-11-2011 by Ord. No. 295]
(1) Habitable structure, provided that:
(a) There are no habitable structures currently existing on the
property;
(b) The land disturbance (which shall include the footprint of the
structure, the access, the primary and replacement areas for
on-lot sewage disposal) and the impervious coverage does not
exceed 50,000 square feet;
(c) The proposed location and design of the habitable structure
and access provide the least practicable disturbance to the
colluvial soils in the area;
(d) The proposal is consistent with the minimum lot size
requirement specified for the Forest Zoning District;
(e) Any increased maintenance required to ensure the longevity of
the structural integrity of the habitable structure and the onlot
septic system is identified and a written maintenance plan
is provided;
(f) The proposed construction will occur in conformance with the
setback restrictions associated with wetlands, floodplains,
sinkholes, springs, drainageways, and watercourses as
referenced above or, where such setbacks cannot be met,
evidence that the location of such construction is not adversely
impacted by its proximity to such features;
(g) The applicant shall provide a hold-harmless agreement and
indemnification in favor of the Township for any damage that
may occur to the structure or any other private property as a
result of the presence of colluvial soils.
(2) Forestry uses.
(3) Private passive park and recreational areas that do not include any
habitable structures.
§ 12-7.13 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-7.13
AO:419
(4) Horticultural and agricultural uses related to the tilling of the land,
the raising and propagation of crops, trees, shrubs, flowers, fruits
and vegetables, and other plant materials.
(5) Public or private conservation areas for the conservation of open
space, water soil, and wildlife resource.

ARTICLE VIII
Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots of Record
§ 12-8.1. Intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to recognize the right of nonconformities to
continue, but to encourage that such lots, uses, and structures be brought
into conformity with this chapter as soon as constitutionally permissible. To
achieve this end, nonconformities are subject to the regulations set forth in
this article.
§ 12-8.2. Nonconforming lots of record.
§ 12-8.3. Nonconforming uses and structures.
Where a lawful use or structure exists which, on the effective date of
this chapter or subsequent amendment thereto, becomes nonconforming,
such use or structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful, including subsequent sales of the property, subject to the following
provisions:
A. In any district in which dwellings are permitted as primary uses, a
single-family detached dwelling and customary accessory uses may be
erected on any single nonconforming lot of record at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such nonconforming lot
must be in separate ownership and not abut other lots under the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area and/or width that are applicable in the
district; provided that all other yard dimensions and requirements of
the lot shall conform to the regulations for single-family detached
dwellings in the Single-Family Residential District. Variance of yard
setback requirements may be obtained only through action of the
Zoning Hearing Board.
B. If two or more abutting lots or combinations of abutting lots and
portions of lots under the same ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements established for either lot width or area, the
lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with either lot width or
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with either width or area below
the requirements stated in this chapter.
C. Lots which fail to meet either minimum width or area requirements may
be expanded to include abutting lots under the same ownership.
A. The existing nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different
nonconforming use.
§ 12-8.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-8.3
AO:421
§ 12-8.4. Registration of nonconforming uses and structures.
In order to administer this article, the Zoning Officer shall identify and
register nonconforming uses and structures.
§ 12-8.5. New construction.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure on
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual constructions, provided that work shall be carried
on diligently.
B. No such nonconforming use or structure shall be altered or extended
except if such complies with the following criteria and standards:
(1) To provide for a natural expansion which is not detrimental to
public health, safety, and general welfare, provided such expansion
does not exceed 50% of the existing ground floor area of the
structure or other space occupied by the use.
(2) Provided such does not constitute the addition of a new
nonconforming use or structure.
(3) Provided such does not decrease yards when such already fail to
meet minimum yard setback areas.
(4) Provided that the alteration or extension meets the district
regulations for such use or structure as if same were being altered
or extended in the district where such use is permitted. In cases
where the use is permitted in two or more districts, the most
restrictive district regulations shall apply.
C. In the event that any nonconforming structure is destroyed or partially
destroyed by any means to an extent of 75% or more of the replacement
value less depreciation of such structure immediately preceding the
casualty, such nonconforming structure and use thereof shall terminate
and the lot shall thereafter be used only for conforming uses and
structures.
D. When a nonconforming use or structure is discontinued or abandoned
for a period of one year or more continuously, or replaced by a
conforming structure, the premises shall not thereafter be used except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located,
except if the use is a farm use as herein defined.

1-28-2015 by Ord. No. 314]
(1) Building areas shall be designed so as to require a certain minimum
separation, as defined more specifically below, between building
lots or areas. Such separation may be accomplished by creating
§ 12-15.3 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 12-15.4
AO:483
setbacks in individual lots, sufficiently separating building lot or
unit boundaries from one another, or any other acceptable method
that guarantees these minimum separation distances between
building lots or areas.
(a) Road and street separation. The development shall be laid out
so that no building lots or areas could be constructed within
the following distances from the following types of streets and
rights-of-way:
Type of Building
Local and
Collector
(feet)
Arterial
(feet)
Single-family
dwellings

F. Height. The height of all buildings within 200 feet of the boundary of
the planned residential development shall not exceed the maximum
height permitted in the adjoining residential district. When the building
is located within 200 feet of more than one adjoining zoning district, the
height shall not exceed the lowest maximum height allowed in either
district. The Township may allow higher buildings beyond 200 feet from
the perimeter if the property owner/developer can demonstrate that
such will not create any adverse impact on adjoining lands. The lowest
maximum height of the Village District shall be followed when any PRD
is located adjacent to the Village District either along the zone
boundary and/or a street.
G. Perimeter requirements. The planned residential development shall be
designed to avoid adverse influences and impacts on surrounding
properties.
(1) Residential structures located adjacent to the perimeter boundary
within the planned residential development may be required to

within planned residential developments shall conform to the
buffer setback and buffer yard requirements of § 12-2.6K, Buffer
yards.
(3) Additional buffer yards may be required where the planned
residential development is adjacent to existing dwellings or
neighborhoods. If the buffer yard ordinances governing the
adjacent uses and area are more stringent, those are to be applied
to the PRD perimeter.
A. Thirty percent of the total tract size is to serve as common open space.
Fifty percent of the common open space is to consist of parkland.
(1) Acceptable parkland is to consist of active and passive sites that
meet the general design characteristics described in § 11-4.12,
Parkland dedication requirements; fee-in-lieu option.

wetlands, steep slopes, water well protection sites, areas of
sinkholes, rock outcroppings, streams, and other sensitive natural
features. As a component of the PRD for the duration of the PRD,
access easements, scenic easements, and other easements over
private property of the PRD may serve as common open space. The
buildable areas of lots, public rights-of-way, and normal setback
areas are not included as common open space. Private golf courses
are a separate use under § 12-15.3B(6), and are not counted toward
parkland, or common open space, unless such is accessible to PRD
residents and is open to the public.
B. All land shown on the final development plan as parkland or open space
shall be conveyed in any of the following ways, at the discretion of the
Board of Supervisors:

Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter, nonstructural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site, stormwater structures, facilities and
techniques to maintain or improve the water quality of surface runoff.

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management Requirements
§ 13-3.1. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in the Township which do not fall under the
exemption criteria shown in § 13-1.8 of this chapter shall submit a
stormwater management site plan to the Township for review. This plan
must be consistent with the Spring Creek Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan. These criteria shall apply to the total proposed
development even if development is to take place in phases. Impervious
cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway
areas, and any new streets and sidewalks. Any areas designed to
initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious
for the purposes of comparison to the waiver criteria. The DEP
Stormwater BMP Manual, as amended and updated, shall be used for
design of stormwater management facilities. No disturbance may be
performed prior to approval of a stormwater management site plan. All
activities (especially earth disturbance activities) must comply with this
chapter, Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams
Law.151
B. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
(1) Stormwater management facilities and related installations also
shall be provided:
(a) To ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the
curbline of streets.
(b) To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained,
and to prevent substantial flow of water across intersections or
flooded intersections during storms, in accordance with the
procedures contained in Design Manual Part 2 (DM-2),
Chapter 10, of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PA DOT).
(c) To ensure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under
driveways in, near, or across natural watercourses or drainage
swales. Suitable pipes or other waterways shall be provided as
necessary.
(d) To properly drain stormwater runoff from all land development
projects, except as required by recharge criteria. All lot and
open areas shall be designed to drain to the nearest practical
151. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 13-3.1 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.1
AO:517
street or drainage system, existing or proposed, as defined by
the Township Engineer, with no impact on adjoining properties,
unless an area specifically designed for stormwater detention
is provided.
C. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the altered
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge
criteria specified in this chapter.
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge. If, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, there will be an
impact on the downstream adjacent property, the Township may require
that the developer obtain a stormwater easement. Where a
development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage easements
shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures, and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of
stormwater within any portion of the easement. Developers are
encouraged to allow stormwater easements to revert to a natural
condition. Mowing or similar types of vegetative control are
discouraged while removal of invasive species are encouraged.
E. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint permit
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP, through
the general permit process.
F. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (any
and all rivers, streams, creeks, rivulets, ditches, watercourses, storm
sewers, lakes, dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs, and all other
bodies or channels of conveyance of surface and underground water, or
parts thereof, whether natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries
of this commonwealth) or wetlands shall be subject to approval by PA
DEP through the joint permit application process, or, where deemed
appropriate by PA DEP, the general permit process. When there is a
question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of
the developer or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
§ 13-3.1 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.1
AO:518
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PA DEP.
G. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would discharge to or be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PA DOT).
H. Low-impact development (LID) is to be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of
runoff through seepage beds, recharge trenches, etc., are encouraged,
where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
I. To promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater,
roof drains should not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers, or roadside ditches unless approved by the Township Engineer
on a case-by-case basis.
J. Where deemed necessary by the Township Engineer, the applicant shall
submit an analysis of the impacts of detained stormwater flows on
downstream areas within the watershed. These impacts shall be
identified with concurrence from the Township Engineer. The analysis
shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to
determine the impact peak discharge modifications from the proposed
development have on critical locations such as dams, tributaries,
existing developments, undersized culverts, flood-prone areas, etc.
K. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the analysis of downstream impacts shall
be submitted to the downstream municipality's engineer or designated
representative for review and comment.
L. The applicant shall notify the owners of all adjacent properties.
Notification shall be via United States certified mail with copies of the
return receipts provided to the Township. Notification shall include the
following language: "A land development plan is being considered by
Harris Township for Tax Parcel (insert parcel number), as shown on the
attached exhibit. Public comment for this land development will be
received at a meeting of the Harris Township Planning Commission on
(insert date). If you cannot attend this meeting, comments may be
directed to Harris Township at (814) 466-6228." A letter and location
map exhibit must be approved by the Township prior to distribution to
the owners of the adjacent properties.
M. Approved stormwater management site plans must be on site at all
times during construction.
N. Use of alternate and/or new stormwater management controls will be
considered by the Township. A description of the proposed alternate
controls must be submitted to the Township, the Centre County

identified which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
§ 13-3.3. Performance standards.
Conservation District, and to DEP. The Township will coordinate any
approvals with the CCCD and/or DEP.
O. The stormwater management site plan must contain a proper long-term
ownership, operation and maintenance plan in accordance with Article
VII of this chapter.
A. "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have the
potential to cause catastrophic loss to a water authority well field.
These areas consist of the delineated one-year zone of contribution and
direct upslope areas tributary to the wells (see Appendix B, Exhibit
1152). Municipalities may update the sensitive area boundaries based on
new research or studies as required.
B. "Water quality sensitive (WQS) developments" are defined as a land
development project that has a high potential to cause catastrophic loss
to local water quality and could potentially threaten groundwater
reservoirs. The following is a provisional list of water quality sensitive
developments. This list may be amended at the discretion of the
Township.
(1) Vehicle fueling stations.
(2) Industrial manufacturing sites*.
(3) Salvage yards.
(4) Recycling centers.
(5) Hazardous material storage areas*.
(6) Interstate highways.
NOTES:
* The Township Engineer will make the determination relative to
what constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case basis.
The Pennsylvania DEP wellhead protection contaminant source
list shall be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must
provide NPDES SIC codes.
152. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 13-3.1 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.3
AO:520
A. General. Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified.
B. Sensitive area district boundaries. The location of sensitive areas or
sensitive area districts (SAD) within the watershed are illustrated on an
Official Map, which is available for inspection at the Township office. A
reduced-scale copy of this map is included as Exhibit 1 in Appendix B of
this chapter.153 The exact location of the boundaries of sensitive areas
are set by drainage areas tributary to each of the points of interest as
illustrated in Appendix B. The exact location of these boundaries as
they apply to a given development site shall be determined using
mapping at a scale which accurately defines the limits of the sensitive
area. If the project site is within the sensitive area (in whole or in part),
two-foot contour interval mapping shall be provided to define the limits
of the sensitive area. If the project site is adjacent to but within 500
linear feet of a defined sensitive area, a five-foot contour interval map
defining the limits of the sensitive area shall be included in the
stormwater management site plan to document the site's location
relative to the sensitive area.
C. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
which is traversed by a SAD boundary, the design criteria for sensitive
areas must be applied if post-development runoff is directed towards
the sensitive area.
D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain from sensitive areas through a
proposed development site that is located entirely in a nonsensitive
area are not required to use or apply the sensitive area criteria.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area shall be subject to the design criteria.
F. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream or off-site
hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with these
standards shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the post-development runoff associated with a two-year return
period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment

the post-development twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.

§ 13-3.4. Calculation methodologies.
Design criteria and calculation methodologies have been classified by
functional group for presentation as follows: 1) peak runoff rate discharge
requirements; 2) stormwater pond capture volumes; 3) recharge volumes;
4) storm drain design, including conveyance, channel protection, and
stability; and 5) water quality standards. These criteria and calculation
methodologies have been developed to simplify stormwater management
designs, unify methods, remove model parameter subjectivity, remove
improperly used methods, and to ensure stormwater management decisions
are based more realistically on hydrologic processes. In addition, common
sense should always be used as a controlling criteria. These standards
provide consistent and process-oriented design procedures for application
by land development professionals. It is recognized that in an attempt to
generalize the computational procedures, assumptions have been made
which on some occasions may be violated. If such a violation is identified,
alternate standards and procedures may be applied. Both the violation and
the alternate procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist
or hydrogeologist. Any request for use of alternate standards or procedures
under this provision must be agreed to by the local Township Engineer prior
to formal submission of plans for consideration by the Township. A flow
chart documenting the stormwater management design process is provided
as Chart A-9, Stormwater Procedural Flow Chart, of this chapter.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105154 regulations (if applicable)
and, at a minimum, pass the post-development twenty-five-year
return period runoff.
(4) It must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel,
other stormwater facilities, roadways, or overland areas must be
capable of safely conveying the one-hundred-year design storm
without causing damage to buildings or other infrastructure.
(5) Where the downstream conveyance channel or other facility is
located within a special flood hazard area (as documented on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map), it must be demonstrated that the limits
of said flood hazard area are not increased by the proposed activity.
(6) Stormwater management ponds that fall under the DEP Chapter
105 criteria of a "dam" must meet the criteria within Chapter
105.155
A. Peak runoff rate control.
(1) Exemption.

155. Editor's Note: See 25 Pa. Code Ch. 105.
§ 13-3.3 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:522
(a) Any site where the increase in post-development peak runoff
rates is determined to be negligible by the Township Engineer
is exempt from the requirement to provide stormwater
detention. In support of this exemption, it must be shown that
the downstream conveyance systems have adequate capacity
to convey the additional discharge without adversely affecting
downstream properties. This does not exempt the requirement
for implementation of designs for water quality, stormwater
conveyance, and/or recharge as required. A stormwater
management site plan and report documenting these design
elements is also required. The Township Engineer shall use a
five-percent increase as a general benchmark for defining
"negligible." The final definition of "negligible" shall be at the
Township Engineer's discretion. Prior to using this exemption
(and prior to any land development plan submission), the
design engineer must provide written documentation and
computations as to why no peak runoff control should be
required. The Township Engineer has the right to reject any
plan which uses this assumption without prior approval of the
Township Engineer. The intent of this exemption is to eliminate
the need for multiple or "piggyback" detention facilities as a
result of minor changes in imperviousness or land use
upstream of existing stormwater control facilities.
(b) Small sites (less than one acre) located directly adjacent to the
main stem of creeks or within the floodplain are not required to
provide stormwater detention unless directed to do so by the
Township Engineer as a result of a documented drainage
problem. All other stormwater management standards must be
implemented, including water quality, adequate stormwater
conveyance, and/or recharge as required. The Township
Engineer has the right to reject any plan that uses this
exemption without prior approval of the Township Engineer.
(2) Stormwater management analysis.
(a) Stormwater management analysis must be performed using
the following models. The size criteria are based on drainage
area size, including site area and all off-site area draining
across the development.
[1] Up to 100 acres in size: NRCS's TR-55 or TR-20.
[2] Over 100 acres in size: NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-1 (HECHMS).
(b) The Modified Rational Method using the Gert Aron Curves may
be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in size
without prior authorization from the Township Engineer. The
Modified Rational Method may also be used for sites between
two and five acres in size where the Township Engineer has
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:523
approved the method's use. In this case, the design engineer
must make a written request to the Township Engineer
explaining why the use of the Modified Rational Method is
more appropriate than the NRCS's methods for the site in
question. Use of the Modified Rational methodology should be
limited to the special cases identified above. In addition, since
the minimum discharge criteria are based on a calibration
of the NRCS runoff mode, their use is not appropriate if the
Modified Rational Method is used for runoff computations.
(c) The Township Engineer has the right to reject any SWM design
that uses hydrograph combinations with the Modified Rational
Method where the designer has not validated that the effects of
the timing differences are negligible. In addition, the Township
Engineer has the right to reject any SWM design that
improperly uses the method for determining runoff volumes or
does not properly apply the method.
(d) More intensive physically based models may be used at the
discretion of the Township Engineer, but only for sites greater
than 100 acres in size.
(e) Commercial software packages that use the basic
computational methods of TR-55 or TR-20 are permitted.
(f) The NRCS models and methods recommended above are based
on data collected from actual watersheds. In contrast to this,
stormwater management analysis for land development
activities is often conducted using property lines to define
drainage boundaries. Drainage areas based on property
boundaries are not true watersheds and are referred to here as
"hypothetical" drainage areas. It is known that these
hypothetical drainage areas do not respond like natural
watersheds. Peak runoff rates from hypothetical drainage
areas are much smaller than comparable runoff rates from
natural watersheds of the same size. Therefore, wherever
possible, pre- and post-development stormwater analysis
should be conducted for watersheds that are as nearly natural
as possible. Also, conducting stormwater analysis for a lot-bylot
comparison, such as within residential developments, is not
permitted. Partitioning drainage areas into different
subwatersheds for the post-development scenarios is
acceptable.
(g) It is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not be
used where the relative size of the watershed compared to the
site size would inappropriately distort the pre- to postdevelopment
runoff comparison. In these cases, a hypothetical
drainage area defined by the property boundary should be
used because it will allow for a better estimate of runoff
changes directly downstream of the site. In addition, the
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:524
designer should recognize that, within the Spring Creek
Watershed, typical hypothetical drainage areas, in their
predevelopment or natural condition, do not produce surface
runoff during minor to moderate rainfall events. Available
hydrologic models do not accurately reflect this condition. This
often results in post-development nuisance flooding since the
models overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude.
(3) Major natural drainage divides may not be altered without the prior
consent of the Township Engineer.
(4) Pre- and post-development stormwater management analysis shall
be conducted using the following design storms:
(a) One-year.
(b) Two-year.
(c) Ten-year.
(d) One-hundred-year.
(5) The twenty-four-hour precipitation depths as obtained from NOAA
Atlas 14 shall be used for stormwater management analysis.
(6) The NRCS's Type II precipitation distribution is required for all
stormwater management analyses.
(7) The NRCS's dimensionless unit hydrograph "k" factor shall be 484
for both pre- and post-development stormwater analyses.
(8) All undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods in
good hydrologic condition. Existing impervious areas may be
modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions. The
Township may require a percentage of the existing impervious area
up to a maximum of 20% to be modeled as meadow in areas where
there are known existing stormwater concerns downstream of the
project area or where the site being developed has either deficient
or nonexisting stormwater management facilities. Developers of
sites with existing impervious areas are highly encouraged to set
up a meeting with the Township prior to design so that any
additional requirements are identified prior to plan submission.
(9) The NRCS's curve number (CN) shall be used as the rainfall to
runoff transformation parameter for all stormwater management
analyses.
(10) Curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in prepackaged
hydrologic models. It should be recognized that the CN is only a
design tool with a large degree of statistical variability. For large
sites, CN's should realistically be rounded to the nearest whole
number.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:525
(11) The NRCS's method to determine unconnected impervious area
adjustments for CN can be used for distinctly defined impervious
land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a dispersed manner. The
method may only be used to calculate runoff from site impervious
areas that actually flow across pervious areas. The method cannot
be applied to the entire site using average weighted CN values.
(12) Soils underlain by carbonate geology (limestone or dolomite) shall
have a hydrologic soil group (HSG) B used for both pre- and postdevelopment
conditions, regardless of the NRCS or Soil Survey's
description, except for the following two conditions:
(a) Compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of HSG C
for post-development conditions, regardless of the NRCS or
Centre County Soil Survey's description. For most
developments, compacted structural fill areas are under
impervious surfaces, but may include islands within parking
areas, fringe land, etc. A HSG C shall also be applied to large
projects that clear and compact building pad areas for later
phases of development under an initial phase. The Township
Engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of
a land development site constitute compacted structural fill.
The intent is to account for large compacted areas and not
minor grading within lawn areas.
(b) Soils identified as "on floodplains" or "on terraces above
floodplains" in the Centre County Soil Survey will use the HSG
as designated in the Soil Survey. Refer to Appendix A for a list
of the soils.156
(13) Soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the HSG as
specified by the NRCS or Soil Survey's description, except for the
following two conditions:
(a) Wooded areas on HSG C and D soils shall be treated as HSG B
for predevelopment conditions. Disturbed post-development
wooded areas shall carry the NRCS or Soil Survey's defined
HSG with a minimum HSG of B.
(b) Highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of
HSG C for post-development conditions, regardless of the
NRCS or Soil Survey's description. For most developments,
these areas are normally covered with impervious surfaces,
but may include islands within parking areas, fringe land, etc.
A HSG of C shall also be used for large projects that clear and
grade land for later phases of development. The Township
Engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of
a land development site constitute compacted structural fill.
The intent is to account for large compacted areas and not
156. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:526
minor grading within lawn areas or small areas around
buildings, etc.
(14) Areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by removing
the storage volume from the predevelopment condition. The
designer may assume that infiltration in the closed depression does
not occur during a design runoff event. Areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to adjust peak runoff rates to
stormwater management ponds for the post-development analysis.
This allowance has been developed to entice designers to
intentionally design or leave in place small closed depressions that
can reduce the total volume required from a stormwater
management pond. The site designer is responsible to document
downstream impacts if the closed depression were removed.
(15) Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from the
modeled point-of-interest drainage areas defining predevelopment
peak flows. Assumptions that sinkholes spill over during some
storm events must be supported by acceptable documentation (as
determined by the Township Engineer). In addition, the design
professional must be aware that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will
frequently result in downstream flooding and should not be done if
existing downstream flooding already occurs. The site designer is
responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole were
to stop taking stormwater runoff.
(16) Ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by the
methods established in the NRCS's TR-55 Manual (1986). However,
more rigorous documented methods are acceptable (as determined
by the Township Engineer).
(17) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II ("ARC II," previously
"AMC II") must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes. In addition, prior to any
continuous simulation model being used in the Spring Creek Basin
for any other purposes, the model unit hydrograph must be
modified for common events in additional to extreme events based
on an in-depth analysis of historical data from the basin.
(18) Time of concentration computational methodologies.
(a) The following time of concentration (Tc) computational
methodologies shall be used, unless another method is
preapproved by the Township Engineer:
[1] Predevelopment: NRCS's Lag Equation.
[2] Post-development; commercial, industrial, or other areas
with large impervious areas (greater than 20% impervious
area): NRCS's Segmental Method.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:527
[3] Post-development; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS's
Lag Equation.
(b) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition
that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. For
example, large impervious areas bordered by small pervious
areas may not consider the effect of the pervious areas in the
Tc computation. If the designer wants to consider the affect of
the pervious area, runoff from the pervious and impervious
areas must be computed separately with the hydrographs
being combined to determine the total runoff from the area.
(c) Under no circumstance will the post-development Tc be
greater than the predevelopment Tc for any watershed or
subwatershed modeling purposes. This includes when the
designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities.
In the event that the designer believes that the postdevelopment
Tc is greater, it will still be set by default equal to
the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(d) Refer to Subsection A(28) regarding impervious area flashing
(IAF).
(19) Post-development minimum discharges.
(a) The following post-development minimum discharges are
permitted for use with the NRCS (CN) runoff model:
1-year return period Qpmin = 0.018 (DA) + 0.2
2-year return period Qpmin = 0.03 (DA) + 0.4
10-year return period Qpmin = 0.09 (DA) + 1.0
Where:
DA = The drainage area in acres
Qpmin = Minimum allowable peak runoff rate in cfs
(b) For return periods greater than 10 years, the minimum
discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment peak
runoff rate.
(c) The minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate for
use with the Rational Method. This is because these values
were developed based on NRCS model corrections and do not
actually represent a true physical process or discharge.
However, common sense should be used by both the designer
and reviewer in the evaluation of acceptable minimum
discharges for use with the Rational Method.
(d) The intent of the minimum discharge is to allow reasonable
runoff release from a site when a hydrologic model has
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:528
produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to zero. The
method is not permitted for areas that previously drained
completely to sinkholes in order to bypass the sinkhole after
development.
(e) These minimum discharge values include the total of all
stormwater management facilities discharges and undetained
area discharges. Peak runoff rates for undetained fringe areas
(where the designer has made a realistic effort to control all
new impervious areas) will be computed using the
predevelopment time of concentration for the drainage areas
tributary to them. Undetained areas are those portions of the
site that cannot be routed to a stormwater management facility
due to topography and typically include lower pond berms or
small areas around entrance drives. The site drainage areas
used shall represent the predevelopment condition, even if
drainage areas are altered following development.
(20) All lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and
noncarbonate areas must be considered impervious and may not be
used as pervious areas for stormwater management computations.
"Lined" here means lined with synthetic liners or bentonite. All
other compacted soil liners will be considered to be HSG D for
hydrologic computations.
(21) Stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the
purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a
negligible discharge from these structures during design event
routing. Only discharges from the primary principal spillway or
emergency spillway need to be considered. Discharges from
subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not be
considered during design event routing. All subsurface drains are
to be equipped with a restrictor plate with a one-inch opening in
order to prevent the subsurface drain from functioning as a
primary orifice.
(22) Stormwater management ponds that have a pond capture,
recharge, or water quality component shall assume that the basin
is full to the controlling component volume at the beginning of
design event routing.
(23) Stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of the
one-hundred-year return period peak runoff rate assuming that all
of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged, and the principal
spillway overflow is 50% clogged. A minimum of a six-inch
freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting maximum
water surface elevations (WSE). Any embankment emergency
spillway can be assumed to be unclogged. SWM ponds with
embankments completely made up of natural undisturbed soils
(fully in cut) or where roadways act as the emergency spillway are
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:529
permitted. However, the design engineer must verify downstream
stability and control.
(24) All pre- and post-development comparisons of peak flows shall be
rounded to tenths of a cfs. The intent here is to recognize the
accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic modeling
procedures. Again, small differences between pre- and postdevelopment
discharge rates should be permitted when no
negative downstream impacts will result.
(25) The full Modified Puls routing method must be used for stormwater
management pond analyses. Simplified methods of determining
pond size requirements such as those in TR-55 (1986) can only be
used for preliminary pond size estimates. The full Modified Puls
routing method must be used for stormwater management pond
analyses. Simplified methods of determining pond size
requirements such as those in TR-55 (1986) can only be used for
preliminary pond size estimates.
(26) Prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the analysis
of underground stormwater management facilities unless it can be
verified that the program rounding subroutines used for the stage/
storage data do not affect the results. This is because, for very
small storage volumes, the program may round off the volume to a
significant percentage.
(27) Full supporting documentation must be provided for all stormwater
management designs.
(28) Designs must be checked for impervious area flash (IAF). This
check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor
modeling choices specifically related to the time of concentration.
This analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be
modeled without the pervious areas. The time of concentration
should also be determined from the impervious areas only. If the
IAF analysis results in a higher peak runoff rate at a culvert or
discharge from a pond, this higher rate must be used for the final
design/comparison. The check will frequently yield higher values if
a watershed's impervious area is located primarily near the
watershed outlet or point of interest.
B. Pond capture volumes (Cv).
(1) To minimize nuisance flooding from small precipitation events, a
runoff capture volume is required for all stormwater management
ponds that do not discharge directly to natural, well-defined (with
bed and banks) perennial streams. In general, natural well-defined
streams in the Spring Creek Basin are limited to those delineated
as USGS perennial streams. This should be treated as a guideline
and not a steadfast rule. The final determination is at the discretion
of the Township Engineer. The pond capture volume is a volume of
runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation of any free
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:530
surface principal spillway orifice. No principal spillway orifice
(except those connected to subsurface drains), regardless of how
small, shall be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume.
(2) The Centre County Conservation District (CCCD) receives
numerous complaints regarding ponds that are located at the
downslope edge of a property that result in discharging runoff onto
downstream properties in an uncontrolled manner or where no
existing defined outlet channel exists. This is a very common
problem in areas underlain by carbonate rock. These discharges
can cause erosion and flooding downstream. While the pond
capture volume is intended to minimize some of these negative
effects, it cannot deter or reduce the impacts from poor design
practices. Therefore, whenever possible, the CCCD recommends
that the designer consider the downstream morphological changes
that may occur and, when possible, consider constructing
conveyance systems to a stable natural channel. In some cases, this
may require cooperation between landowners.
(3) The capture volume is defined as a runoff depth of 0.25 inch from
all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater management
facility. This volume will be allowed to infiltrate, evaporate, or
dewater from a subsurface drain system connected directly to the
facility's principal spillway. Supporting computations that show
that 90% of the capture volume can dewater in a maximum of 72
hours must be provided. For surface ponds, the maximum depth of
ponding for the capture volume shall be three feet (a health and
safety precaution). However, in areas under karst influence, a
limiting maximum ponding depth of 18 inches is recommended.
Designers may always increase the capture volume to a value
greater than the identified standard as long as the ponding depth
criteria are met.
(4) To simplify computational requirements for design event analysis,
designers do not need to calculate discharges from subsurface
drains related to the capture volumes if the filter media is sand, or
smaller than AASHTO 57 stone. The capture volume is to control
runoff rates from impervious areas and is not related to water
quality. However, pond designs that include a water quality volume
that is greater than the required capture volume are assumed to
have also met the required capture volume as long as it dewaters as
required.
(5) Designs that rely on the natural infiltration of in situ soils must
provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used for
analysis. Infiltration rates reported in the Soil Survey of Centre
County or other published rates may be used at the discretion of
the Township Engineer.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:531
(6) The pond capture volume should always be used when upslope
areas are developed where the pond's design creates a point
discharge that did not previously exist.
(7) Stormwater management detention facilities that connect directly
to storm drain pipe networks that discharge to natural well-defined
channels do not require a capture volume.
C. Recharge volumes (Rv).
(1) The purpose of the recharge portion of this chapter is twofold.
First, the recharge requirement is to mitigate the loss of
groundwater recharge associated with the creation of impervious
surfaces. In addition, the recharge criteria is to mitigate the
increase in runoff volume associated with the creation of
impervious surfaces. This increase in runoff volume has significant
impacts on downstream landowners. These impacts are most often
exhibited in the form of increased nuisance flooding and channel or
drainageway erosion and instability. According to local Township
Engineers and representatives of the Centre County Conservation
District, these problems are of significant local concern. The
magnitude of these problems increases with the percentage of
impervious coverage created on a site.
(2) Recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all proposed
impervious areas. The required recharge volume shall be computed
as 0.5 inch of runoff from all proposed impervious areas. It is noted
that lined detention ponds and compacted fill areas are considered
to be impervious when calculating site impervious area for
recharge considerations. In addition, land areas covered by paver
blocks, pervious pavement, and other structural surface treatments
which permit surface infiltration can be treated as pervious areas
when calculating the site impervious area for recharge
considerations as long as the structural infiltration practice is
supported by sound design and appropriate construction
specifications. The Township Engineer may require submission of
supporting documentation prior to approving structural infiltration
areas as pervious areas.
(3) The following design practices can be used as credits to reduce the
recharge volume requirement:
(a) Residential roof areas (detached, duplex, and townhome
dwellings) and commercial/industrial buildings with roof areas
less than 5,000 square feet can be removed from the computed
impervious area when these roof areas are sumped to dry wells
designed in accordance with the following minimum standard:
[1] Sump design criteria. To meet the recharge criteria, sump
storage or voids volume shall be equal to 0.04 cubic feet
per square foot of roof area (0.5 inch rainfall depth). If
sump stone has a voids ratio of 40%, the total sump volume
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:532
will be 0.10 cubic feet per square foot of roof area. When
designed only to meet this recharge criteria, the maximum
size for a single sump is 100 cubic feet, and the minimum
sump surface area (A) to depth (D) ratio (A/D) must be a
minimum of 4/1. The sump depth less any freeboard should
not exceed 24 inches.
[2] This roof sump standard shall apply unless the Township
has a separate roof sump standard for water quantity or
peak control.
(b) All or portions of driveways, roadways, and parking areas can
be removed from the impervious area calculation when sheet
flow from these areas is directed to undisturbed natural buffer/
filter areas or constructed filter strips. This flow must be
dispersed as sheet flow as it crosses the buffer/filter area.
Sheet flow velocities should be nonerosive as they cross the
impervious area/filter interface.
[1] To ensure proper infiltration characteristics, the natural
soil profile within natural buffer/filter areas cannot be
disturbed during construction. Completely undisturbed
natural recharge areas serve this function best. However,
minor surface scaring, seeding, and landscaping is
permitted in these areas as long as natural grades are not
altered. In special cases, when approved by the Township
Engineer, minor grading, combined with soil profile
reconstruction, may be permitted in natural buffer/filter
areas. In addition, the following standards apply to natural
filter/buffer areas:
[a] Natural filter/buffer areas must have a minimum width
of five feet or 1/2 of the impervious area drainage
length immediately tributary to the buffer area,
whichever is greater. This width is measured parallel
to the direction of sheet flow.
[b] To qualify for a recharge volume credit, the surface
slope of natural filter/buffer areas must be conducive
to recharge and not result in flow concentration or
erosion. To meet this intent, the surface slope of the
area tributary to the natural buffer/filter area and the
surface slope of the natural buffer/filter area itself
may not exceed 5%. In special cases, steeper slopes
may be used if specifically authorized by the Township
Engineer.
[c] The total impervious area tributary to a natural buffer/
filter area cannot exceed twice the buffer/filter area.
[2] To qualify for a recharge volume credit, constructed filter
strips shall be designed to the following standards:
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:533
[a] The minimum filter strip width shall be five feet or 1/2
of the impervious area drainage length immediately
tributary to the constructed filter strip, whichever is
greater. This width is measured parallel to the
direction of sheet flow.
[b] The total impervious area tributary to a constructed
filter strip area cannot exceed twice the constructed
filter strip area.
[c] The surface slope of the area tributary to the
constructed filter strip area and the surface slope of
the constructed filter strip area itself may not exceed
5% and 3%, respectively. In special cases, steeper
slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the
Township Engineer.
[d] The filter strip surface shall consist of a minimum of
six inches of natural or reconstructed topsoil with a
stable grass surface treatment. Reconstructed topsoil
designs must be approved by the Township Engineer
prior to application. Reconstructed topsoil consists of
soils augmented by tillage and the addition of soil
amendments such as compost, lime, animal manures,
crop residues, etc.
[e] To minimize erosion of the topsoil layer during
construction, it is recommended that these areas be
sodded. However, the Township Engineer may permit
the use of an acceptable erosion control seeding
application. In this later case, any loss of topsoil and
seed must be replaced until a permanent vegetative
stand is achieved.
(c) Sidewalks separated from roadways and/or other impervious
surfaces by a grass strip of equal or greater width than the
sidewalk itself can be removed from the impervious area
calculation when the sidewalks are graded so that sheet flow
from the walk is directed to the grass strip. Sidewalks with
steep longitudinal slopes that themselves would act as
channels during runoff events cannot take advantage of this
credit. A five-percent longitudinal sidewalk slope shall be used
as the benchmark defining steep slopes.
(d) Impervious areas tributary to natural closed depressions can
be subtracted from the total site impervious area used in the
recharge volume calculation as long as a qualified geotechnical
engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these
site-specific applications. Water quality pretreatment may be
necessary prior to the direct discharge of runoff to existing
closed depressions or sinkholes.
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:534
(e) Impervious areas tributary to man-made closed depressions
can be subtracted from the total site impervious area as long as
a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to
the soundness of these site-specific applications. Man-made
closed depressions can be created through the use of low-head
berms one foot or less in height.
(f) Additional credits may apply for undisturbed land areas that
are known to have high infiltration capacity and that are
maintained or enhanced. These areas must be defined and
quantified from actual site data collection.
(4) After credits, the remaining recharge volume shall be directed to a
recharge BMP such as infiltration trenches, beds, etc. These
facilities can be located in open areas or under pavement
structures. The appropriateness of the particular infiltration
practice proposed, as well as the design parameters used, shall be
supported by a geotechnical report certified by a qualified
professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, geotechnical
engineer, etc.).
(5) Stormwater recharge requirements or credits affect stormwater
management design requirements. For stormwater management
computations, the reduction of site CNs based only on a weighting
type analysis, as is sometimes done for cluster-type developments,
is not permitted. However, for stormwater management purposes,
the CN for recharged areas can be computed using the NRCS
method for disconnected impervious areas. The actual hydrologic
process that occurs within the basin must be stressed in all
recharge situations.
(6) These recharge requirements must be met on all sites unless it can
be demonstrated that recharge would be inappropriate. Any
request for such a waiver from these recharge requirements must
be accompanied by a supporting report certified by a qualified
professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, geotechnical
engineer, etc.).
(7) Developers and site design professionals are encouraged to use a
higher standard for recharge volume on sites where local site
conditions do not restrict a higher standard.
(8) Water quality sensitive (WQS) developments must use an
acceptable pretreatment BMP prior to recharge. Acceptable
pretreated BMPs for these developments include BMPs that are
based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such as
chemical coagulation.
(9) Accounting for recharge within lined stormwater management
ponds is not permitted. However, if unlined, uncompacted ponds
and/or depressed lawn areas are used to satisfy water quality or
capture volume criteria, these areas and volumes can also be used
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:535
to meet recharge requirements as previously defined. Additional
recharge volume may be credited to these areas as long as it is
demonstrated by a qualified professional that recharge processes
can naturally occur in these areas.
(10) Finally, because this analysis is concerned with trying to
adequately represent real processes that occur within the
watershed, there will be areas that cannot physically recharge
stormwater. These areas include exfiltration areas that are
commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where clay pans
exist, and saturation areas near major streams or floodplains.
These areas may not accept recharge during most runoff events.
These areas are exempt from recharge requirements when these
conditions are documented and certified by a qualified professional
(soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, or geotechnical engineer).
In addition, stormwater management techniques relying on
infiltration techniques are not permitted in these areas.
(11) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge requirement in the
following situations:
(a) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge requirement
in highly developed areas or areas undergoing redevelopment
where the Township Engineer has determined that forced
recharge could have adverse impacts on adjacent landowner
structures, property, or Township infrastructure. These
waivers should be limited to small land areas (generally less
than five acres in size), where the ability to place recharge
beds may be limited or may hinder redevelopment.
(b) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge requirement
in areas where a qualified soils scientist or geologist has
determined that none of the site soils are suitable for recharge,
or that the location of the suitable soils is such that harm to
adjoining properties could occur as stated under Subsection
C(11)(a) above.
(c) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge requirement
in areas where recharge cannot physically occur as
documented by a qualified soil scientist, geologist, or
hydrologist. These areas include:
[1] Exfiltration areas commonly found at the base of wooded
hillsides where clay pans or fragipans exist; and
[2] Saturation areas near major streams or floodplains.
(12) As identified above, recharge analysis and/or waiver requests must
be supported by a geotechnical report sealed by a qualified
professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, or
geotechnical engineer). The intent of this report will be to establish
the suitability of a particular parcel of land or area for recharge and
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:536
to identify areas on a development site appropriate for recharge. It
is recommended that the geotechnical/soils consultant discuss the
extent and approach to the analysis with the Township Engineer
prior to initiating the field investigation. At a minimum, this report
should include the following information:
(a) A description of the geotechnical site investigation performed,
including the methods and procedures used.
(b) Data presentation.
(c) Analysis results, including the following minimum information:
[1] A map identifying site areas inappropriate for recharge
along with supporting justification. In addition to
illustrating topographic features, significant geologic and
hydrologic features should be identified (rock outcrops,
sinkholes, closed depressions, etc.).
[2] Determination of the permeability coefficient for potential
recharge areas.
[3] Determination of the infiltration capacity of natural site
soils.
[4] Location, depth, and permeability coefficient for any
restrictive layers identified.
[5] Soil uniformity.
[6] Depth to bedrock in potential recharge areas, and a
statement reflecting the uniformity of the depth to bedrock
across the site.
[7] A statement relating to the site's proximity to fracture
zones within the bedrock.
[8] Additional information deemed pertinent by the
geotechnical engineer.
(d) Recommendations for any special design considerations
necessary for the design of recharge systems on the site. For
example, required soil depth over bedrock, appropriate surface
grades over recharge areas, appropriate hydraulic head over
recharge areas, etc.
(e) Justification as to why the site should be developed to a high
impervious density if the site has adverse soil and geotechnical
limitations, which prohibit the ability to induce natural
recharge. Explain how these limitations will not create the
potential for undue harm to the environment and the Spring
Creek Watershed when the site is developed.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:537
(f) Where it has been shown that recharge cannot be performed
and a waiver of the recharge requirements is being requested,
the Township shall require that the first one inch of runoff from
all new impervious areas be treated through underdrained
facilities. These facilities may include underdrained basins,
rain gardens, and infiltration trenches. Treatment is to include
use of an amended topsoil to provide filtration of the
stormwater. All underdrain outlets are to include a restrictor
plate to prevent the underdrain system from functioning as a
primary outlet.
(13) The following guidelines are provided relative to the use of
subsurface exfiltration BMPs (often incorrectly referred to as
"engineered infiltration BMPs"):
(a) Soils should have a minimum percolation rate of 50 min/cm for
effective operation of subsurface exfiltration BMPs. If no site
soils have percolation rates of 50 min/cm, subsurface
exfiltration BMPs should not be used.
(b) A minimum of 30 inches of soil must be maintained between
the bottom of a subsurface exfiltration BMP and the top of
bedrock or seasonally high groundwater table. This statement
is subject to the recommendation of a qualified geotechnical
engineer.
(c) If the minimum percolation rate is not met and/or the minimum
soil depth cannot be maintained on a site, recharge should be
accommodated by directing shallow sheet flow from
impervious areas across surface filter strips and/or
undisturbed natural areas, or some other innovative surface
infiltration feature should be used. Limiting subsurface
percolation rates and/or depth to bedrock shall not by
themselves warrant a recharge waiver.
(14) In addition, since recharge is intended as a volume control,
innovative or new methods that address the significant increase in
the volume of runoff from sites having large impervious areas are
encouraged. These volume control alternatives can be used only if
they can be shown to function with the original intent through
sound engineering and science. The final determination of original
intent shall always be the right of the Township Engineer.
D. Storm drain conveyance system design. Storm drainage conveyance
systems consist of storm sewer pipes, swales, and open channels.
Computational methods for design of storm drain conveyance systems
shall be as follows:
(1) Recommended computational methods (models) for storm drain
design are based on site or watershed drainage area as follows:
(a) Up to 200 acres in size: Rational Method.
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:538
(b) Between 200 acres and 1.5 square miles in size: HEC-1; PSRM;
TR-20.
(c) Over 1.5 square miles in size: PSU-IV with the carbonate
adjustment factor at the discretion of the Township Engineer.
(d) Other methods as approved by the Township Engineer, such as
SWMM, SWIRM-ROUTE, etc.
(2) Rational coefficients.
(a) Rational coefficients used are to be from Rawls et al. (1981),
PADOT Design Manual 2-10, or using the Aron curves to
convert CNs to C. If the Aron curves are used, all CNs must be
applicable to the HSG, as identified by the NRCS.
(b) The design engineer may choose to use the following Rational
C coefficients without regard to soil HSG for small sites.
However, it is recommended that they be used only for storm
drains up to 24 inches in diameter. The use of these
conservative values shall fully be the choice of the design
engineer.
[1] All impervious areas: C = 0.95.
[2] All pervious areas: C = 0.30.
(3) Storm drains shall be designed at a minimum using a ten-year
runoff event without surcharging inlets. Storm drains tributary to a
multiple-site SWM facility across Township roads or crossing other
properties must convey, at a minimum, a twenty-five-year runoff
event without surcharging inlets. Runoff events in excess of the
indicated design event must be conveyed safely downstream.
(4) Inlets on grade cannot assume a sumped condition for hydraulic
modeling (i.e., top of inlet casting set below pavement surface in
parking areas).
(5) The Township Engineer may require the analysis of the onehundred-
year peak runoff rates for conveyance purposes in some
instances where regional SWM facilities are employed.
(6) Any storm drain within state or federal rights-of-way or that falls
under the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to the minimum
requirements of this chapter.
(7) The time of concentration (Tc) can be computed by any method
which best represents the subject watershed. However, the NRCS's
segmental method is not recommended for use with drainage areas
that are predominately undeveloped and are greater than 100
acres in size. The NRCS Lag Equation or another more appropriate
method should be used under these conditions.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:539
(8) For any drainage area smaller than five acres in size, a Tc of five
minutes may always be assumed at the discretion of the design
engineer (for the post-development condition), without needing to
provide supporting documentation.
(9) Precipitation values applicable to the entire Spring Creek Drainage
Basin are those reflected in the PA DOT's IDF curves for Region 2,
regardless if the area was formerly considered in Region 3.
(10) Storm drain conveyance system stability (swales, open channels,
and pipe discharge aprons) shall be computed using a ten-year
return period peak runoff rate.
(11) Storm sewers, where required by zoning and land use densities,
shall be placed under or immediately adjacent to the roadway side
of the curb, or as directed by the Township, when parallel to the
street within the right-of-way.
(12) When located in undedicated land, they shall be placed within a
drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the
Township Engineer.
(13) The use of properly designed, graded and turfed drainage swales is
encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial and industrial
areas and, where approved by the Township Engineer, in
residential areas. Such swales shall be designed not only to carry
the required discharge without excessive erosion, but also to
increase the time of concentration, reduce the peak discharge and
velocity, and permit the water to percolate into the soil, where
appropriate.
(14) Inlet types and inlet assemblies.
(a) Inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards for
Roadway Construction as approved by the Township Engineer.
[1] Inlets shall, at a minimum, be located at the lowest point of
street intersections to intercept the stormwater before it
reaches pedestrian crossing; or at sag points of vertical
curves in the street alignment which provide a natural
point of ponding of surface stormwater.
[2] Where the Township deems it necessary because of special
land requirements, special inlets may be approved.
[3] The interval between inlets collecting stormwater runoff
shall be determined in accordance with DM-2, Chapter 10,
Section 3, "Capacity of Roadway Hydraulic Facilities."
(b) In curbed sections, the maximum encroachment of water on
the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a through traffic
lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during the ten-year
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:540
design storm of five-minute duration. Inlets shall be provided
to control the encroachment of water on the pavement. When
inlets are used in a storm system within the right-of-way limits
of a street in lieu of manholes, the spacing of such inlets shall
not exceed the maximum distance of 450 feet.
(15) Accessible drainage structures shall be located on a continuous
storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations
where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all
vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding 5°, and at all points
of convergence of two or more influent storm sewer mains. The
construction locations of accessible drainage structures shall be as
indicated on the land development SWM site plan or area SWM site
plan approved by the Township.
(16) When evidence available to the Township indicates that existing
storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined by hydrograph
summation and are accessible, the subdivider may connect their
stormwater facilities to the existing storm sewers so long as the
peak rate of discharge does not exceed the amount permitted by
this chapter.
(17) All other storm drain design methods are to be the same as
specified in existing local ordinances.
(18) Computational procedures other than those indicated here should
follow the methods of the Federal Highway Administration's Urban
Drainage Design Manual [Hydraulic Engineering Circular No 22.
(HEC-22)].
E. Water quality standards.
(1) Water quality performance standards. To minimize adverse impacts
to stream health resulting from stormwater nonpoint source (NPS)
pollution, standards are provided for the implementation of water
quality best management practices (BMPs) to reduce NPS pollutant
loadings resulting from land development activities. The following
performance standards and guidelines shall be addressed at all
sites where stormwater management is required.
(a) Site designs shall minimize the generation of stormwater
runoff through the use of low-impact design techniques.
(b) Stormwater runoff from all land development activities should
be treated through the use of nonstructural and structural
BMPs to effectively treat the adverse impacts of stormwater
runoff, including NPS pollutants.
(c) Water quality BMPs shall be incorporated into site designs to
treat the required water quality volume as defined below.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:541
(d) The use of nonstructural BMPs shall always take priority over
the use of structural BMPs. The use of innovative BMPs and
low-impact site planning is encouraged to reduce the
generation of stormwater runoff and effectively treat
pollutants transported in stormwater from the site.
(e) The use of multiple nonstructural water quality techniques
along with new, emerging, and innovative techniques is
encouraged to improve the quality of stormwater runoff to
receiving areas and reduce and/or eliminate the need for
structural BMPs. The Township Engineer should be consulted
to clarify the design concept for meeting or exceeding the
intent of this section.
(f) Where nonstructural BMPs are unable to effectively treat all of
the stormwater runoff generated from land development
activities, structural BMPs shall be designed to capture and
treat the computed water quality volume (WQv).
(g) The priority pollutant source areas to be treated with BMPs are
streets, parking lots, driveways, and roof areas.
(h) Due to the karst nature of the watershed, stormwater
discharges from water quality sensitive developments and
discharges to sensitive wellhead protection areas (defined in
Appendix B, Exhibit 1157) will require special consideration. In
these instances, the applicant shall provide water quality
pretreatment (use of a filtering BMP and/or special structural
design features) to prevent the discharge of stormwater
contaminants to groundwater resources. In addition,
hydrogeologic studies may be required to document potential
karst-related impacts.
(i) Prior to stormwater management and water quality design,
applicants should consult with the Township Engineer to verify
stormwater quality criteria and present proposed features and
concepts for the treatment of stormwater runoff. Following this
meeting, the Township Engineer shall define any needed
support studies or documentation.
(2) Water quality volume (WQv).
(a) The required water quality volume that must be treated for
nonsensitive areas underlain by carbonate rock (see exhibits in
Appendix B158) within the Spring Creek Basin shall be
computed as:
157. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
158. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:542
WQdepth = 0.25+(0.012)2.9(0.044(SIA))
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
WQdepth = Depth in inches that must be captured for
impervious areas
SIA = Percent of site impervious area (all paved
areas and roof with asphalt-based roofs)
A = Total of all paved areas and asphalt-based
roofs on site in acres
(b) The required water quality volume that must be treated for any
WQS development, on sites in sensitive areas underlain by
carbonate rock, and all areas not underlain by carbonate rock
is to be computed within the entire Spring Creek Basin as:
WQdepth = the larger of 0.5 inch or 0.25+(0.012)2.9(0.044(SIA))
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
WQdepth = Depth in inches that must be captured for
impervious areas
SIA = Percent of site impervious area (all paved
areas and roof with asphalt-based roofs)
A = Total of all paved areas and asphalt-based
roofs on site in acres
(c) For designs in which the final roof material is unknown, the
design engineer must assume an asphalt-based roof.
(d) The water quality volume must be captured and treated
through a water quality BMP over an extended period of time
as per the specific requirements of each structure. Credits to
reduce the effective impervious area are applicable as
presented in Chapter 4 of the stormwater management plan.
(3) Water quality credits. Due to the karst nature of the Spring Creek
Basin, the nonstructural water quality credits and techniques
identified below may be limited for suitability and use based on
development type and location. These limitations for use are
specified in the restrictions section for each credit. The Township
Engineer may require additional documentation or investigation
prior to use of each specific credit to reduce the risks of sinkhole
development or groundwater contamination for sensitive areas and
development types. No area may be double counted for use with
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:543
credits. The combined credits of natural area conservation and
vegetated filter strips is limited to 50% of the site's impervious
area. The drainageway credit is limited to 50% of the site's
impervious area. The drainageway protection credit is limited to
50% of the site's impervious area. The maximum total water quality
credit for any site may therefore be 100% of the site's impervious
area.

(4) Drainageway protection.
(a) A water quality credit is given for the protection of natural
drainageways on a development site. Natural karst
drainageways within the Spring Creek Watershed often do not
exhibit a defined channel bed and banks. More often, these
drainageways appear as wide, shallow parabolic swales. These
drainageways are an integral part of the natural drainage
system and often exhibit significant infiltration capacity.
Protection of these drainageways is critically important to the
health of the watershed.
(b) The drainageway protection (DWP) area is defined as an area
centered on the drainageway and having a minimum width of
300 feet. The Township Engineer may modify the defined
minimum width in cases where natural landforms define an
appropriate alternate width.
(c) The impervious area used in the WQv equation for the
development site may be reduced by twice the area of the
preserved drainageway (two-to-one ratio).
[1] Restrictions on the credit.
[a] Drainageway protection areas must remain in an
undisturbed condition during and after construction
activities. There can be no construction activity within
these areas, including temporary access roads or
storage of equipment or materials. Temporary access
for the construction of utilities crossing this protection
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:544
area may be permitted at the Township Engineer's
discretion. However, the alignment of any such
crossing must be perpendicular to the drainageway.
[b] These areas should be placed in a conservation
easement or be permanently preserved through a
similarly enforceable agreement with the Township.
[c] The limits of the undisturbed DWP area and
conservation easement must be shown on all
construction plans.
[d] The DWP area must be located on the development
site.
[e] The maximum total DWPA credit is 100% of the site
impervious area.
[f] Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
[2] Sensitive area and development restrictions.
[a] DWP areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive
areas unless the impervious area actually flows across
the area as sheet flow.
[b] Untreated urban runoff from sensitive development
types may not be directed to DWP areas without
pretreatment.
(5) Natural area conservation. A water quality credit is given for
natural areas that are conserved at the development site, thereby
maintaining predevelopment water quality characteristics. The
impervious area used in the WQv equation for the development site
may be reduced by the natural area conserved in the water quality
volume computations. Natural area conservation is different than
vegetated filter strip/recharge area and drainageway protection in
that in some cases surface runoff may never be directed over the
natural area (i.e., if upslope wooded areas are conserved).
(a) Restrictions on the credit.
[1] Natural areas must remain in an undisturbed condition
during and after construction activities. Temporary
incidental land disturbance activities associated with
utility construction may be permitted within the
conservation area.
[2] These areas should be placed in a conservation easement
or similarly enforceable agreement with the Township.
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:545
[3] The limits of the undisturbed area and conservation
easement must be shown on all construction plans.
[4] The area must be located on the development site.
[5] Water quality credits are not permitted for water quality
sensitive (WQS) developments.
[6] The maximum total NAC credit is 50% of the site
impervious area. However, the combination of NAC VFRS
is also 50%.
(b) Sensitive area and development restrictions.
[1] NAC areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive
areas unless the impervious area actually flows across the
area as sheet flow.
[2] Untreated urban runoff from sensitive development types
may not be directed to natural areas without
pretreatment.
(6) Filter/buffer area.
(a) A water quality credit is given when stormwater runoff is
effectively treated via a filter/buffer area or strip. A filter/buffer
area is a vegetated boundary characterized by uniform mild
slopes. Filter strips may be forested or vegetated with turf
grass. Effective treatment is achieved when impervious area
runoff is directed as sheet flow across vegetative filter or buffer
areas (i.e., concentrated flow discharged to a filter strip does
not meet water quality reduction criteria).
(b) The area draining via overland sheet flow to an undisturbed,
natural, vegetated filter strip (natural unmaintained meadow
or forested area) can be subtracted from the site impervious
area (IA) on a 1:1 area ratio in the water quality volume
computation. Impervious areas draining across constructed
(disturbed or regarded) pervious areas can be subtracted from
the site impervious area (IA) on a 1:1/2 area ratio in the water
quality volume computation.
[1] Restrictions on the credit.
[a] The maximum impervious area that can be included in
this credit shall be computed as follows:
IAc = WIA LIA
Where:
IAc = Impervious area recharge credit (L2)
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.4
AO:546
LIA = Length of impervious area measured
perpendicular to the sheet flow
direction (L)
WIA = Width of impervious area (L).
Maximum width permitted for credit is
the smaller of 100 feet or twice the
width of the vegetated filter strip
[b] To qualify for a water quality credit, natural and
constructed filter areas or strips must meet the same
restrictions identified for natural or constructed
recharge areas with regard to width, length, slope,
tributary drainage length, and construction. These
restrictions are presented in Chapter 3.
[c] Runoff shall enter the filter/buffer strip as overland
sheet flow.
[d] Filter/buffer areas shall remain undisturbed/
unmanaged other than to remove accumulated trash
and debris.
[e] Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
[f] The maximum total water quality credit for vegetative
filter/buffer areas is 50% of the site impervious area.
However, the combination of NAC and filter/buffer
areas is also 50%.
[2] Sensitive area and development restrictions.
[a] Untreated urban runoff from WQS developments may
not be directed to filter/buffer areas without
pretreatment.
(7) Comments related to water quality credits.
(a) Concurrence of the Township Engineer is required prior to the
use of all water quality credits for the reduction of the water
quality treatment volume. The Township Engineer may
approve the use of additional credits based upon sufficient
documentation regarding suitability for sensitive development
types and areas, pollutant removal effectiveness, and
maintenance criteria. Multiple water quality credits cannot be
claimed for the identical area of the site (i.e., a stream buffer
credit and disconnecting roof recharge area cannot both be
claimed for the same area).
(b) Additional impervious coverage reduction using low-impact
development techniques (development practices which reduce
the impact of urban runoff such as narrower residential road
§ 13-3.4 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.4
AO:547
§ 13-3.5. Erosion and sedimentation control requirements.
§ 13-3.6. Sinkhole protection.
The use of sinkholes for stormwater management must be carefully planned
because discharging runoff directly into existing sinkholes is not an
engineered stormwater solution. Aside from potential water quality effects,
cover collapse sinkholes that exist throughout the watershed can be
unstable, and it should be assumed that they could stop taking water at any
time. Numerous sinkholes throughout the region already flood during larger
runoff events. Nonetheless, in the watershed, there are large drainage
areas that completely drain to existing sinkholes, and all upslope
development tributary to them cannot be realistically stopped. Therefore,
the following sections have been developed:
sections, smaller culs-de-sac, smaller parking stalls, smaller
building setbacks to reduce driveway lengths, etc.) will also
reduce the required water quality treatment volume. Many
of these techniques require prior approval by the Township
before implementation into land development design.
A. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion and Sediment
Control," and in accordance with the Centre County Conservation
District and the standards and specifications of the appropriate
Township government.
B. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be or are recommended to be applied where recharge
or water quality BMPs are proposed and include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for these BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) These BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until the
entire contributory drainage area to the BMP has received final
stabilization.
C. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
A. Stormwater from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof drains, or
other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged directly into
sinkholes without prior filtration in accordance with Subsection B
below.
B. Sinkholes capable of absorbing substantial amounts of stormwater shall
be protected by diverting such runoff around the sinkhole (refer to
§ 13-3.4 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.6
AO:548
Subsection F) or, upon recommended approval of the Township
Engineer, by planting and maintaining a dense filter path of suitable
vegetative material in such a manner and location to disperse and slow
the runoff to a sheet flow condition to promote the maximum possible
filtration and sedimentation of impurities.
(1) The filter path must be at least 100 feet in length and 20 feet in
width. Ten-foot-wide filter paths are acceptable if land slope is less
than 2%.
(2) Filter paths shall be designed and installed so that they filter sheet
flow rather than concentrated flow. If concentrated flow occurs,
grading and shaping or the use of best management practices such
as grass waterways or drop structures may be required.
(3) Sedimentation basins designed to DEP Chapter 102159 standards or
permanent stormwater storage criteria, whichever is larger, and
proposed vegetative filter paths, in conjunction with temporary
stone filter check dams, shall be installed prior to subdivision or
land development construction activities, where sinkholes are used
to accept stormwater discharges.
C. If increased runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole, even in filtered
conditions, a hydrogeologic assessment of the effects of such runoff on
the increased risk of land subsidence and adverse impacts to existing
sinkhole floodplains and groundwater quality shall be made by a
qualified professional and submitted with the stormwater management
site plan. Such discharge shall be prohibited if the Township Engineer
determines that such poses a hazard to life, property or groundwater
resources.
D. All sinkholes shall be posted by permanent on-site notices clearly visible
at the sinkhole prohibiting any disposal of refuse, rubbish, hazardous
wastes, organic matter or soil into the sinkhole. Rock fill may be
permitted in the sinkhole for the purpose of preventing dumping of said
materials.
E. To protect sensitive karst areas, the Township Engineer may require
basins to contain an impervious liner. The liner may be of the
impervious membrane type, placed in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations, or may be constructed by mixing
bentonite, or an approved alternative, with existing soil available at the
site as approved by the Township Engineer.
F. If it is determined that runoff from upslope developing areas should be
diverted around a sinkhole due to existing problems, the Township
Engineer may require additional upstream volume controls as required
to protect downstream areas.

§ 13-3.6 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.7
AO:549
§ 13-3.7. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
Materials, workmanship and methods. All materials, workmanship and
methods of work shall comply at a minimum with the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Form 408 Specifications, as accepted and
commonly used by the respective Township, and shall be considered to be
incorporated into this chapter as if copied in full. In the event a conflict
arises between the requirements of this chapter and the Form 408
Specifications, the Municipal Engineer shall resolve the difference, and his
opinion shall be binding.
A. General.
(1) Facilities in state rights-of-way. Any stormwater facility located on
state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PA DOT). Any
stormwater facility that discharges directly onto state highway
rights-of-way shall be subject to review by the PA DOT.
(2) Water obstructions. Any facilities that constitute water
obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as directed in PA DEP
Chapter 105 regulations160 (as amended or replaced from time to
time by PA DEP), shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105
and will require a permit from PA DEP. Any other drainage
conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter 105
regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage
structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
with a minimum of 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff
from a one-hundred-year design storm with a minimum of 1.0 foot
of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of
roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as defined in PA DEP
Chapter 105 regulations may require a permit under dam safety
regulations. Any facility located within a PA DOT right-of-way must
meet PA DOT minimum design standards and permit submission
requirements.
(3) Conveyance facilities. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or
channel that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be
able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the return period design storm as specified in
§ 13-3.4D. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater
management facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to
convey the design flow to or from that structure. Roadway
crossings located within designated floodplain areas must be able
to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm. Any facility
160. Editor's Note: See 25 Pa. Code Ch. 105.
§ 13-3.7 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.7
AO:550
located within a PA DOT right-of-way must meet PA DOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements.
B. Stormwater basin design considerations. Stormwater management
basins for the control of stormwater peak discharges shall meet the
following minimum requirements:
(1) The design of all facilities over limestone formations shall include
measures to prevent groundwater contamination and, where
required, sinkhole formation. Soils used for the construction of
basins shall have moderate to low erodibility factors (i.e., "K"
factors of 0.32 or less). Any basin greater than four feet in height,
measured from the top of berm to the downslope toe of the
abutment, must also contain:
(a) Berm soil specifications;
(b) A determination if site soils are available for the construction
of the berm or cutoff trench;
(c) An impervious cutoff trench, which extends the full length of
the downstream berm located in fill.
(2) Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Generally, outlet pipes designed to carry the predevelopment, oneyear
storm flow will be permitted to discharge to a stream with only
an energy dissipater. Discharges to drainage swales shall be spread
with a level spreader or piped to an acceptable point.
(3) Outlet structures.
(a) Outlet structures within detention/retention basins shall be
constructed of reinforced concrete or an approved alternate.
With the exception of those openings designed to carry
perennial stream flows, design openings nine inches or less
shall have nonclogging trash racks, and all openings over 12
inches shall have childproof nonclogging trash racks. Outlet
aprons shall be designed and shall extend at a minimum to the
toe of the basin slope. Where spillways will be used to control
peak discharges in excess of the ten-year storm, the control
weirs shall be constructed to withstand the pressures of
impounded waters and convey flows at computed outlet
velocities without erosion.
(b) All metal risers, where approved for use, shall be suitably
coated to prevent corrosion. A trash rack or similar
appurtenance shall be provided to prevent debris from
entering the riser. All metal risers shall have a concrete base
attached with a watertight connection. The base shall be
sufficient weight to prevent flotation of the riser. An anti-vortex
§ 13-3.7 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.7
AO:551
device, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to the basin
berm, shall be provided on the top of all metal risers.
(4) Emergency spillway.
(a) Stormwater management facilities.
[1] Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow
up to and including the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
conditions. The height of embankment must
be set as to provide a minimum 0.5 foot of freeboard above
the elevation required to safely pass the one-hundred-year
post-development inflow. Should any stormwater
management facility require a dam safety permit under PA
DEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of
Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be
required to pass storms larger than a one-hundred-year
event.
[2] Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows
higher than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year
post-development inflow) without structural failure or
causing downstream harm or safety risks.
[3] Any stormwater management facility that has a paved
roadway as the lower berm should safely convey the onehundred-
year storm under the paved roadway.
(b) Emergency spillways shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete, vegetated earth, or riprap in accordance with
generally accepted engineering practices. All emergency
spillways shall be constructed so that the detention basin berm
is protected against erosion. The minimum capacity of all
emergency spillways shall be the peak flow rate from the onehundred-
year design storm. The dimensions of the emergency
spillways can be determined from the Centre County Erosion
and Sediment Control Handbook. Emergency spillways shall
extend along the upstream and downstream berm
embankment slopes. Protection should be provided on the
upstream embankment a minimum of three feet below the
spillway crest elevation. Protection at the downstream slope of
the spillway shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of the berm
embankment. The emergency spillway shall not be located on
or discharge over uncompacted earthen fill and/or easily
erodible material.
§ 13-3.7 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.7
AO:552
(c) Rock-filled gabions may be used where combination berm and
emergency spillway structures are required to prevent
concentrated flows. The Township Engineer may require the
use of open concrete lattice blocks, stone riprap, or concrete
spillways when slopes would exceed four feet horizontal to one
foot vertical and spillway velocities might exceed Natural
Resources Conservation Service standards for the particular
soils involved.
(5) Antiseep collars. Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the
detention basin berms. The antiseep collars and their connections
to the pipe barrel shall be watertight. The antiseep collars shall
extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the principal
pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between collars shall be 14
times the minimum projection of the collar measured perpendicular
to the pipe.
(6) Slope of detention basin embankment. The top or toe of any slope
shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any property line.
Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Straight side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(a) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical and may be further reduced if
the soil has unstable characteristics.
(b) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical, except with approval of the
Township. Retaining walls will be required if a stable slope
cannot be maintained. All retaining walls shall be designed as
per the procedures outlined in the American Association of
State Highway Officials, Standard Specifications for Highway
Bridges, 1973. Details and calculations prepared and stamped
and signed by a registered professional engineer shall be
submitted to the Township Engineer for any retaining walls
greater than 4 1/2 feet in height.
(c) Where concrete, stone or brick walls are used with side slopes
proposed to be steeper than three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, the basin shall be fenced by a permanent wire (or
other material approved by the Township) fence 42 inches in
height, and a ramp constructed of durable, nonslip material to
a grade of less than 10% for maintenance vehicles shall be
provided for access into the basin.
(7) Width of berm. The minimum top width of detention basin berms
shall be 10 feet.
(8) Slope of basin bottom. In order to ensure proper drainage of the
detention basin, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for all
§ 13-3.7 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.7
AO:553
basins used exclusively for peak runoff control. Water quality or
recharge basins with filtration systems incorporated into them may
have a minimum grade of 0.5%.
(9) The lowest floor elevation of any structure constructed within 50
feet to a detention basin or other stormwater facility shall be two
feet above the detention basin berm. The distance between any
residential structure and any stormwater facility shall be a
minimum of 50 feet. The distance between any nonresidential
structure and any stormwater facility shall be a minimum of 25
feet. The Township Engineer may require fencing at the basin.
(10) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(11) The maximum water depth shall not exceed five feet.
(12) Basin liners.
(a) Basins should be lined with impervious liners only in areas with
a high risk of sinkhole formation or potential groundwater
contamination as determined by a geotechnical engineer.
However, where a liner is deemed necessary or appropriate,
the use of controlled, compacted natural clay liners for SWM
basins should be considered. Locally available clay, when
properly installed, can provide near impervious conditions
(approximately E-6 cm/s or less). Some of the advantages of
using controlled, compacted, natural clay soil liners are:
[1] Can offer better long-term solution as a basin liner versus
geosynthetics because of greater thickness and the ability
to withstand settlement;
[2] Can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage
rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an
excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock;
[3] When properly constructed in two or more eight- to teninch-
thick lifts, rapid movement of surface water through
the clay liner is eliminated (rapid leaks can occur in
geosynthetic lined basins due to poor seaming, punctures,
or other factors);
[4] Cleaning/maintenance of clay-lined stormwater basins will
be easier/safer versus geosynthetic liners which could
easily be damaged during maintenance operations; and
[5] The abundance of clayey soils (derived from limestone
residuum) within the Spring Creek Watershed can provide
adequate, cost-effective, soil resources for construction of
clay liner systems at most development projects.
§ 13-3.7 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.7
AO:554
(b) However, the installation of any low-permeability clay liner
system needs to be carefully controlled, and the designer
needs to ensure that specifications meet standards to ensure
integrity.
C. Construction of basins.
(1) Basins shall be installed prior to or concurrent with any
earthmoving or land disturbances which they will serve. The
phasing of their construction shall be noted in the narrative and on
the plan. Basins that include water quality or recharge components
shall have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(2) Construction specifications in accordance with the minimum
criteria of the Township must be provided for all embankments
pursuant to Subsection B(1) of this section.
(3) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times, with copies being forwarded to the
Township Engineer upon request.
(4) When rock is encountered during the excavation of a pond, it shall
be removed to an elevation of at least 12 inches below the proposed
basin floor (for a manufactured liner, 24 to 30 inches). All exposed
cracks and fissures are to be structurally filled.
(5) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall
be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins within 15
days of construction.
(6) A quality control program is critical for embankment fills.
Therefore, whenever embankment fill material in excess of three
feet is to be used, each layer of compacted fill shall be tested to
determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017. The density of
each layer shall be 98% of a standard proctor density analysis per
ASTM 698.
D. Construction inspection. Inspections may be conducted by the
Township Engineer during the construction of the stormwater
management basin and facilities. Such inspections do not constitute
approval of construction methods or materials. The design professional
shall perform site inspections as may be necessary to ensure that all
stormwater management facilities are constructed in accordance with
the approved plans.
E. Special use basins.
(1) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
§ 13-3.7 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 13-3.7
AO:555
§ 13-3.8. Easements.
Stormwater management facilities located outside of existing or proposed
rights-of-way shall be located within and accessible by easements as
follows:
etc. Provision for permanent wet ponds with stormwater
management capabilities may also be appropriate. Prior approval
and consultation with the Township are required before design.
Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created. Water quality basins or
recharge basins that are designed for a slow release of water or
other extended detention ponds are not permitted for recreational
uses, unless the ponded areas are clearly separated and secure.
(2) Multiple development basins. Stormwater management facilities
designed to serve more than one property or development in the
same watershed are encouraged. Staged construction of existing or
proposed multiple-use detention facilities by several developers in
conjunction with watershed development is encouraged. Each
developer shall be responsible for the incremental increase in
runoff generated by the respective development and incremental
construction improvements necessary for the overall detention
facility. Prior approval and consultation with the Township is
required before design of such facilities.
(3) Alternative detention facilities. Alternative stormwater detention
facilities, including rooftop, subsurface basins or tanks and in-pipe
detention storage, or other approved alternative designs are
permitted as determined by the Township Engineer.
A. Drainage easements. Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement paralleling the line of such watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream. The width of the drainage easement will be
adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage in the
one-hundred-year floodplain, in accordance with computed top widths
for water surface elevations determined under § 13-3.4A(2) of this
chapter.
B. Access easements. Where proposed stormwater management facilities
are not adjacent to proposed or existing public rights-of-way or are not
accessible due to physical constraints, as determined by the Township
Engineer, a twenty-foot-wide passable access easement specifying
rights of entry shall be provided. Access easements shall provide for
vehicle ingress and egress on grades of less than 10% for carrying out
inspection or maintenance activities.
C. Maintenance easements. A maintenance easement shall be provided
which encompasses the stormwater facility and appurtenances and
provides for access for maintenance purposes. The maintenance
§ 13-3.7 HARRIS CODE § 13-3.8
AO:556
§ 13-3.9. Prohibited discharges and connections.
Nonstormwater discharges are to be regulated as noted below. In general,
nonstormwater discharges are prohibited from entering any portion of
the municipal separate storm sewer system or any waters of the
commonwealth, except as noted below:
easement must be located outside of the one-hundred-year surface
elevation and the stormwater facility and appurtenances.
D. Easements shall stipulate that no trees, shrubs, structures, excavation
or fill be placed and no regrading be performed within the area of the
easement without written approval from the Township upon review by
the Township Engineer. Upon approval of the Township Engineer, such
landscaping may be placed in maintenance easements, provided it does
not impede access.
E. Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel with and conjunctive
to property lines of the subdivision.
F. All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the site plan. The format and content
of the easement agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the
Township Engineer and Solicitor. (See § 13-7.4.)
G. When stormwater conveyance pipes or channels are located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within a drainage easement not
less than 20 feet wide as approved by the Township Engineer.
A. Prohibited discharges.
(1) No person in the Township shall allow, or cause to allow,
stormwater discharges into the Township's storm sewer system
which are not composed entirely of stormwater, except as provided
in Subsection A(2) below and discharges allowed under a state or
federal permit.
(2) Discharges that may be allowed, based on a finding by the
Township, as determined by the Township Engineer, that the
discharge(s) do not significantly contribute to pollution of surface
waters of the commonwealth, are:
(a) Discharges from firefighting activities.
(b) Potable water sources, including dechlorinated waterline and
fire hydrant flushings.
(c) Irrigation drainage.
(d) Routine external building washdown (which does not use
detergents or other compounds).
(e) Air-conditioning condensate.

AO:557
(f) Water from individual residential car washing.
(g) Springs.
(h) Water from crawl space pumps.
(i) Uncontaminated water from foundation or from footing drains.
(j) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
(k) Lawn watering.
(l) Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill
material has been removed) and where detergents are not
used.
(m) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.
(n) Uncontaminated groundwater.
(o) Diverted stream flow.
(p) Uncontaminated pumped groundwater.
(3) In the event that the Township determines that any of the
discharges identified in Subsection A(2) above significantly
contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth, or is so
notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (PA DEP), the Township will notify the responsible
person to cease the discharge.
(4) Upon notice provided by the Township under Subsection A(3)
above, the discharger will have a reasonable time, as determined
by the Township, to cease the discharge consistent with the degree
of pollution caused by the discharge.
(5) Nothing in this section shall affect a discharger's responsibilities
under state law.
B. Prohibited connections. The following connections are prohibited,
except as provided in Subsection A(2) above:
(1) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface,
which allows any nonstormwater discharge, including sewage,
process wastewater, and wash water, to enter the storm sewer
system and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor
drains and sinks.
(2) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the storm sewer system which has not been
documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by
the Township.
