FOREWORD



History1



   In the early 1730's, German immigrants settled in the area now known as
Myerstown. On early maps Myerstown was called Herclerode, after the first
landowner, Mr. Valentine Herclerode. The Herclerode house still stands on
South College Street, and is known as the Isaac Meier House.



   Mr. Isaac Meier married Mr. Herclerode’s daughter, Catherine, and
bought the home and plantation.



   The home is located near the Tulpehocken Creek and the town was later
known as Tulpehocken Town. Tulpehocken is a Lenape Indian word which means
“land of the turtles.” Mr. Meier laid out the streets for his town in
1768.



   In July of 1770, Mr. Meier was shot and killed in a local tavern and
his murderer was never found. After Mr. Meier died, his town gradually became
known as Meier- Town, in tribute to him. After awhile, the spelling of the
name took on an English form of Myer rather than the German form of Meier.



   Many of the early homes in the Myerstown area were built of limestone
or logs. Examples of these original buildings can still be seen on Main
Avenue, South Railroad Street and South Cherry Street.



   During the 1820's, a part the Union Canal ran right through the
Borough. Utilizing the streams of the area, eight canal locks were
constructed and canal boats were built locally. This helped Myerstown to
flourish and soon factories, hotels, and stores sprang up in the vicinity.



   Then, in the 1850's the Lebanon Valley Railroad was built south of the
Union Canal, which brought more prosperity to Myerstown. After the Civil War,
horse-trading was a large business in Myerstown, which spun-off to other
businesses. Palatinate College as started and later became Albright College
and is now the Evangelical School of Theology.



   During the American Civil War, many young men volunteered to fight for
their beliefs. Several of the many heros of the Union forces were born and
raised in Myerstown. One of these heros was Color Sgt. Henry Brehm of the 149
Pennsylvania Regiment. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg on
July 1, 1863 and died of his wounds in August of that year. Sgt. Brehm ‘s
body was returned to his home and is buried in the Union Cemetery on
Washington Avenue.



   The Borough of Myerstown was incorporated February 5, 1912 and held
it’s first Council meeting on March 22 of the same year in the High School
Building. The first Council members were: Henry Coal, President; John Donges;
James Kolbach; Isaac Haak; Monroe Haak; Samuel Beckey and Joseph Painter. The
Mayor was Addison Bowen. The population was 2335 and the assessed valuation
of all properties was $1,198,875. Some of the original businesses are still
operated in Myerstown ... over a hundred years of service to the community.
Examples include: Bahney’s Furniture, Wilhelm’s Hardware and Kohl
Brothers Well Drilling/Pumps.



   The ethnic diversity of Myerstown is manifested in the architecture of
the early German immigrants, the canal and railroad dug by the Irish and the
stonework in the quarries by the Italians.



   In this day and age of speed and anonymity, the Borough of Myerstown
maintains its “small town” atmosphere where neighbors know each other and
cheerful greetings are shared everyday.



   The Code of Ordinances of the Borough of  Myerstown was prepared by
Keystate Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Borough of Myerstown Borough
Council on December 10, 2013, by Ord. 818.



Organization



   The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances
of the Borough of Myerstown contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the
Appendix, which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or
“one time” nature, (3) the Table to the disposition of each ordinance
ever enacted by the Borough of Myerstown, and (4) the Index, which is an
alphabetical arrangement of subjects.



   In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not
known in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of
several general categories containing a chronological listing of short
subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its
date of enactment, if known.



   The Table to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the
Borough of Myerstown Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever
enacted. An ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2)
superseded by another ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code
book, or (4) is located in the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget
ordinances are located only in the Table. The Table is a cross reference to
the original ordinance books of the Borough of Myerstown, and to the location
within the Code of each ordinance by number.

to the lesser of the fee for duplication on paper or the fee for duplication
in the original media unless the requester specifically requests for the
record to be duplicated in the more expensive medium. (§ 1307(e)).
 


      postage fees
 
fees for postage may not exceed the actual costs of mailing


      Please Also Be Advised
 


      Statutory Fees. If a separate statute authorizes an agency to
charge a set amount for a certain type of record, the agency may charge no
more than that statutory amount. For example, a Recorder of Deeds may charge
a copy fee of $.50 per uncertified page and $1.50 per certified page under 42
P.S. § 21051. Police departments have the authority to charge up to $15 per
report for providing a copy of a vehicle accident report, 75 Pa.C.S. §
3751(b)(2). Philadelphia police may charge up to $25 per copy, Id. at (b)(3).
State police are authorized to charge “$5 for each copy of the Pennsylvania
State Police full report of investigation,” 75 Pa.C.S § 1956(b).


      Inspection of Redacted Records. If a requester wishes to inspect
rather than receive a copy of a record and the record contains both public
and non-public information, the agency shall redact the non-public
information. An agency may not charge the requester for the redaction.
However, the agency may charge for the copies it must make of the redacted
material in order for the requester to view the public record. The fee
structure outlined above will apply. If, after inspecting the records, the
requester chooses to obtain the copies, no additional fee may be charged.


      Enhanced Electronic Access. If an agency offers enhanced
electronic access to records in addition to making the records accessible for
inspection and duplication by a requester, the agency may establish user fees
specifically for the provision of the enhanced electronic access, but only to
the extent that the enhanced electronic access is in addition to making the
records accessible for inspection and duplication by a requester as required
by this Act. The user fees for enhanced electronic access may be a flat rate,
a subscription fee for a period of time, a per-transaction fee, a fee based
on the cumulative time of system access or any other reasonable method and
any combination thereof. The user fees for enhanced electronic access must be
reasonable, must be pre-approved by the Office of Open Records and shall not
be established with the intent or effect of excluding persons from access to
records or duplicates thereof or of creating profit for the agency. Please
submit any request to the Office of Open Records, 400 North Street,
Harrisburg, PA 17120.


      Fee Limitations. Except as otherwise provided by statue, the law
states that no other fees may be imposed unless the agency necessarily incurs
costs for complying with the request, and such fees must be reasonable. No
fee may be imposed for an agency's review of a record to determine whether
the record is a public record, legislative record or financial record subject
to access in accordance with this Act. No fee may be charged for searching
for or retrieval of documents. An agency may not charge staff time or salary
for complying with a Right to Know request.


      Prepayment. Prior to granting a request for access in accordance
with this Act, an agency may require a requester to prepay an estimate of the
fees authorized under this Section if the fees required to fulfill the
request are expected to exceed $100.


         Once the request is fulfilled and prepared for release, the
Office of Open Records recommends that the agency obtain the cost of the
records prior to releasing the records. This recommendation is designed to
avoid situations in which the agency provides the records and the requester
fails to submit payment.

(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-104.   Headings.



   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph,
Subparagraph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the
Code. The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code
are intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section,
Subsection or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of
such Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.



   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the
present tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the
present; the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine
includes the masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and

(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-106.   Construction.



   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any
provision of this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 1501 et seq., shall be applied in construing this Code.



   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.



      A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its
expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any
right accrued or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred,
or any proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance
expired.



      B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section,
ordinance, clause or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall
not be construed to revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or
provision, unless it shall be expressly so provided.



   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are
the same as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to
the adoption of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances,
resolutions and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of
this Code shall not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be
instituted to enforce any of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as
specifically stated in this Code or in the ordinance adopting this
consolidation, codification and revision of the ordinances and regulations,
it is the intention of the Borough Council that no ordinance or regulation of
the Borough be amended, revised or repealed by implication.



   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may
contain resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form
and designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 45101 et seq.,
at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been
included herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council
that such actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code
and specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an
ordinance (requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or
repeal) by the simple fact of inclusion in this Code.



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.



   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic
throughout this Code.



   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout
this Code.



   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be
divided into Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter
or Part number followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be
divided into Subchapters 1A and 1B.



   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a
Chapter and a Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter
number, followed by a hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the
Section number within the Part. For example, "§ 1-101” designates Chapter
1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly, “§ 27-305” designates Chapter 27, Part
3, Section 5.



   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:



   1.   Subsection.



      A.   Paragraph.



         (1)   Subparagraph.

               (1)   Subclause.



                  (a)   Item.



                     i.   Subitem.



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.



   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes
necessary to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing
Chapters, Parts or Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be
designated by the addition of a capital letter suffix to the preceding
Chapter, Part or Section number. Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters
5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and Sections in that Chapter would be numbered,
for instance, “§ 5A-101.” If it becomes necessary to introduce a Part
between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new Part would be Part 5A and Sections in
that Part would be numbered, for instance, “§ 5-5A01.” A new Section
introduced between existing Sections 5 and 6 would be “§ 5-105A.” When a
number of new Parts or Sections have been introduced the Chapter or Part
shall be renumbered.



   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between
Subsections, for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be
numbered Subsection .5-A.



   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a
Subsection between existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and
renumbered.



   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation
or repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-109.   Amending Code.



   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code
which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion
herein. In the case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs,
Clauses or other part or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such
repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted
pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or
omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such
subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances
omitted are readopted as a new Code by the Borough Council.



   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by
specific reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of
this Code in the following language:



      A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter       , Part      
, Section       , Subsection       , is hereby amended (revised) to
read as follows . . . .” The amended or revised provisions may then be set
out in full as desired.



      B.   Addition. "Chapter       , Part       , Section  
    , Subsection       , is hereby amended by the addition of the
following . . . .” The new provision shall then be set out in full as
desired.



      C.   Repeal. "Chapter       , Part       , Section    
  , Subsection       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”



   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering
scheme of this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event
that any ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to
the numbering system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that such enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising
or updating this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The
Borough Council hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme
herein is for ease of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment
when added to this Code shall not in any manner affect the validity of said
enactment.



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-110. Altering Code.



   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.



(Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 1-111.   Penalties.



   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in
any ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be
unlawful, or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is
declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor:



      A.   Violations of Health, Safety and Welfare Provisions. For
violations of ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance,
health, fire or public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water
services, water pollution, air pollution and noise, the following penalty
shall be provided:



         (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate
any provision of this Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought
before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided for the
enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal
Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus
costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part
continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have been
violated shall constitute a separate offense.



      B.   Other Violations. All other penalties, except for
penalties in Chapter 15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the
Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted
under the authority of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq., earned income tax ordinances adopted under the Local Tax Enabling Act,
53 P.S. § 6913, and ordinances adopted under authority of the Sewage
Facilities Act, 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq., should provide, generally:



         (1)   Any person, partnership, or corporation who or
which has violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this Part,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced
by the Borough, shall pay a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court
costs and reasonable attorney fees. No judgment shall commence or be imposed,
levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by a
magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals
the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues or each Section
of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a
separate violation.



   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code
shall not prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of
other punitive or remedial action where called for or permitted under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In
addition, the Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other
appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of
this Code. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue
restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other
appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

§ 4-101.   Definitions and Interpretation.



   1.   The word “building,” as used in this Part, shall mean any
structure used or intended to be used as a dwelling or as a place of business
or industry, but need not include any public building or any structure built
as a place of worship, or any accessory building located upon a lot where
there is also a main building.



   2.   In this Part, the singular shall include the plural, the plural

the neuter.



(Ord. 495, 4/16/1969, § 1)



§ 4-102.   Adoption of Numbering Plan.



   The numbering plan for buildings, on file in the Borough Office, with
any changes, supplements, and/or additions hereafter adopted, is hereby
adopted as the official numbering plan for buildings in the said Borough.
Such plan shall begin at Main Avenue and Railroad Street, with even numbers
assigned to all buildings on the east or south side of a street, odd numbers
assigned to all buildings on the west or north side of a street. Upon all
streets not running in a generally east-west or north-south direction or in
any way not conforming to the prevalent pattern of street arrangements in the
Borough, numbers shall be assigned by the Borough Manager, at frequencies
conforming to that in the official numbering plan herein above referred to,
as closely as practicable to the numbers used upon neighboring streets
running in an approximately parallel direction, or, if the latter shall not
be practicable, in the manner that the Borough Manager deems will provide a
most logical means of locating the property.



(Ord. 495, 4/16/1969, § 2)



§ 4-103.   Duty of Property Owners.



   It shall be the duty of the owner of every building in the Borough to
number such building with the officially assigned number. Such number shall
be affixed to or painted upon or carved upon such building or upon a
permanent standard, base, or support located between such building and the
street. Each digit of a number shall be at least 3 inches high, shall be of
such color and material as to be visible from the street, and shall be
constantly maintained by the property owner in complete and legible form. In
addition, it shall be the duty of the owner of every building in the Borough
to number such building in a manner that the number assigned to said building
shall be visible from any alley or alleys upon which the lot upon which said
building is situated fronts. The property owner shall re-affix or renew all
numbers that shall not continue to conform to the requirements of this
Section. Provided: in the case of buildings hereafter erected in the Borough,
the owner thereof shall be required to affix the officially assigned number
thereto before the first occupancy of such building.

   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this
Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial
district judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses
under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay
a fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said
fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day
that a violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which
shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.

Part 7
Loitering and Prowling



§ 6-701.   Loitering and Prowling Prohibited under Certain Circumstances.



   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a
time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity.



      A.   Among the circumstances which may be considered in
determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes
flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or
herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.



      B.   As a procedural condition to conviction, if practicable
and unless flight by the actor or other circumstance makes it impracticable,
a police officer shall, before any arrest under this Section, afford the
actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise by warranted,
by requesting that actor to identify himself or herself and explain his or
her presence and conduct. Also, no person shall be convicted of an offense
under this Section if it appears at the hearing that the explanation given by
the actor was true and, if believed by the police officer at the time, would
have dispelled the alarm.



(Ord. 671, 1/14/1986, § 1)



§ 6-702.   Lingering at or about Specific Facilities Prohibited under

invitee or licensee, it shall be unlawful for any person to linger in or
about, and for a purpose unconnected with lawful activity related to,
facilities of a restricted public nature, including a store, school, bus
stop, the post office, any Borough property, or any place of public worship,
or any parking area serving any such facility of a restricted public nature.
Such specific places shall be deemed to include, to the fullest extent
permitted as reasonable under all the circumstances, any point within 100
feet of such a place or facility for the effective dispelling of alarm for
safety of persons or property, prevention of disruption of activities in
which such facilities specialize, and minimizing of trespassing or
trespassing from the beginning.

   On any public street, including sidewalks along a street (and walls,
steps, or points immediately adjacent to a street so as to minimize evasion)
it shall be unlawful for three or more persons as a group, or as interacting
individuals or groups, to linger for more than 10 minutes under circumstances
that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.



      A.   A police officer, acting reasonably and objectively, may
warn those persons to disperse.



      B.   If reasonably necessary to dispel any alarm which would
otherwise be warranted, a police officer may clear the area of those persons,
causing those who refuse or fail to leave to be taken to the police station.
At the police station, the officer on duty shall ascertain relevant facts,
under constitutional safeguards, and assume centralized responsibility for
accurate, effective, fair, impartial, and uniform enforcement. Those persons
may thereupon be permitted to return, or be escorted, to their respective
homes if such action is consonant with dispelled alarm for the safety of
persons or property in the area affected. The officer shall promptly, within
24 hours, file a written report with the Chief or other person or official in
charge of the police force.



      C.   As a last resort for effective crowd control, after
consultation with the Mayor, proceedings may be instituted before the
magisterial district judge under this Section. [Ord. 818]

securing the building or other structure, and the designated officer shall
return the amount of the funds transferred to the Borough in excess of the
estimate to the named insured, if the Borough has not commenced to remove,
repair, or secure the building or other structure.



      E.   Upon receipt of proceeds under this Section, the Borough
shall do the following:

legal or administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with such
removal, repair, or securing of the building or any proceedings related
thereto.

transferring the proceeds to provide the Borough with the name and address of
the named insured. Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the name and
address of the named insured, the designated officer shall contact the name
insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the Borough and
notify the name insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be
followed.



         (3)   When repairs, removal, or securing of the building
or other structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable
regulations and orders of the Borough and the required proof of such
completion received by the designated officer, and if the Borough has not
incurred any costs for repairs, removal, or securing, the fund shall be
returned to the named insured. If the Borough has incurred costs for repairs,
removal, or securing of the building, or other structures, the costs shall be
paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the Borough shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured.



         (4)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds
held by the Borough pursuant to this Section, and not returned to the named
insured, such interest shall belong to the Borough. To the extent that
proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds
shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds are
returned.



      F.   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the
ability of the Borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in
this Subsection shall be construed to prohibit the Borough and the named
insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to
the named insured or some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.

§ 10-401.   Finding and Purpose.



   The Borough Council of the Borough of Myerstown finds and declares that
the accumulation of storage of garbage, or rubbish within the Borough of
Myerstown represents a unique danger to the health, welfare, and safety of
the residents of Myerstown Borough. In particular, the storage of refuse,
garbage, or rubbish can and will, if not properly controlled, result in
traffic hazards, dangers from fire, and explosion, threats to the safety of
children and incompetents, provide breeding places for insects, vermin,
rodents, and other animals, create substantial risks of pollution of surface
and subsurface waters within the Borough, create unique problems for law
enforcement and firefighting and require that the Borough engage in
additional expense for the supervision and regulation of any such place which
accumulate or store junk, refuse, garbage, or rubbish. The Borough Council
further finds that the said dangers to the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Borough of Myerstown require the regulation of the storage
and accumulation of refuse, garbage, or rubbish within the Borough.

but need not, include a requirement for furnishing a bond or a public
liability insurance policy which shall save the Borough harmless from any
injury or damages resulting from the holding of such circus or carnival in
the Borough.

separate offense. [Ord. 818]

tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has
submitted a cost-of- service showing which justified the rate charged as
reasonable. Before ordering such a refund, however, the Borough shall give
the operator notice, and shall give the operator 15 days from the date such
notice is given to submit written comments to the Borough. Any such refund
order shall be further subject to the limitations contained in the Federal
Law.



   6.   Penalties.

(Ord. 758, 5/14/1996, § 12)



§ 13-613.   Customer Service Regulation Provisions.



   1.   Federal Minimum Customer Service Standards Adopted. It is the
intent of the Borough to enforce the following minimum customer service
standards as established by the Federal Law:



      A.   Cable system office hours and telephone availability:



         (1)   The cable operator will maintain a local,
toll-free, or collect call telephone access line which will be available to
its subscribers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.



            (a)   Trained company representatives will be
available to respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business
hours.



            (b)   After normal business hours, the access line
may be answered by a service or an automated response system, including an
answering machine. Inquiries received after normal business hours must be
responded to by a trained company representative on the next business day.



         (2)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone
answer time by a customer representative, including wait time, shall not
exceed 30 seconds when the connection is made. If the call needs to be
transferred, transfer time shall not exceed 30 seconds. These standards shall
be met no less than 90 percent of the time under normal operating conditions,
measured on a quarterly basis.



         (3)   The operator will not be required to acquire
equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone
answering standards above unless an historical record of complaints indicates
a clear failure to comply.



         (4)   Under normal operating conditions, the customer
will receive a busy signal less than 3 percent of the time.



         (5)   Customer service center and bill payment locations
will be open at least during normal business hours and will be conveniently
located.



      B.   Installations, Outages, and Service Calls. Under normal
operating conditions, each of the following four standards will be met no
less than 95 percent of the time measured on a quarterly basis:



         (1)   Standard installations will be performed within 7
business days after an order has been placed. “Standard” installations
are those that are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution
system.



         (2)   Excluding conditions beyond the control of the
operator, the cable operator will begin working on “service
interruptions” promptly and in no event later than 24 hours after the
interruption becomes known. The cable operator must begin actions to correct
other service problems the next business day after notification of the
service problem.



         (3)   The “appointment window” alternatives for
installations, service calls, and other installation activities will be
either a specific time or, at maximum, a 4-hour time block during normal
business hours. (The operator may schedule service calls and other
installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express
convenience of the customer.)



         (4)   An operator may not cancel an appointment with a
customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the
scheduled appointment.



         (5)   If a cable operator representative is running late
for an appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the
appointment as scheduled, the customer will be contacted. The appointment
will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the
customer.



      C.   Communications Between Cable Operators and Cable
Subscribers:



         (1)   Notification to Subscribers:



            (a)   The cable operator shall provide written
information on each of the following areas at the time of installation of
service, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon request:



               (1)   Products and services offered.



               (2)   Prices and options for programming
services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services.



               (3)   Installation and service maintenance
policies.



               (4)   Instructions on how to use the cable
service.



               (5)   Channel positions of programming
carried on the system.



               (6)   Billing and complaint procedures,
including the address and telephone number of the local franchise
authority’s cable office.



            (b)   Billing.



               (1)   Bills will be clear, concise, and
understandable. Bills must be fully itemized, with itemizations including,
but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges.
Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period,
including optional charges, rebates, and credits.



               (2)   In case of a billing dispute, the
cable operator must respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within
30 days.



            (c)   Refunds.



               (1)   The customer’s next billing cycle
following resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is earlier.



               (2)   The return of the equipment supplied
by the cable operator if service is terminated.



            (d)   Credits. Credits for service will be issued
no later than the customer’s next billing cycle following the determination
that a credit is warranted.



   2.   Enforcement. In furtherance thereof, the compliance officer, 90
days after giving notice to the cable operators of the Borough’s intent to
enforce these standards, shall have the authority and responsibility to
enforce these standards to the fullest extent permitted by the Federal Law
and in accordance with all substantive and procedural requirements of the
Federal Law. In furtherance thereof, the compliance officer may make any and
all such orders and assess any and all such penalties for violations of these
standards as are permitted by the Federal Law, subject to the oversight and
control of Borough Council, including, without limitation:



      A.   Ordering the cable operator to pay credits or refunds to
the subscribers to the cable operator system.



      B.   Filing suit against a cable operator to compel specific
performance.



      C.   Conducting performance evaluations at the time of renewal
of the cable operator’s franchise agreement.



   3.   The cable operator shall, under normal conditions, respond to
all service calls within 24 hours and correct malfunctions as promptly as
possible and shall maintain a competent staff sufficient to provide adequate
and prompt service to its subscribers.



   4.   Other Customer Service Standards Not Affected. All other
customer service standards, whether established by franchise agreement, State
law or regulation, or local ordinance, and whether now or hereafter enacted,
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that such other customer
service standards are not preempted by the Federal Law.



   5.   Fees, Penalties/Fines, and Franchise Fee/Commissions. All
penalties/fines and franchise fee/commissions shall be set by the Myerstown
Borough Council by Resolution.

pretreatment of industrial wastes.



         (14)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized
by the Pretreatment Coordinator in a wastewater discharge permit.



         (15)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with
other sources, the treatment plant’s effluent to fail a toxicity test.



         (16)   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other
substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.



         (17)   Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable
origin in concentrations greater than 100 mg/L.



   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section shall
not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to
the POTW.



   2.   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The National
categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405–471, are hereby incorporated.



   3.   State Pretreatment Standards. No State pretreatment standards
exist so, in their place, categorical pretreatment standards are hereby
incorporated.



   4.   Local Limits. The following pollutant limits are established to
protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge
wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum
allowable discharge limits:



      A.   900mg/L–BOD5.



      B.   0.200 mg/L–cadmium.



      C.   2.67 mg/L–chromium.



      D.   1.00 mg/L–copper.



      E.   2.83 mg/L–cyanide.



      F.   2.00 mg/L–lead.



      G.   0.00 mg/L–mercury.



      H.   2.00 mg/L–nickel.



      I.   100 mg/L–oil and grease (petroleum or mineral oil
products).



      J.   2.00 mg/L–silver.



      K.   750 mg/L–total suspended solids.



      L.   2.55 mg/L–zinc.



      M. 0.37 mg/L–tin.



      N.   10.00 mg/L–iron.



      O.   0.80 mg/L–phenol.



      P.   0.025 mg/L–arsenic.



      Q.   1,500 mg/L–total dissolved solids.



      R.   19.8 mg/L–phosphorus.



      S.   75 mg/L–ammonia nitrogen.



      T.   0.09 mg/L–selenium.



   The above limits may be revised by resolution of the Myerstown Borough
Council.



   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW (end of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are
for “total” metal unless indicated otherwise. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the
concentration-based limitations above.



   Deductions will be made from these limited substances equal to the
concentrations of each substance that is contained in the potable water
supply.



   5.   Borough’s Right of Revision. The Borough reserves the right
to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or require ments on discharges to the POTW.



   6.   Special Agreement. The Borough reserves the right to enter into
special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, a user may request a
net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15. A user also may request a variance from the categorical pretreatment
standard from the approval authority. Such a request will be approved only if
the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that
categorical pretreatment standard. A user requesting a fundamentally
different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.



   7.   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water,
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The Pretreatment Coordinator may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 2)



§ 18-303.   Pretreatment of Wastewater.



   1.   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater
treatment as necessary to comply with this ordinance and shall achieve
compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the
prohibitions set out in § 18-302.1 of this Part within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the State, or the Pretreatment Coordinator, whichever
is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing
such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Pretreatment Coordinator before such facilities are constructed. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the Borough under the provisions of this Part.



   2.   Additional Pretreatment Measures. The Borough may provide legal
authority to do the following:



      A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the Pretreatment Coordinator
may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the
requirements of this Part.



      B.   Each person discharging into the POTW greater than 25,000
gallons per day or greater than 5 percent of the average daily flow in the
POTW, whichever is less, shall install and maintain, on his property and at
his expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure
equalization of flow over a 24-hour period. The facility shall have a
capacity for at least 50 percent of the daily discharge volume and shall be
equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of
which shall be directed by the Pretreatment Coordina tor. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.



      C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided
when, in the opinion of the Pretreatment Coordinator, they are necessary for
the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and
oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity
approved by the Pretreatment Coordinator and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his expense.



      D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable
substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible
gas detection meter.



   3.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. At least once every 2
years the Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each significant
industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:



      A.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine
batch discharges.



      B.   Description of stored chemicals.



      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any
accidental or sludge discharge, as required by § 18-306.7 of this Part.



      D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response.



   4.   Hauled Wastewater. Hauled waste will not be accepted into the
POTW.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 3)



§ 18-304.   Fees and Charges.



   1.   Times and Methods of Payment. Strength of wastes surcharges
shall be due and be paid quarterly and quarterly billings for strength of
wastes surcharges shall be made by bills dated during January, April, July,
and October of each year, for the quarterly calendar period immediately
preceding the date of the bill. The bills for strength of wastes surcharges
for the first quarter during which a property discharges strong wastes into
the sewer system shall be prorated on the basis of the quarterly rate. All
bills shall be due and payable on their respective dates. The Borough may
include strength of wastes surcharges on the quarterly sewer rental bills of
the Borough of Myerstown, and need not, in such cases, make separate bills
for strength of wastes surcharges. The strong waste surcharge formula will be
updated annually using current operation and maintenance costs and wasteload
quantities to reflect actual costs to remove specific pollutants.



   2.   Extraordinary Maintenance Charge. Any person discharging any
waste, which, in the judgment of the Borough, causes any extraordinary
maintenance expenses shall be billed by the Borough in the amount of, said
expenses. The billing amount shall be determined by the Borough and shall
include charges for labor of Borough personnel and other costs incurred by
the Borough.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 4)



§ 18-305.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Application.



   1.   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Pretreatment
Coordinator, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics
of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The Pretreatment Coordinator
is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
users to update this information.



   2.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.



      A.   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater
into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the
Pretreatment Coordinator, except that a significant industrial user that has
filed a timely application pursuant to § 18-305.3 of this Part may continue
to discharge for the time period specified therein.



      B.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require other users to
obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Part. A fee for other user discharge would follow the schedule
established by resolution of Borough Council.



      C.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and subjects
the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§ 18-311
through 18-313 of this Part. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law.



   3.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; Existing Conditions. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging
wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this Part and who
wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 30 days after
said date, apply to the Pretreatment Coordinator for a wastewater discharge
permit in accordance with § 18-305.5 of this Part, and shall not cause or
allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days of the effective date
of this Part except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued
by the Pretreatment Coordinator.



   4.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; New Connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or
recommence discharg ing into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the
beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this
wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with § 18-305.5 of this Part,
must be filed at least 30 days prior to the date upon which any discharge
will begin or recommence.



   5.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents. All users
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit
application. The Pretreatment Coordinator may require all users to submit as
part of an application the following information:



      A.   All information required by § 18-307.1.B of this Part.



      B.   Description of activities, facilities, and plant
processes on the premises, including a list of all raw materials and
chemicals used or stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or
intentionally be, discharged to the POTW.



      C.   Number and type of employees, hours of operation, and
proposed or actual hours of operation.

      G.   Time and duration of discharges.



      H.   Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the
Pretreatment Coordinator to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit
application.



      I.   An application fee, in an amount as established from time
to time by resolution of Borough Council, to be paid upon submitting a
completed permit application. [Ord. 818]



   Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision.



   6.   Application Signatories and Certification. All wastewater
discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by an
authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification
statement:



      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”



   7.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions. The Pretreatment
Coordinator will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information. Within 30 days of receipt of a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, the Pretreatment Coordinator will determine

(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 5; as amended by Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 18-306.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Issuance Process.



   1.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration. A wastewater discharge
permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed 5 years
from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be
issued for a period less than 5 years, at the discretion of the Pretreatment
Coordinator. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date
upon which it will expire.



   2.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Contents. A wastewater discharge
permit shall include such conditions as are reasonably deemed necessary by
the Pretreatment Coordinator to prevent pass through or interference, protect
the quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant’s effluent,
protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal,
and protect against damage to the POTW.



      A.   Wastewater discharge permits must contain the following

   3.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals. Any person, including the
user, may petition Borough Council to reconsider the terms of a wastewater
discharge permit within 30 days of its issuance.



      A.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be
deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.



      B.   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the
wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the

business ownership of a permitted facility.



      M.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or
any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this Part.



   Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of
operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge
permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new
wastewater discharge permit to that user.



   7.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user with an expiring
wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with §
18-305.6 of this Part, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the
user’s existing wastewater discharge permit. An application fee, in an
amount as established from time to time by resolution of Borough Council,
shall be submitted along with the completed permit application. [Ord. 818]



   8.   Municipal Wastewater Discharge Permits. In the event another
municipality contributes all or a portion of its wastewater to the POTW, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may require such municipality to apply for and
obtain a municipal wastewater discharge permit.



      A.   A municipal wastewater discharge permit application shall
include:



         (1)   A description of the quality and volume of the
wastewater at the point(s) where it enters the POTW.



         (2)   An inventory of all users discharging to the
municipality.



         (3)   Such other information as may be required by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.



         (4)   An application fee, in an amount as established
from time to time by resolution of Borough Council, to be submitted along
with the completed permit application. [Ord. 818]



      B.   A municipal wastewater discharge permit shall contain the
following conditions:



         (1)   A requirement for the municipal user to adopt a
sewer use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this Part and local
limits which are at least as stringent as those set out in § 18-302.4 of
this Part. Such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect
changes made to the Borough’s sewer use ordinance and/or local limits.



         (2)   A requirement for the municipal user to submit a
revised user inventory on at least an annual basis.



         (3)   A requirement for the municipal user to conduct
pretreatment implementation activities including wastewater discharge permit
issuance, inspection and sampling, and enforcement; or authorize the POTW to
take or conduct such activities on its behalf.



         (4)   A requirement for the municipal user to provide
the Pretreatment Coordinator with access to all information that the
municipal user obtains as part of its pretreatment activities.



         (5)   Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the
municipal user’s wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW.



         (6)   Requirements for monitoring the municipal user’s
discharge.



         (7)   A provision ensuring the Pretreatment Coordinator
access to the facilities of users located in the municipal user’s
jurisdiction for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties
deemed necessary by the Pretreat ment Coordinator.



      C.   Violation of the terms and conditions of the municipal
user’s wastewater discharge permit subjects the municipal user to the
sanctions set out in §§ 18-311 through 18-313 of this Part.



   9.   Commercial Wastewater Discharge Permit. In the event that a
commercial user contributes all or a portion of its wastewater to the POTW,
the Pretreatment Coordinator may require such commercial user to apply for
and obtain a commercial wastewater discharge permit. The Borough may require
a commercial user to have a discharge permit, if in the opinion of the
Borough it is necessary, in order for the Borough to operate and maintain the
POTW and meet its NPDES requirements.



      A.   A commercial wastewater discharge permit application
shall include:



         (1)   A description of the quality and volume of the
wastewater at the point where it enters the POTW.

user’s wastewater discharge permit subjects the commercial user to the
sanctions set out in §§ 18-312 through 18-314 of this Part.



   10.   Special Use Discharge Permit. In the event that a user
contributes all or a portion of its wastewater to the POTW and the user is
not considered industrial, commercial, or domestic, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may require such user to apply for and obtain a special use
discharge permit. The Borough may require a user to have a special use
discharge permit, if in the opinion of the Borough it is necessary, in order
to operate and maintain the POTW and meet its NPDES requirements.



      A.   A special use discharge permit application shall include:



         (1)   A description of the quality and volume of the
wastewater at the point where it enters the POTW.



         (2)   Such information as may be required by the
Pretreatment Coordina tor.



         (3)   An application fee, in an amount as established
from time to time by resolution of Borough Council, to be submitted along
with the completed application. [Ord. 818]

         (4)   A provision ensuring the Pretreatment Coordinator
access to the user’s facility during normal hours of business for the
purpose of inspection and sampling.



      C.   Violations of the terms and conditions of the special use
discharge permit subjects the special user to the sanctions set out in §§
18-312 through 18-314 of this Part.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 6; as amended by Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 18-307.   Reporting Requirements.



   1.   Baseline Monitoring Reports.



      A.   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreat ment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4) (whichever is later) existing
categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall be required to submit to the Pretreatment Coordinator a report
which contains the information listed in paragraph .B below. At least 90 days
prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that
become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the Pretreatment
Coordinator a report which contains the information listed in paragraph .B
below. A new source shall also be required to report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A
new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants discharged.



      B.   Users described above shall submit the information set
forth below:



         (1)   Identifying Information. The name and address of

control permits held by or for the facility.



         (3)   Description of Operations. A brief description of
the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial
classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points
of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.



         (4)   Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from
regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of
the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).



         (5)   Measurement of Pollutants.



            (a)   The categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process.



            (b)   The results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the
standard or by the Pretreatment Coordinator) of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long
term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in
accordance with procedures set out in subsection .10 of this Section.



            (c)   Sampling must be performed in accordance
with procedures set out in subsection .11 of this Section.



         (6)   Certification. A statement, reviewed the user’s
authorized representa tive and certified by a qualified professional,
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent
basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
additional pretreatment, is required to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.



         (7)   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment
and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set
out in subsection .2 of this Section.



         (8)   Signature and Certification. All baseline
monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
18-305.6 of this Part.



   2.   Compliance Schedule Progress Report. The following conditions
shall apply to the schedule required by subsection .1.B(7) of this Section:
(A) the schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited
to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing
contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction,
beginning and conducting routine operation); (B) no increment referred to
above shall exceed 9 months; (C) the user shall submit a progress report to
the Pretreatment Coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule; and (D) in no event shall more than 9 months elapse
between such progress reports to the Pretreatment Coordinator.



   3.   Report on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Pretreatment Coordinator a report containing the information described in
subsection .1.B(4)–(6) of this Section. For users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in
40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with § 18-305.6 of this Part.



   4.   Periodic Compliance Reports.



      A.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency
determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator but in no case less than twice per
year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 18-305.6 of this Part.



      B.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the
user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.



      C.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this
Section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
Pretreatment Coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in subsection .11
of this Part, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.



   5.   Report of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator of any planned significant changes to the user’s
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its
wastewater at least 30 days before the change.



      A.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require the user to
submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 18-305.6 of this Part.



      B.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may issue a wastewater
discharge permit under § 18-305.7 of this ordinance or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under § 18-306.4 of this Part in response to
changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.



      C.   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes
include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 10 percent or greater, the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, and changes affecting the
potential to cause a slug discharge.



   6.   Reports of Potential Problems.



      A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited
to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known)
and corrective actions taken by the user.



      B.   Within 5 days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Pretreatment Coordinator, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this Part.



      C.   Failure to notify the Pretreatment Coordinator of
potential problem discharges shall be deemed a violation of this Part.



      D.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in
the event of a discharge described in paragraph .A above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.



   7.   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Pretreatment Coordinator as the Pretreatment Coordinator may require.



   8.   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results
of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
Pretreatment Coordinator monitors at the user’s facility at least once a
month, or if the Pretreatment Coordinator samples between the user’s
initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.



   9.   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. The discharge
of hazardous waste into the sewer system is prohibited.



   10.   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.



   11.   Sample Collection.



      A.   Except as indicated in paragraph .B below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling
or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.



      B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.



   12.   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted
on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United State Postal Service, the date of
receipt of the report shall govern.



   13.   Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of
this Part shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this ordinance and any additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements, including records associated with BMPs. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the date’s analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period
of at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Borough, or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 7)



§ 18-308.   Compliance Monitoring.



   1.   Right of Entry; Inspection and Sampling. The Pretreatment
Coordinator shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Part,
and any permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Pretreatment
Coordinator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.



      A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the Pretreatment Coordinator will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.



      B.   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall have the right to set
up on the user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.



      C.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require the user to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated quarterly to ensure
their accuracy and certificates of calibration shall be sent to the
Pretreatment Coordinator.



      D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Pretreatment
Coordinator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the user.



      E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Pretreatment
Coordinator access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this Part.



   2.   Search Warrants. If the Pretreatment Coordinator has been
refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and
is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Borough designed
to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the Pretreatment Coordinator may seek issuance of a search
and/or seizure warrant from the Lebanon County Court.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 8)



§ 18-309.   Confidential Information.



   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Pretreatment Coordinator’s inspection and
sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 9)



§ 18-310.   Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.



   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall publish annually, in the largest
daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a
list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The
term “significant noncompli ance” shall mean:



      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements
taken during a 6-month period exceed the daily maximum limit, average limit,
or instantaneous limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount.



      B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here
as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a 6-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the daily maximum limit, the average limit, or the instantaneous
limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).



      C.   Any other discharge violation that the Pretreatment
Coordinator believe has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public).



      D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
Pretreatment Coordinator’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or
prevent such a discharge.



      E.   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance.



      F   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic
self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.



      G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.



      H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of
BMPs, which the Pretreatment Coordinator determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 10)



§ 18-311.   Administrative Enforcement Remedies.



   1.   Notification of Violation. When the Pretreatment Coordinator
finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of
this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 7 days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Pretreatment
Coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.



   2.   Consent Orders. The Pretreatment Coordinator may enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections .4 and .5 of this
Section and shall be judicially enforceable.



   3.   Show Cause Hearing. The Pretreatment Coordinator may order a
user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Pretreatment
Coordinator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action,
and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days
prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



   4.   Compliance Orders. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that
a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user
come into compliance within 15 days. If the user does not come into
compliance within 30 days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a Federal pretreat ment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.



   5.   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Pretreatment Coordinator
finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of
this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past
violations are likely to recur, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:



      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements.



      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



   6.   Administrative Fines.



      A.   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may fine such user in
an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.



      B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 15
calendar days, be assessed on additional penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1 percent per
month. A lien against the user’s property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties. The Pretreatment Coordinator may bring an
action in equity before the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County,
Pennsylvania to require compliance and to recover any amounts due.



      C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Pretreatment Coordinator to reconsider the fine along with
full payment of the fine amount within 10 days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the Pretreatment Coordinator may convene a hearing
on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.
The Pretreatment Coordinator may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



      D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. In
any action, the Borough may recover court costs and attorney’s fees.



   7.   Emergency Suspensions. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
immediately suspend a user’s discharge (after informal notice to the user)
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge
(after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with
the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment
to the environment.



      A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when
the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in subsection .8 of this Section are initiated against the user.



      B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections .3 and
.8 of this Section.



   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this Section.



   8.   Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in §
18-305.6 of this Part, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:



      A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.



      B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteris tics of its discharge.



      C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.



      D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.



      E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 18-302 of
this Part.



   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection .3 of this
Section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the Pretreatment Coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 11)



§ 18-312.   Judicial Enforcement Remedies.



   1.   Injunctive Relief. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that
a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
petition the Lebanon County Court through the Borough’s Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Part on activities of the
user. The Pretreatment Coordinator may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user. In such proceedings, the Borough may collect its
attorney’s fees and costs.



   2.   Civil Penalties.



      A.   An industrial user who willfully or negligently violates
any pretreatment standards and/or requirements may be assessed a civil
penalty by the Pretreatment Coordinator in an amount not to exceed $25,000
per day for each violation, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Each
violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense under this Section.



      B.   For purposes of this Section, a single operational upset
which leads to simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard
or requirement shall be treated as a single violation as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act.



      C.   In addition to the civil penalty, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may recover the costs for reestablishing the operation of the
POTW.



      D.   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall include as part of the
notice of an assessment of civil penalties a description of the appeals
process to be followed, including the name, address, and telephone number of
the person responsible for accepting such appeal.



      E.   The Borough Council shall publicly adopt a formal,
written civil penalty assessment policy and make it publicly available. Each
industrial discharger participating in the pretreatment program shall be
given written notice of the policy. In developing the penalty assessment
policy, the publicly owned treatment works shall consider damage to air,
water, land, or other natural resources of this Commonwealth and their uses;
cost of restoration and abatement; savings resulting to the person in
consequence of the violation; history of past violations; deterrence of
future violations; and other relevant factors.



      F.   Civil penalties collected pursuant to this act shall be
placed in a restricted account and shall only be used by the publicly owned
treatment works for the repair of damage and any additional maintenance
needed or any additional costs imposed as a result of the violation for which
the penalty was imposed, to pay any penalties imposed on the publicly owned
treatment works by the Federal or State government for violation of
pretreatment standards, for the costs incurred by the publicly owned
treatment works to investigate and take the enforcement action that resulted
in a penalty being imposed, for the monitoring of discharges in the
pretreatment program and for capital improvements to the treatment works,
including sewage collection lines, which may be required by the pretreatment
program. Any remaining funds may be used for capital improvements to the
treatment works, including collection lines.



      G.   The industrial user charged with the penalty shall have
30 days to pay the proposed penalty in full, or, if the industrial user
wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the
violation, the industrial user must file an appeal within 30 days pursuant to
2 Pa.C.S. (relating to administrative law and procedure). Failure to appeal
within this period shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest
the violation or the amount of the penalty. In the event of an appeal, the
Borough Council shall conduct a hearing and decide the appeal as provided by
administrative law and procedure. In the event, after hearing and decision,
the industrial user wishes to make a further appeal, it may do so by filing
an appropriate appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County within
30 days of the final order of Borough Council.



   3.   Criminal Prosecution.



      A.   A user who violates any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction thereof in an
action brought before a magiste rial district judge in the manner provided
for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus
costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part
continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have been
violated shall constitute a separate offense. [Ord. 818]



      B.   A user who introduces any substance into the POTW which
causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction thereof in
an action brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided
for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus
costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part
continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have been
violated shall constitute a separate offense. This fine shall be in addition
to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available
under State law. [Ord. 818]



      C.   A user who knowingly made any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan,
or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
ordinance, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who
falsified, tampered with, or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this Part shall, upon conviction thereof in
an action brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided
for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus
costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part
continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have been
violated shall constitute a separate offense. [Ord. 818]



   4.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part
are not exclusive. The Pretreatment Coordinator may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Borough’s
enforcement response plan. However, the Pretreatment Coordinator may take
other action against any user when the circum stances warrant. Further, the
Pretreatment Coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 12; as amended by Ord. 818, 12/10/2013)



§ 18-313.   Supplemental Enforcement Action.



   1.   Performance Bonds. The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline to
issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the
Borough, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Pretreatment
Coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.



   2.   Liability Insurance. The Pretreatment Coordinator may decline
to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed
to comply with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW
caused by its discharge.



   3.   Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only
recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated
its ability to comply.



   4.   Informant Rewards. The Pretreatment Coordinator may pay up to
$100 for information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. In
the event that the information provided results in an administrative fine or
civil penalty levied against the user, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
disperse up to 10 percent of the collected fine or penalty to the informant.
However, a single reward payment may not exceed $100.



   5.   Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the Borough.
Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the Borough held by a
user found to be in significant noncompli ance with pretreatment standards or
requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the Pretreatment
Coordinator.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 13)



§ 18-314.   Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.



   1.   Upset.



      A.   For the purposes of this Section, “upset” means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



      B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if
the requirements of paragraph .C are met.



      C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
lots, or other relevant evidence that:



         (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset.



         (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures.



         (3)   The user has submitted the following information
to the Pretreatment Coordinator and treatment plant operator within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within 5 days):



            (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompli ance.



            (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact
dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance
is expected to continue.



            (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



      F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



   2.   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 18-302.1.A of this Part or
the specific prohibitions in § 18-302.1.B(3) of this Part if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either: (A) a local limit exists for each pollutant
discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to,
and during, the pass through or interference; or (B) no local limit exists,
but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from
the user’s prior discharge when the Borough was regularly in compliance
with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance
with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.



   3.   Bypass.



      A.   For the purposes of this Section:



         (1)   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of
waste streams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.



         (2)   “Severe property damage” means substantial
physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to be inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



      B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of paragraphs .C and .D of this Section.



      C.   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator, at
least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.



         (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the
Pretreatment Coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time
the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned
to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.



      D.   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Pretreatment
Coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass,
unless:



            (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage.



            (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance.



            (c)   The user submitted notices as required under
paragraph .C of this Section.



         (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator, after consulting
with the Superinten dent and/or the Borough Manager and/or the Consulting
Engineer, may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse
effects, if they determine that it will meet the three conditions listed in
subparagraph (1) of this Section.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 14)



§ 18-315.   Miscellaneous Provisions.



   1.   Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The Borough may adopt reasonable
fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Borough’s
Pretreatment Program which may include:



      A.   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications
including the cost of processing such applications.



      B.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance
procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user’s
discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users.



      C.   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction.



      D.   Fees for filing appeals.



      E.   Other fees as the Borough may deem necessary to carry out
the require ments contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered by this Part and are separate from all other fees, fines, and
penalties chargeable by the Borough. All fees may be updated by resolution of
Borough Council.



   2.   Severability. If any provision of this Part is invalidated by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be
affected and shall continue in full force and effect.



   3.   Conflicts. All other ordinances and parts of other ordinances
inconsistent or conflicting with any part of this Part are hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency or conflict.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 15)



§ 18-316.   Determination of Charges for Strong Wastes.



   1.   Strong Waste Surcharges. There shall be additional charges for
wastes having concentrations of BOD, suspended solids, dissolved solids, and
phosphorus in excess of the average concentration of these pollutants in
normal domestic waste. Normal domestic waste shall be considered has having
the following concentrations:



      A.   BOD–300 mg/L.



      B.   Suspended solids–250 mg/L.



      C.   Dissolved solids–500 mg/L.



      D.   Phosphorus–6.6 mg/L.



      E.   Ammonia Nitrogen–25 mg/L.



   Maximum acceptable wastewater strength concentrations are as follows:



      A.   BOD–900 mg/L.



      B.   Suspended solids–750 mg/L.



      C.   Dissolved solids–1,500 mg/L.



      D.   Phosphorus–19.8 mg/L.



      E.   Ammonia Nitrogen–75 mg/L.



   2.   Strong Waste Surcharge Formula. In order to determine the
additional charges for wastes with strength greater than that of domestic
waste, the following formula shall be used:







   Where:



      A.   SQ is the quarterly surcharge to be added to the normal
sewer rent.



      B.   0.00834 is a constant to convert waste concentrations
expressed in mg/L to thousands of pounds of waste.



      C.   QI is the quarterly waste flow expressed in million
gallons.



      D.   BODI, SS1, DSI, PI, and NH3NI, are the respective
concentrations of BOD5, suspended solids, dissolved solids, phosphorus, and
ammonia nitrogen of the waste expressed in mg/L.



      E.   300, 250, 500, 6.6, and 25 are constants which express
the waste load concentrations in mg/L for normal domestic wastes.



      F.   TCBOD is the treatment cost incurred by the Borough as
updated annually per 1,000 pounds of BOD.



      G.   TCSS is the treatment cost incurred by the Borough as
updated annually per 1,000 pounds of suspended solids.



      H.   TCDS is the treatment cost incurred by the Borough as
updated annually per 1,000 pounds of dissolved solids.



      I.   TCP is the treatment cost incurred by the Borough as
updated annually per 1,000 pounds of phosphorus.



      J.   TCNH3N is the treatment cost incurred by the Borough as
updated annually per 1,000 pounds of ammonia nitrogen.



   When a value of BOD, suspended solids, dissolved solids, phosphorus,
and/or ammonia nitrogen is less than the normal domestic waste concentration
set forth in the strong waste surcharge formula, then the normal domestic
waste concentration shall be used in the calculation of strong waste
surcharge.



   3.   Additional Surcharges. The formula specified in subsection .2
of this Section is to determine additional charges or surcharges for the
treatment of wastes having concentrations of BOD, suspended solids, dissolved
solids, phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen in excess of those of domestic
waste. It is, however, recognized that the discharge of any waste or other
matter or substance containing any one of the prohibited substances listed in
§ 18-302.1 may result in extraordinary laboratory, labor, maintenance and/or
treatment expenses to the Borough. Hence, in the event of the discharge of
any wastes or other matters or substance containing any one of the prohibited
substances listed in § 18-302.1 or § 18-302.4 multiplied by the TRC, the
Borough shall have the power to bill the owner of the property from which
such discharge is made an additional surcharge of $300. Each day that such
discharge is made shall result in a separate $300 additional surcharge. This
$300 charge shall be in addition to the normal sewer rental and/or any strong
waste surcharge as incurred under subsection .2 of this Section.



   4.   Methods of Payment of Extra Charges by Industrial Users. The
strong waste surcharge shall be paid quarterly. The Borough shall cause the
water meter of each industrial user where the wastewater flow determination
is based upon metered water consumption, and the wastewater meter where the
wastewater flow determination is based upon wastewater flow measurement, to
be read on a quarterly basis and the Borough shall cause strong waste
surcharge bills to be mailed forthwith following each reading.



      A.   The Borough shall cause periodic sampling of the
wastewater discharged by each industrial user in accordance with § 18-317.1
of this Part.



      B.   The analysis of the sample shall be the basis for
computing strong waste surcharges.



      C.   Bills for strong waste surcharge shall be mailed to the
owner’s address specified on the industrial waste permit. Failure to
receive a bill as a result of incorrect address or otherwise shall not excuse
nonpayment of charges or extend the time for payment.



   5.   New Industrial Users. A new industrial user is one which
connects to the treatment works after the effective date of this Section.
Strong waste surcharge payments by a new industrial user shall begin on the
date treatment works use is initiated and continue indefinitely.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 16)



§ 18-317.   Measurement of Concentration of Industrial Waste.



   1.   Industrial Waste Sampling. Industrial wastes being discharged
into the sewer system shall be subject to sampling and inspection to be used
as a basis for determining additional charges due to excessive concentrations
of BOD, suspended solids, dissolved solids, phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen,
and/or substances prohibited in § 18-302.1 of this Part. Such sampling and
inspection shall be made by the Borough as frequently as may be deemed
necessary. The analysis of the sample so obtained shall be the basis for
computing additional charges in accordance with § 18-316.4 of this Part. The
cost of such sampling and testing thereof shall be borne by the user.



   The industry may request that samples be taken in addition to the
samples taken by the Borough. The cost of making this collection and analysis
shall be borne by the owner.



   Samples and the analysis of samples shall be made in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in
an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by EPA.



   2.   Control Manhole. When required by the Borough, the owner of any
property discharging industrial waste into the sewer system shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the waste. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Borough. The manhole shall be installed by the property owner, at his
expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at
all times.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 17)



§ 18-318.   Measurement of Volume of Industrial Wastes.



   1.   Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a
water purveyor discharges only industrial waste into the sewer system, the
volume of water purchased may be used as a measure of the quantity of
industrial waste discharged.



   2.   Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a
water purveyor discharges combined domestic waste and industrial waste into
the sewer system, the volume of water purchased chargeable as industrial
waste shall be the total volume of water purchased less the volume determined
to be domestic waste. The domestic waste shall be determined by the Borough
in either of the following two ways:



      A.   Actual measured flow.



      B.   By multiplying the average number of employees in the
establishment during the preceding billing period by 10 gallons per day.



   3.   Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a
water purveyor and discharging industrial waste into the sewer system also
discharges unpolluted cooling water to either a separate storm sewer or other
outlet, an allowance for the amount of water so discharged shall be made in
computing the sewer charges. The person so discharging cooling water shall,
at his own expense, install a meter or meters, as required, to indicate
accurately and to the satisfaction of the Borough the amount of water claimed
as a credit.



   4.   The Borough shall be responsible for the reading of water
and/or sewage meters when installed in industrial establishments within its
jurisdiction. All meters shall be installed at a location approved by the
Borough. All meters shall be accessible to the Borough at all times.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 18)



§ 18-319.   Access.



   The Borough shall have the right of access to any part of any improved
property served by the POTW as shall be required for purposes of inspection,
measurement, sampling and testing, and for performance of other functions
relating to service rendered by the Borough through the POTW.



(Ord. 799, 3/9/2010, § 19)



§ 18-320.   Effective Date.



   This Part shall be in full force and effect immediately following its
passage, approval and publication, as provided by law.

Part 3
Specifications Relating to the Street System and Street Improvements



§ 21-301.   Street System and Street Improvements.



   1.   In addition to relating to topography, natural features, solar
orientation and the Borough Street Map (or Comprehensive Plan), streets shall
be designed according to the function served, the use of abutting land, and
the standards of width, intersec tions, maximum grades and curvatures. The
Borough Council shall require that all developments have adequate access.
Where major subdivision is proposed or may occur because of the patterns
started by minor subdivision activity, the Borough Council should require
reservation for, or installation of, two or more streets to insure safe and
convenient access.



   2.   Elimination or vacation of previously approved streets shall be
approved only when the Borough Council determines that (A) alternate access
has been provided in another, more suitable location, (B) further development
is not possible utilizing the street, and (C) any land owners who purchase
property with reliance upon the street agree in writing to its elimination.



   3.   The developer shall design and construct streets, including
pavements, shoulders, gutters, curbs, etc., as required by Borough ordinance.
The Borough reserves the right from time to time to amend the requirement by
the adoption of a new resolution. Where specific municipal regulations do not
exist, the following require ments shall apply:



      A.   Classification and General Design Goals.



         (1)   Major Streets. Function primarily for the movement
of higher speed traffic between points of heavy traffic generation. They are
often known as arterial streets or highways. They shall be planned for
continuation of existing streets in the system at the same or greater width
in accordance with adopted municipal standards. Major streets shall contain
as few intersections as possible.



         (2)   Collector Streets. Function to collect traffic
from local streets and distribute it into major streets, and, as such, they
will normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with local
streets and few with major streets. Collector streets shall be planned for
continuity and to lead more or less directly to one or more focal points or
centers of traffic generation, and may become bus routes.



         (3)   Local Streets. Provide direct access to each lot
and function to allow traffic to circulate toward the principal directions of
travel, bus routes, schools and playgrounds; however, the design shall
discourage through and high speed traffic. The street pattern shall be
indirect and yet continuous to hinder through traffic, formed of straight,
moderately winding, curved, looped or angular streets. Tee-intersections
shall predominate and cross-intersections shall be minimized. There shall be
an underlying systematic neighborhood pattern; however, gridiron and other
rigid geometrical patterns should be avoided where possible. The street
pattern shall include extensions to the boundaries of the development to
provide circulation between adjoining neighborhoods.



         (4)   Cul-de-sac Streets. Provide direct access to
properties from other streets. Ordinarily, a cul-de-sac is a short street
with only one outlet and having an appropriate terminal for safe and
convenient reversal of traffic movement.



         (5)   Alleys. Provide secondary means of access to
properties. Alleys are useful in dense residential areas to provide access to
the rear of the properties or in commercial and industrial areas to provide
access to parking or loading areas.



      B.   Minimum Street Standards. See chart at end of this Part.



      C.   Supplementary Street Standards. In addition to the
specific standards cited in paragraph .B, the following street standards
shall apply to design and construction of streets:



         (1)   Intersections.



            (a)   Streets shall be designed to intersect at
right angles (90 degrees) and should be at right angles for at least 100 feet
from the intersection of the centerlines.



            (b)   No more than two streets shall intersect at
any one point.



            (c)   Proposed new intersections on one side of a
street shall coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of
the street. Where intersections cannot practically be connected, a minimum of
150 feet shall separate the centerlines of offset local streets, and a
minimum of 400 feet shall separate the centerlines of offset collector and
major streets.



            (d)   Proposed new intersections on one side of a
street shall be separated by at least 150 feet from existing or proposed
streets on the same side of the street.



            (e)   Street curb intersections shall be rounded
with a minimum radius of 25 feet for local streets and 35 feet for collector
and major streets. The radius point shall be concentric with that for the
right-of-way line.



            (f)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat
grade. In hilly or rolling topography, a leveling area shall be provided at
the approach to an intersection. The leveling area shall have a maximum grade
of 4 percent for 60 feet preceding the intersection, measured from the
nearest right-of- way line of the intersecting street.



            (g)   Clear sight triangles of 75 feet measured
along the centerline from the point of intersection shall be provided and
maintained at all intersections. No obstruction to the vision of a motorist
shall be permitted within the clear sight triangle.



            (h)   Intersection sight distance shall be
provided in accordance with the Sight Distance Table at the end of this Part.
If adequate sight distance is not available the Borough may: require removal
of an obstruction at the applicant’s expense, require alteration of the
street or access way, may restrict some movements at the intersection, or may
deny access at this location.



            (i)   Intersections with State highways shall be
subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.



         (2)   Street Names. Shall not duplicate others nearby,
and shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Council. Streets that are
extensions or in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the
existing street.



         (3)   Street Signs. Shall be erected to identify all
streets, which shall conform to specifications approved by the Borough
Council and installed by the developer in a manner and time specified by the
Borough. Regulatory signs shall be installed at locations identified in the
plans prepared by the developer. Standard traffic signs shall be approved and
shall be supplied and installed in accordance with Borough regulations,
PennDOT Publication 68-Official Traffic Devices, and the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) by the Federal Highway Administration.



         (4)   Street Alignment. Horizontal curves shall be used
at all horizontal alignment deflections in excess of 2 degrees. The minimum
horizontal radii are listed in the Minimum Street Standards Table in
subsection .1.B of this Part.



   Vertical curves shall be used at all vertical alignment deflections in
excess of 1 percent. The minimum length of vertical curves shall be the K
value times the change in grade (in percent). The length of vertical curves
may need to be increased to provide adequate nighttime sight distance if
streetlights are not provided. Combinations of minimum horizontal radius and
minimum vertical curve lengths should be closely evaluated for adequate sight
distance and should be avoided where possible.



         (5)   Street Extension. Where a subdivision adjoins
unsubdivided land, sufficient streets shall be planned to extend to the
boundary lines so that all parcels may be subdivided and a coordinated street
system obtained.



         (6)   Reverse Frontage Lots. May be required where a
development abuts an existing or proposed arterial or collector street in
order to protect the abutting properties, reduce the number of intersections
and separate the local and through traffic.



         (7)   Streets for Multi-family Development. Shall be
planned to connect with major or collector streets to avoid generating large
volumes of traffic on local residential streets.



         (8)   Reserve Strips. The creation of reserve strips
shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to
deny access from adjacent property to such street.



         (9)   Right-of-Way Widths. Land for the right-of-way for
the opening or extension of any street within a subdivision shall be
dedicated by the developer with all costs paid by the developer. Where a
property abuts a street, which does not conform to the right-of-way width
required by this Part or other resolutions of the Borough, the additional
width necessary to meet current standards shall be dedicated when such land

Storm Sewer Regulations



§ 23-101.   Purpose and Legislative Findings.



   The purposes of this Part are to promote the general health, welfare,
and safety of the citizens of Myerstown Borough by preserving and protecting
the waters of the Borough and adjacent municipalities through the
implementation of methods that will prevent and make illegal illicit
discharges to this municipal separate stormwater system of the Borough. These
methods are further made necessary by the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Protection NPDES Phase II regulations and stormwater discharge
permit. The objectives of this Part are:



      A.   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS 4) by stormwater discharges by any
user.



      B.   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the
municipal separate storm sewer system.



      C.   To establish the legal authority to carry out all
inspection, surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this Part.



(Ord. 788, 7/12/2005, §I)



§ 23-102.   Prohibition Against Non-stormwater Discharges.



   1.   Prohibited Discharges.



      A.   No person in the Borough shall allow, or cause to allow,
discharges into the Borough’s separate storm sewer system which are not
composed entirely of stormwater, except as provided in the paragraph .B
below; and, discharges approved under a State or Federal permit.



      B.   Discharges which may be allowed based on a finding by the
Borough that the discharge(s) do not significantly contribute to pollution to
surface waters of the Commonwealth are:



         (1)   Discharges from firefighting activities.



         (2)   Discharges from potable water sources not
containing chlorine, including dechlorinated water line and fire hydrant
flushing.



         (3)   Irrigation drainage.



         (4)   Discharges from routine external building wash
down (which does not use detergents or other compounds).



         (5)   Discharges from air conditioning condensate.



         (6)   Discharges from water from individual residential
car washing.



         (7)   Springs.



         (8)   Discharges from water from crawl space pumps.



         (9)   Discharges from uncontaminated water from
foundation or from footing drains.



         (10)   Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.



         (11)   Discharges from lawn watering.



         (12)   Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of
toxic or hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill material has
been removed) and where detergents are not used.



         (13)   Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.



         (14)   Discharges from uncontaminated groundwater.



         (15)   Dye testing, but verbal notification must be
provided to the Borough Manager prior to the time of the test.



      C.   In the event that the Borough determines that any of the
discharges identified in paragraph .B significantly contribute to pollution
of waters of the Commonwealth, or is so notified by DEP, the Borough will
notify the responsible person to cease the discharge.



      D.   Upon notice provided by the Borough under paragraph .C,
the discharger will have a reasonable time, as determined by the Borough, to
cease the discharge consistent with the degree of pollution caused by the
discharge.



      E.   Nothing in this Section shall affect a discharger’s
responsibilities under State law.



   2.   Prohibited Connections. The following connections are
prohibited, except as provided in subsection .1.B above:



      A.   Any drain of conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows any non-stormwater discharge including sewage,
process wastewater, and wash water, to enter the separate storm sewer system,
and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks.



      B.   Roof Drains.



         (1)   Roof drains shall not be connected to streets,
sanitary or storm sewers, or roadside ditches, except as provided in
subsection .2.



         (2)   When it is more advantageous to connect directly
to streets or storm sewers, connections of roof drains to streets or roadside
ditches may be permitted on a case by case basis by the Borough.



         (3)   Roof drains shall discharge to infiltration areas
or vegetative BMPs to the maximum extent practicable.



      C.   Waste Disposal Prohibitions. No person shall throw,
deposit, leave, maintain, keep, or permit to be thrown, deposited, left, or
maintained, in or upon any public or private property, driveway, parking
area, street, alley, sidewalk, or other component of the Borough’s separate
storm sewer system, any refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded
or abandoned objects, articles, and accumulations, so that the same may cause
or contribute to pollution. Wastes deposited in streets in proper waste
receptacles for the purposes of collection are exempted from this prohibition.



      D.   Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the separate storm sewer system which has not been
documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records, and approved by the Borough.



      E.   These prohibitions apply to both existing and future
connections.

§ 23-103.   Suspension of Discharge.



   The Borough may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to

discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons. Any person
discharging to the MS4, in violation of this Part, may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.
The violator may petition the Borough for a reconsideration and hearing.



(Ord. 788, 7/12/2005, § 403)



§ 23-104.   Maintaining Watercourse.



   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse.



(Ord. 788, 7/12/2005, § 404)



§ 23-105.   Action for Illegal Discharge or Pollutants.

response for a facility or operation has any information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in
illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into the stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such a release. In
the event of a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of the release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the Borough in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the
next business day. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least 3 years.



(Ord. 788, 7/12/2005, § 405)



§ 23-106.   Applicability of Ordinance.

   Any person aggrieved by the Borough’s decision to suspend their MS4
discharge access may petition the Borough Council of the Borough to
reconsider its determination. The Petition shall be filed within 30 days of
the Borough decision. Such an appeal shall be heard by the Borough Council of
the Borough within 30 days of the filing of the Petition. The Borough Council
shall render a decision within 30 days of the hearing. In these proceedings,
the following shall apply:



      A.   Failure to submit a timely petition and to pay the appeal
fee as established by the Borough shall be deemed to be a waiver of the

      B.   In the petition, the appealing party must indicate the
provisions objected to, and the reasons for the objection.



      C.   The effectiveness of the Borough’s determination shall

      E.   A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual
consideration of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held
by cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value

were previously husband and wife who have since been divorced; provided, the
property or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the

Part as if such transfer were made directly from the settlor to the grantee.

occupation within the Myerstown Borough during the tax year. Each individual
who exercises such privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall

in accordance with the provisions of this Part. This tax may be used solely
for the following purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough
Council of Myerstown Borough from time to time: (1) emergency services, which
shall include emergency medical services, police services, and/or fire
services; (2) road construction and/or maintenance; (3) reduction of property
taxes; or (4) property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and

services. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature
heretofore levied by Myerstown Borough. The tax shall be no more than $52 on
each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which an individual may be employed.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 3)



§ 24-404.   Exceptions and Refunds.



   1.   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits
from all sources within Myerstown Borough is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the local services tax is levied is exempt from the
payment of the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons
are exempt from payment of the tax:



      A.   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in
which the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released
under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic, or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service- connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100 percent disability.



      B.   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component
of the armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “reserve component of
the armed forces” shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States
Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard
Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National
Guard, or the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.



   2.   Procedure to Claim Exemption.



      A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local
services tax may annually file an exemption certificate with Myerstown
Borough and with the person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources within
Myerstown Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. In the event Myerstown Borough utilizes a tax
collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to
that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within
Myerstown Borough for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the local services tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
collector of the local services tax for Myerstown Borough or except as
required by paragraph .B, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times
and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by Myerstown
Borough.



      B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a
given calendar year from the local services tax, upon notification to an
employer by the person or by Myerstown Borough that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within Myerstown Borough equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an
employer's payment to the person of earned income within Myerstown Borough in
an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer
shall withhold the local services tax from the person under paragraph .C.



      C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar
year under paragraph .B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
paragraph .B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld
from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person under this
subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period.
The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of
the local services tax under this paragraph is subsequently severed in that
calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax
due, and Myerstown Borough may pursue collection under this Part.



      D.   Except as provided in paragraph .B, it is the intent of
this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.



      E.   Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of
all exemption certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year
for a minimum of 3 years.



      F.   Employers who have failed to withhold the local services
tax from an employee or employees, and do not have copies of the employee
exemption certificate or certificates, will be held responsible for the
payment of the local services tax as if the tax had been originally levied
against the employer.



   3.   Refunds. The Borough of Myerstown, in consultation with the
collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal law
relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the
employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar
year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall
be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough of Myerstown or the collector shall determine eligibility for
exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 4)



§ 24-405.   Duty of Employer to Collect Tax.



   1.   Each employer within Myerstown Borough, as well as those
employers situated outside Myerstown Borough but who engage in business
within Myerstown Borough, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the
tax from each of the employees engaged by the employer or performing work for
the employer within Myerstown Borough and making a return and payment thereof
to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this
tax for each employee who is employed by the employer, whether said employee
is paid by salary, wage, or commission and whether or not all such services
are performed within Myerstown Borough.



   2.   Each person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the
employer a pro rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the
person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed
on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the
“combined rate” of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax for an employee shall be made on a payroll
period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation, beginning with the first payroll period in which the person is
engaging in the occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of this
Section. For purposes of this subsection, “combined rate” shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the
municipality.



   3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services
tax by more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.



   4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain
from withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from
a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of
the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from
the employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal
employer and the employee will notify other employers of a change in
principal place of employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence. The
employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.



   5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer with a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.



   6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the
local services tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to Myerstown
Borough if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information
submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment,
the employee’s principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local
services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if
the employee complies with the provisions of § 24-404.2 of this Part and
this Section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this Part.



   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes
30 days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 5)



§ 24-406.   Returns.



   1.   Employers and self-employed individuals are required to make
and file a local services tax quarterly return 30 days after the end of each
quarter of a calendar year. The local services tax quarterly return shall
list the name, address, Social Security number of the employee; the physical
address of the employee’s place of employment; the number of payroll
periods for which the local services tax was withheld and the amount of local
services tax being remitted for each employee.



   2.   If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax,
whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages,
or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided
hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of
the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied against the
employer.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 6)



§ 24-407.   Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.



   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records
to determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and
paid over to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 7)



§ 24-408.   Self-Employed Individuals and Employers.



   All self-employed individuals and individuals whose employer is not
required to withhold the local services tax (certain State and Federal
agencies) who performs services of any type or kind or engages in any
occupation or profession with a primary place of employment within the
political subdivision shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the
pro rata portion of the tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth
day following the end of each quarter.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 8)



§ 24-409.   Individuals Engaged in More than One Occupation or Employed
in More than One Political Subdivision.



   1.   The situs of the local services tax shall be the place of
employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax during each
payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation,
that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the
priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following
order when each of the municipalities imposes a local services tax:



      A.   First, the political subdivision in which a person
maintains his or her principal office or is principally employed.



      B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person
resides and works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.



      C.   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is
employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.



   2.   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for
that calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment
constitutes prima facie certifica tion of payment to all other political
subdivisions. The final determination of priority payment shall be made under
the provisions of this Part and the provisions of the law.



   3.   In the event that a person is engaged in an occupation which
requires the person working in more than one political subdivision during the
payroll period, in a case where only one of the political subdivisions
imposes the local services tax, the priority of the claim to collect the tax
shall be in the following order:



      A.   If the political subdivisions have entered into an
agreement that provides for payment to a specific political subdivision, that
political subdivision shall receive payment of the tax.



      B.   If only one of the political subdivisions imposes the
local services tax, the payment shall be made to that municipality.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 9)



§ 24-410.   Nonresidents Subject to Tax.



   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their
places of business outside of Myerstown Borough but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within Myerstown
Borough do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to
the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with
the same force and effect as though they were residents of Myerstown Borough.
Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within Myerstown Borough and
an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this Part,
be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her local
services tax is not paid, Myerstown Borough shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.



(Ord. 794, 12/11/2007, § 10)



§ 24-411.   Administration of Tax.



   1.   Any subsequent collector shall be appointed by resolution of
the Borough Council of Myerstown Borough. It shall be the duty of the

thereof showing the amount received by the collector from each employer or
self-employed person, together with the date the tax was received. It shall
be the duty of the collector to accept and keep a record of the information
submitted by employers relating to the number of employees exempt from the
tax, the employee exemption certificates and refunds of the tax paid to
individuals and employers.



   2.   The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt, and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of
this Part, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this Part, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this Part and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of
1998, 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 842.1 et seq.



   3.   The collector and Myerstown Borough are hereby authorized to
examine the books and payroll records of any employer in order to verify the
accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give
the collector and Myerstown Borough the means, facilities, and opportunity
for such examination.

rate of 6 percent on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning
with the due date of the tax and a penalty of 10 percent shall be added to
the flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for
the recovery of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the
individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for
the costs of collection including, but not limited to, administrative
expenses and attorney’s fees.

in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return or to pay the tax required by this Section, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by

must report any change of information contained in the registration within 10
days of the change. Change of information shall be reported in writing to the
Borough Manager or his designee.



   H.   Pursuant to any determination that any property is in violation
of this section, the Borough may take the necessary action to ensure
compliance with this ordinance, and may place a lien on the property for the
cost of the work performed to benefit the property and bring it into
compliance.



(Ord. 837, 9/13/2016, §4)

   C.   If a Lender is unable or unwilling to perform maintenance and
inspections itself, the Lender shall contract with a property management
company to perform the work necessary to bring the property into compliance
with Borough Ordinances, and the property manager must perform regular
inspections, at intervals to be determined by the Borough, to verify
compliance with the requirements of this section and any other applicable
laws. Upon request of the Borough, the Lender shall provide a copy of the
inspection reports to the Borough or its designee.



   D.   Failure of the Lender to properly maintain the property will

issuance of a citation. Pursuant to a finding and determination by the
Enforcement Officer or a court of competent jurisdiction, the Borough may
take the necessary action to ensure compliance with this Ordinance.

Using this Ordinance: an Overview



These two pages describe the most efficient way to use this Ordinance. These
pages are general descriptions but are not part of the actual Ordinance.



Start by using the following parts of the Zoning Ordinance:



•   Please contact the Zoning Officer to make sure you have the latest
version of the Zoning Ordinance Text and Map.



•   Turn to the Table of Contents and the Index (at the end of the
document) to find the pages and sections that apply to your particular
situation. You may wish to photocopy the Table of Contents to highlight the
relevant sections.



•   Review the Zoning Map at the end of this Zoning Ordinance or online
to determine the Zoning District that includes your lot.



•   Review Parts 3 or 4, the Table of Permitted Uses By Zoning District,
which indicates the uses permitted in each Zoning District. A use is
permitted in three ways:



      a)   by right,



      b)   by special exception (the Zoning Hearing Board must
approve the use, as described in Section 27-1416), or



      c)   as a conditional use (the Borough Council must approve
the use, as described in Section 27-1417).



•   Consult Part 5, including the Table of Lot and Setback Requirements
By Zoning District. This table states the required minimum size of each lot
and the required minimum distance that buildings must be from streets and
other lot lines in each Zoning District.



•   Refer to the Definitions in Part 15 to determine the meaning of
specific words.



If a lot is already being legally used for a particular purpose and that use
is not permitted in the Zoning District according to Parts 3 or 4, that use
is called a "Non-Conforming Use". In almost all cases, a lawful
Non-Conforming Use can continue, can expand within limits, can change to
another use within limits, and can be sold. See Section 27-1405 regarding
"Non-Conformities."



Certain specific uses must comply with additional regulations. The "principal
uses" (which are the primary use of a property) are listed in alphabetical
order in Section 27-602 and the "accessory uses" (which are secondary uses,
such as low-intensity businesses in a home) are listed in alphabetical order
in Section 27-603. For example, additional regulations are listed for sheds,
garages and other structures typically found on a residential lot under
"Residential Accessory Structures" in Section 27-603.



If your lot may be flood-prone, see the Floodplain regulations in Part 9 and
the Federal Floodplain Maps (which can be viewed at Borough Hall or at
www.fema.gov).



Turn to the following articles and sections for regulations concerning
parking, signs and buffer yards:



•   Many uses must provide minimum numbers of off-street Parking spaces
under Part 11 of this ordinance. The parking standards are listed in a table.



•   If Signs are proposed within public view, Part 12 must be met. This
article lists the types, heights and sizes of signs that are permitted.



•   Certain uses are required to provide an open Buffer Yard with
Screening to buffer nearby homes and adjacent residentially zoned land from
nuisances. See Section 27-1303.



The following additional considerations should be kept in mind when using
this Ordinance:



•   An applicant may apply to the Borough Zoning Hearing Board for a
Zoning Variance if he/she is not able to comply with a provision of this
Zoning Ordinance. An application fee is required to compensate the Borough
for legal advertisements and other costs. See Section 27-1311, which includes
the standards that must be met under State law in order to be granted a
variance. Generally, under the PA. Municipalities Planning Code, variances
are not permitted unless an applicant proves a legal "Hardship".



•   Generally, if one or more new lots will be created, or existing lot
lines will be altered, or one or more new principal non-residential buildings
are proposed, then the requirements and approval procedures of the County's
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO) will also apply.



•   For Stormwater Management, see the separate County ordinance.



•   If there will be disturbance of the ground, it will be necessary to
use certain measures to control soil erosion. In such case, contact the
County Conservation District.



Any questions concerning the Zoning Ordinance should be directed to the
Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer also administers applications for zoning
permits.



A separate Construction Official handles applications for building and other
construction permits.

Part 1
Title; Enactment; Severability



Ordinance No. 841



   1.   Title. A New Zoning Ordinance: a) dividing Myerstown, Lebanon
County, Pennsylvania into zoning districts with varying regulations; b)
permitting, prohibiting and regulating: the uses of land, watercourses and
other bodies of water, the size, height, bulk, location, erection,
construction, expansion, razing, removal and use of structures, the areas and
dimensions of land and water to be occupied by uses and structures, as well
as open areas to be left unoccupied; c) establishing the maximum density and
intensity of uses; d) providing for the administration and enforcement of
this Ordinance in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (MPC) as amended, including provisions for special exception uses and
variances to be administered by a Zoning Hearing Board; and e) establishing
provisions for the protection of certain natural features.



   2.   Short Title. This Ordinance shall be known and be cited as the
"Borough of Myerstown Zoning Ordinance" of 2017.



   3.   Severability. It is hereby declared to be the legislative
intent that if a court of competent jurisdiction declares any provisions of
this Ordinance to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, the effect
of such decision shall be limited to those provisions which are expressly
stated in the decision to be invalid or ineffective, and all other provisions
of this Ordinance shall continue to be separately and fully effective. The
Borough Council hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and
each section or part thereof, other than any part declared invalid, if it had
advance knowledge that any part would be declared invalid. If the entire
Zoning Ordinance should be declared invalid, then the Borough of Myerstown
Zoning Ordinance that was in effect immediately prior to the enactment of
this new Zoning Ordinance shall automatically be re-instated as the Zoning
Ordinance for the Borough of Myerstown.



   4.   Procedural Defects in Enactment. Allegations that this
Ordinance or any amendment was enacted in a procedurally defective manner
shall be appealed as provided in State law.



   5.   Repealer. The pre-existing Borough of Myerstown Zoning
Ordinance, as amended, is hereby repealed, in addition to the repeal of any
other Borough ordinances or resolutions or parts thereof that were adopted
prior to this Ordinance that are clearly in direct conflict with this
Ordinance.



   6.   Enactment. Under the authority conferred by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, the Borough Council of the Borough
of Myerstown hereby enacts and ordains into an Ordinance the attached
document this date of May 22, 2017. This Ordinance shall become effective on
June 13, 2017.



Part 2
Establishment of Zoning Districts



§ 27-201.   Establishment and Purposes of Districts.



   The Borough of Myerstown is hereby divided into Zoning Districts of
different types to carry out the objectives of this Ordinance. Each parcel of
land and every structure in the Borough, except as otherwise provided by law
or by this Ordinance, shall be subject to the regulations specified for the
District in which it is located. The Borough is divided into the following
Zoning Districts, with the following abbreviations and that serve the
following purposes, in addition to the overall purposes of this Ordinance:



      1.   LDR  Low Density Residential District - To provide for
and to protect the integrity of low density residential neighborhoods that
are primarily comprised of single family detached and semi-detached dwellings.



      2.   OT  Old Town Residential District - To provide for
medium density neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, in a manner that
respects and continues traditional forms of development.



      3.   TMN  Traditional Mixed Neighborhood District - To
provide for a mix of housing types and selected types of less intensive types
of commercial uses in areas that include many existing homes. The intent is
to avoid uses that are most likely to generate nuisances or hazards for
nearby residents, such as 24 hour operations.



      4.   TC  Town Center District - To provide for an orderly
coordinated development of varied commercial business, arts, cultural,
institutional and residential development in the downtown. To promote
pedestrian-friendly uses, as opposed to uses that are auto dependent.



      5.   GB  General Business District - To provide for a wide
variety of commercial uses, including more intensive commercial uses, in
areas that include fewer existing homes. To manage traffic to avoid
congestion and safety hazards, particularly in regards to access to major
streets.



      6.   LI  Light Industrial District - To provide for a variety
of industrial development, while not allowing for heavy industrial uses that
are likely to result in hazards or nuisances.



      7.   GI  General Industrial District - To provide suitable
areas for a wide variety of industrial uses and selected commercial uses,
including intensive uses that must be allowed under State law.



      8.   CN  Conservation District - To allow for only very
low-intensity development in areas of sensitive natural features. Many of
these areas are public parks or are within the 100 Year Floodway, which are
areas that are most vulnerable to severe flooding.



      9.   CF  Community Facility - To provide for larger public
and semi-public uses, cemeteries, and housing for older persons.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-202.   Zoning Map.



   The Borough of Myerstown Zoning Map shall consist of one or more map(s)
accurately showing the boundaries of various Zoning Districts. The zoning map
information may be maintained and updated using digital and/or paper
versions. At least one paper copy of the official map shall be maintained and
available in the office of the Zoning Officer. The zoning map and all notes
and measurements shown thereon are hereby incorporated by reference into this
Zoning Ordinance and shall be as much a part of this Zoning Ordinance as if
all were fully described in this text.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-203.   District Boundaries.



   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries between
Districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply.



      1.   Where District boundaries are indicated as approximately
coinciding with streets, alleys, waterways, or railroad rights-of-way, the
center line of such features shall be construed to be such boundaries, unless
otherwise indicated on the Map. The Zoning District boundaries shall extend
to the Borough border, even if a border is not accurately portrayed on the
Zoning Map.



      2.   Where District boundaries are indicated as approximately
coinciding with lot lines that existed at the time of the adoption of the
Zoning Map, they shall be construed as following such lot lines.



      3.   Where District boundaries do not coincide with a physical
feature or lot line, and are not fixed by dimensions on the Zoning Map or
notes, the boundary shall be determined using a scale.



      4.   Whenever any street, alley, or other public right-of-way
is vacated, the Zoning District adjoining each side of such street, alley, or
public right-of-way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation.

§ 27-206.   Uses Not Specifically Regulated.



   If a use clearly is not permitted by right or as a Special Exception
Use or a Conditional Use by this Ordinance within any Zoning District, the
use is prohibited, except that the Zoning Hearing Board may permit such use
as a Special Exception Use if the applicant specifically proves to the clear
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that all of the following conditions
would be met:



      1.   the proposed use would be no more intensive with respect
to external impacts and nuisances than uses that are allowed in the District,



      2.   the proposed use would be closely similar in impacts and
character to uses allowed in that District,



      3.   the use would meet the standards that would apply under
Section 27-1416.3. to a Special Exception Use, and



      4.   the use is not specifically prohibited in that District.

structure is located. Such uses shall only be allowed if the use complies
with all other requirements of this Ordinance.

[Note A] =   The minimum average lot area per apartment dwelling shall be
reduced to 750 square feet if a lot will include 6 or more dwelling units,
and each  dwelling unit will be restricted to occupancy by at least one
person age 62 or older or a person with disabilities, and there is no
occupancy by any person under age 18 years old.



[Note B] =   If an existing rear or side alley is available or could be
feasibly extended, it shall be used for access to parking spaces for the lot
instead of a front yard driveway, unless the Borough determines that another
access is more appropriate as part of a subdivision or land development
approval. If 2 or more side-by-side off-street parking spaces are located in
the front yard of a townhouse or if garage door(s) for 2 or more vehicles
face onto the street in the front of the townhouse, then the minimum building
width per dwelling along such street shall be a minimum of 24 feet. A maximum
of 60 percent of the land area between the front of each townhouse or
semi-detached dwelling and the street right-of-way line shall be used for
vehicle parking and driveways.



[Note C] =   The average density provisions are intended to allow
flexibility in the placement of individual dwelling units, regardless of
whether the homes are condominium or fee-simple, and regardless of whether
public streets, private streets or parking courts are used. No minimum lot
area applies for each individual dwelling unit, provided that the overall
density requirements are met. Each single family, semi-detached or townhouse
dwelling shall still be able to meet the minimum front yard, side yard, rear
yard and lot width as if each dwelling was on its own fee simple lot.



      -   The minimum average lot area per dwelling unit establishes
the maximum number of units permitted on a tract of land. The total lot area
of the tract prior to development is used. The area occupied by existing
street right-of-way of existing streets and alleys is then deleted. The
following areas are not required to be deleted from the lot area to determine
density: right-of-way of proposed streets and alleys and areas of parking
courts, common open space and stormwater detention basins. The resulting lot
area is then divided by the average lot area per dwelling unit to result in
the maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the tract.



[Note D] =   Setbacks shall be measured from the legal street
right-of-way, after any subdivision or land development has been completed.
An unenclosed front porch or deck may encroach up to 10 feet into the minimum
front yard. This porch or deck may be covered by a roof. Steps, stoops and
ramps for persons with disabilities may also encroach into this setback as
necessary to provide access, which may be beyond 10 feet.



[Note E] =    For townhouses and semi-detached dwellings, the maximum
building and impervious coverage requirements may be met as an average across
a tract after development, as opposed to regulating each individual lot.



[Note F] =   The following exceptions shall apply:



         - For accessory structures and uses, see Section 27-503
below.



         - Structures shall not obstruct minimum sight clearance at
intersections, as provided in Section 27-1303.3.



         - See Section 27-1305.3.B. regarding extension of
nonconforming setbacks.



         - See Section 27-504.C. regarding permitted reductions in
setbacks to reflect average setbacks of adjacent buildings.



[Note G] =   Abutting lots in common ownership may be calculated together
to show compliance with the maximum coverages.



[Note H] =    Except 0 feet at the shared lot line of lawfully attached
dwellings, such as along the lot line of semi-detached dwellings or
townhouses, or where a new attached building is constructed that replaces a
previous building that was attached to the same adjacent building, or where
the Borough approves adjacent business buildings to be constructed on a lot
line as part of a subdivision or land development.



[Note I] =    Except 20 feet side and 25 feet rear for a principal
business from a lot in a Residential District that is occupied by a principal
dwelling that is not in common ownership. Such side or rear yard shall be
increased to 60 feet from such a lot for any building area or land area used
for manufacturing, bulk storage of highly hazardous substances, industrial
outdoor processing or a tractor-trailer truck loading dock.



[Note J] =    A minimum 3 feet building setback is required from an
approximately parallel door or window of a building on another lot, unless a
larger setback is required under the Construction Code.



[Note K] =   Individual lots may be approved with a minimum lot area of
1,500 sq. ft. or smaller condominium parcels as part of a unified subdivision
or land development plan.



[Note L] =   The minimum lot width is measured at the part of the lot
where the minimum building front yard setback applies. If a building is
placed further back from the street, it will not change where the lot width
is measured.

(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-502.   Height Exceptions.



   Section 27-501 establishes maximum building heights for each
District.  The following provisions shall also apply:



      1.   Any accessory structure or building shall have a maximum
height of one habitable story or 20 feet, unless it meets the minimum
setbacks for a principal building, in which case the maximum height for a
principal building shall apply.



      2.   The maximum height requirements shall not apply to cranes
or similar mechanical devices.



      3.   A minimum building height of 20 feet shall apply for any
new principal building in the TC District.



      4.   The maximum structure height specified for each District
shall not apply to: antenna and communications towers that meet the
requirements of this Ordinance, water towers, clock or bell towers, steeples
and religious symbols attached to places of worship, utility lines and poles
and towers, elevator shafts, rooftop stairways, wind turbines that comply
with this Ordinance, skylights, chimneys, heating/ventilation/air
conditioning equipment, industrial mechanical equipment areas that are not
occupied by humans, or other appurtenances usually required to be and
customarily placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy.
See also definition of "Height" in Section 27-1502.



      5.   Solar energy collection devices may exceed the maximum
building height by 6 feet, provided the devices do not extend above the top
of the peak of a pitched residential roof.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-503.   Accessory Structures and Uses.



   1.   Accessory structures and uses shall meet the minimum yard
setbacks provided for in Section 27-501, unless otherwise provided for in
this Ordinance, including the following subsections.



   2.   The minimum side and rear yard setback for a permitted detached
structure that is accessory to a dwelling shall be 5 feet, except in the
following cases:



      A.   The minimum side setback shall be reduced to 3 feet on
each side and the rear for a residential accessory building that does not
include a dwelling and that has a total floor area of 144 square feet or
less, and a maximum height of 15 feet.



      B.   A side yard setback is not required for a structure that
is accessory to a dwelling from a lot line along which two dwellings are
attached (such as a lot line shared by semi-detached dwellings). However,
such structure shall still meet the minimum side yard on a lot line where the
dwellings are not attached.



      C.   A residential porch or deck that is unenclosed may extend
a maximum of 15 feet into the required rear setback. Such porch or deck may
be covered by a roof or awning. Space under an unenclosed porch may be used
for household storage. See Note D above considering front yard setbacks.



      D.   See Section 27-603.4. for swimming pools.



      E.   A vehicle garage that is accessory to a dwelling shall in
no case be setback less than 10 feet from the centerline of any alley which
provides access to the garage, unless a larger setback is established by
another section of this Ordinance.



      F.   No accessory building and no swimming pool shall be
allowed between the principal building and the front lot line.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-504.   Maximum Building Setback; Reduction in Front Setbacks.



   1.   In the OT, TMN or TC Districts, where a clear majority of the
existing principal buildings on the same side of a block are already
developed with buildings, and where the Zoning Officer determines that more
than 60 percent of such buildings have a front yard setback of 30 feet or
less along such side of the block, then if a new principal building is
proposed, then at least a portion of the front building wall of such new
building shall have a front yard building setback that is not more than 5
feet larger and not less than 5 feet smaller than such predominant front yard
setback. The maximum front yard setback may be met with an attached front
porch or a building wall. A maximum building setback shall not apply where
the area between the building and the curb is occupied by an outdoor café or
pedestrian plaza.



   2.   In the OT, TMN and TC District, any new principal building
shall have a maximum front building setback along a street of 25 feet. This
maximum building setback shall not apply in areas occupied by an outdoor
café or pedestrian plaza. The intent is to have new parking to the side and
rear of the building. This provision shall not prevent the construction of an
access driveway in the front.  On a corner lot, this provision shall only
apply to one of the two abutting public streets.



   3.   Where a subject lot has 2 abutting lots on the same side of the
street along the same block, and both of these lots have an existing front
yard building setback that is smaller than the setback that would be required
on the subject lot, then the subject lot may have a minimum front yard
setback that is equal to the average of those 2 abutting lots.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-505.   Dimensional Provisions for Solar Energy Collection Devices.



   1.   Parts 3 and 4 list where solar energy collection devices are
allowed, and the maximum percentage of lot area that can be covered.



   2.   See Section 27-502, which allows solar energy collection
devices to exceed the maximum height. Solar screens, awnings, or solar panels
that extend over building windows and that do not include any signage may
intrude into a building setback area by up to 10 feet.



The photo to the right shows an example of a solar shading extension of a
building roof that is intended to provide adjustable screening of the sun, to
cool a building on hot days and warm a building on  cold days.







 



   3.   Ground mounted and other solar energy collection devices that
are not located above a building roof shall not: (1) be located in a minimum
front yard and (2) have a total height above the ground of more than 15 feet,
unless they meet minimum setbacks for a principal building.



   4.   When an applicant owns two or more adjacent lots, and at least
one of those lots is proposed to utilize solar energy collection devices, the
applicant is requested to consider establishing a solar access easement or a
similar legal mechanism to make sure that structures or vegetation on one lot
does not unreasonably obstruct solar access for the solar energy collection
devices on the adjacent lot.



   5.   Where solar energy collection devices are being placed on a
building roof, it is requested that they be setback a minimum of 3 feet from
the side and bottom edges of the roof to allow for safer access by and less
risk of electrical shock to emergency responders.

Part 6
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses



§ 27-601.   Applicability.



   1.   This Article establishes additional requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the other requirements of this Ordinance. Where
two requirements directly conflict regarding the same matter, the stricter
requirement upon use or development shall apply.



   2.   For uses allowed within a specific Zoning District as "Special
Exception Uses," see also the procedures and standards in Section 27-1416.
For "Special Exception Uses," see Section 27-1417.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-602.   Additional Requirements for Specific Principal Uses.



   Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:



      1.   Adult Use. (This is limited to the following:  Adult
Store, Adult Movie Theater, Massage Parlor, or Adult Live Entertainment
Facility)



         A.   Purposes. The regulations on Adult Uses are
intended to serve the following purposes, in addition to the overall
objectives of this Ordinance.



            (1)   To recognize the adverse secondary impacts
of Adult Uses that affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of the
Borough. These secondary impacts have been documented in research conducted
across the nation. These secondary impacts typically include, but are not
limited to:  increases in criminal activity, increases in activities that
increase the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, increases
in activities that increase the risk of transmission of other communicable
diseases, increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods, and decreases in property values for surrounding homes, and
decreases in the marketability of nearby commercial business space. The
research conducted across the nation concludes that Adult Uses typically
involve insufficient self-regulation to control these secondary effects.



            (2)   To limit Adult Uses to locations where these
secondary impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect residential
neighborhoods and commercial revitalization.



            (3)   To not attempt to suppress any activities
protected by the "free speech" protections of the State and U.S.
Constitutions, but instead to control secondary effects.



         B.   An Adult Use and its parking area shall not be
located within any of the following distances, whichever is most restrictive:



            (1)   400 lineal feet from an existing dwelling on
another lot,



            (2)   250 lineal feet from the lot line of any lot
in a Residential Zoning District, and



            (3)    1,000 lineal feet from the lot line of any
primary or secondary school, place of worship, library, public park or
playground, recreation trail, day care center or nursery school.



         C.   No Adult Use shall be located within 250 lineal
feet from any existing "Adult Use."



         D.   A 50 feet buffer yard shall be provided along the
side and rear lot lines. If such buffer area does not include substantial
mature trees that will be preserved, it shall include continuous screening by
evergreen trees with an initial height of 5 feet.



         E.   No pornographic material, displays or words shall
be placed in view of persons who are not inside of the establishment.
Definite precautions shall be made to prohibit minors from entering the
premises.



         F.   No Adult Use shall be used for any purpose that
violates any Federal, State or municipal law.



         G.   Pornographic and sexually explicit signs and
displays shall be prohibited that are visible from outside of the premises.



         H.   The Adult Use shall not include the sale or display
of "obscene" materials, as defined by Pennsylvania criminal law, as may be
amended by applicable Court decisions.



         I.   An Adult Use shall be prohibited in all Districts
except where specifically allowed under Part 4. An Adult Use is a distinct
use, and shall not be allowed under any other use, such as a retail store or
club.



         J.   A minimum lot area of 30,000 square feet is
required.



         K.   For public health reasons, private or semi-private
viewing booths of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes, but is
not limited to, booths for viewing adult movies or nude dancers.



         L.   No use may include live actual or simulated sex
acts nor any sexual contact between employees and entertainers nor between
employees or entertainers and customers.



         M.   Only "lawful" massages as defined by State court
decisions shall be performed in a Massage Parlor.  A use that involves
massages by State-licensed massage therapists shall be considered a Personal
Service Use and not a Massage Parlor.



         N.   All persons within any Adult Use shall wear
non-transparent garments that cover their genitals and the female areola,
except within a permitted lawful "Adult live entertainment facility."



         O.   Any application for such use shall state the legal
name(s) of an on-site manager responsible to ensure compliance with this
Ordinance on a daily basis. A telephone number, official mailing address and
email address shall be provided where the on-site manager can be reached
during the hours when the business is open. The application shall also
include contact information, including the legal name, business phone number
and official mailing address for at least one individual who is the primary
owner, a corporate official, a partner or the managing staff-person of the
business. Such information shall be updated in writing to the Zoning Officer
within one business day after it changes.



         P.   The use shall not operate between the hours of 12
midnight and 7 a.m. If State liquor laws require that the Borough allow the
sale of alcohol during later hours, the Adult Uses shall still cease at
midnight.



         Q.   As specific conditions of approval under this
Ordinance, the applicant shall prove compliance, where applicable, with the
following State laws, as amended: the Pennsylvania Liquor Code,  Act 219 of
1990 (which pertains to sale or consumption of alcohol between 2 a.m. and 8
a.m.), Act 207 of 1990 (which pertains to obscenity) and Act 120 of 1996
(which pertains to Adult-Oriented Establishments and which limits enclosed
viewing booths among other matters).



         R.   An Adult Use shall be open to inspections during
business hours by Borough code enforcement staff, including health inspectors.



      2.   Adult Day Care Center.



         A.   The use shall be fully licensed by the State, if
required by the State.



         B.   The use shall include constant supervision during
all hours of operation.



         C.   The use shall not meet the definition of a
"treatment center."



      3.   After Hours Club.  This use is effectively prohibited by
State Act 219 of 1990, as amended (Section 7327 of Title 18 of the
Pennsylvania Statutes).  If the use is determined to be allowed under State
law, then the applicant shall be a special exception use that is only allowed
in the HIC district. In such case, the applicant shall prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that there will be adequate security
and noise control measures.



      4.   Animal Cemetery.



         A.   All the regulations for a "Cemetery" in this
Section shall apply.



         B.   The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Officer (or the Zoning Hearing Board in the case of a special
exception use) that the use will be conducted in such a manner that the
public health and groundwater quality will not be threatened.



      5.   Animal Day Care.



         A.   This use shall involve providing temporary care and
recreation for multiple dogs and household pets.  This use shall primarily
involve housing the animals indoors within an enclosed air conditioned
building that is sound-proofed if the animals will be within 200 feet from an
existing dwelling. 



         B.   This use shall not primarily involve the keeping of
animals for more than 24 hours, unless the requirements are also met for a
Kennel.



Apartments - See "Townhouses and Apartments" and "Conversions" in this
Section.



      6.   Assisted Living Facility/ Personal Care Home.  The
standards for "Nursing Homes" in this section shall apply.



      7.   Auto, Boat or Mobile/ Manufactured Home Sales.



         A.   No vehicle, boat or home on display shall occupy
any part of the street right-of-way or required customer parking area. See
buffer yard provisions in Section 27-1303.



         B.   See light and glare standards in Section 27-1007.



         C.   Any mobile/manufactured homes on a sales site shall
meet the required principal building setbacks from the perimeter lot lines.



         D.   This use shall encompass sales and rental of all
types of motor vehicles and trailers, including recreational vehicles.



      8.   Auto Repair Garage.



         A.   All paint work shall be performed within a
building, with a fume collection and ventilation system that directs fumes
away from any adjacent dwellings. Outdoor major repairs (such as body work
and grinding) and outdoor welding shall not occur within 100 feet of a
"residential lot line."



         B.   All reasonable efforts shall be made to prevent or
minimize noise, odor, vibration, light or electrical interference to adjacent
lots. See standards in Part 10. See buffer yard requirements in Section
27-1303.



         C.   Outdoor storage of motor vehicles shall not be
within any required buffer yard or street right-of-way. Motor vehicles shall
not be parked on a public sidewalk.



         D.   Overnight outdoor storage of "junk" other than
permitted vehicles shall be prohibited within view of a public street or a
dwelling.



         E.   Any "junk vehicle" (as defined by Section 27-1502)
shall not be stored for more than 60 days within view of a public street or a
dwelling, unless it is actively under repair. A maximum of 10 junk vehicles
may be parked on a lot outside of an enclosed building at any one time,
unless they are actively under repair.  Vehicles shall not be parked on a
public sidewalk.



         F.   Service bay doors shall not face directly towards
an abutting dwelling (not including a dwelling separated from the garage by a
street) if another reasonable alternative exits.



      9.   Auto Service Station.

open to the interior of the building, if there are security issues, but
instead can be enclosed display windows.



   2.   Site Compatibility.



      A.   To the maximum extent feasible, new surface off-street
parking shall be located to the rear or side of principal buildings, as
opposed to being newly placed between the front lot line along a street and
the front wall of a new principal building. This provision shall not limit
rearrangement of spaces within existing parking areas. This provision shall
not prohibit vehicle parking to the side of a principal building adjacent to
a street. If such lot is adjacent to two or more streets, this restriction
shall only apply to the one street that is the most heavily traveled by
vehicles.



      B.   Chain-link exposed metal fencing shall not be placed in
the front yard. Picket or ornamental fences are encouraged, or chain link
that is coated in dark colored plastic.  Highway-style metal guide rails
should not be used on private property if visible from a street.



      C.   See street tree, parking lot tree and other landscaping
provisions in Section 1361.04.



   3.   Pedestrian Orientation and Safety.



      A.   Pedestrian traffic shall be carefully considered in all
drive-through designs, particularly to make sure there are adequate sight
distances.



      B.   Business buildings shall have their main pedestrian
entrance facing a street or a pedestrian walkway/plaza, or be located within
a maximum of 30 feet from the front sidewalk along the street.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-703.   Additional Requirements in the CF District.



   1.   A maximum of 50 percent of the front facade of a new building
that faces onto Main Street or College Street shall be comprised of exposed
metal panels.  Windows, doors and facade materials (such as materials with
the appearance of brick or textured block) may be used in front of a metal
sided building to meet this requirement.  This provision does not apply to
roofing materials. If such lot is adjacent to 2 or more streets, this
restriction shall apply to the one street that is the most heavily traveled
by vehicles.



   2.   Pedestrian traffic shall be carefully considered in all
drive-through designs, particularly to make sure there are adequate sight
distances.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-704.   Recommended Design Guidelines in All Districts.



   The following recommended guidelines should be considered in the design
of new construction, additions and exterior alterations.  Some of these
features may be required by other sections of this Ordinance in specific
cases.  The provisions in 27-701 and 27-702 should also be used as
recommended guidelines in Districts where a provision is not required.



   1.   Site Compatibility.



      A.   See buffer yard requirements in Section 27-1303.4.,
including provisions addressing eye-level views through plantings for
security purposes along a street.



      B.   Vehicle parking and any garage doors should be placed to
the rear of buildings as opposed to between buildings and the street. A rear
or side alley should be used for garage or parking access when feasible for
dwellings. Where rear parking is not practical, then parking should be
provided to the side of a building. Where a residential driveway needs to
enter from the front, the garage should be setback further from the street
than the front facade of a principal residential building, and the driveway
should be as narrow as practical through the front yard. If a residential
driveway is necessary in the front of a lot, the curb cut should be a maximum
of 10 feet wide, except 20 feet may be necessary for a driveway serving
multiple units or that serves side-by-side parking spaces.



      C.   Shared parking among property owners and businesses is
encouraged where adequate parking spaces exist for shared usage.



      D.   Landscaping, low walls that have the appearance of brick,
or similar features should be used to buffer parking lots from streets,
provided that there is still sufficient views into the parking area at eye
level (approximately 4 to 5 feet) for security purposes.



      E.   Various signs on a property should be coordinated.
Internally illuminated signs of box-type construction with a plastic face
should be avoided. Signs should not cover architectural details. Awnings that
extend at a straight angle from a building are encouraged to provide
continuity along a block front and weather protection. Awnings should be used
to reduce the visibility of roll-down security gate mechanisms. The front
panel of an awning may be used for a sign, but the sign image should be
integrated with the awning and the awning should have the appearance of a
fabric-type material.



      F.   Adequate lighting shall be provided for security, but in
a manner that does not generate glare. In historic areas, traditional styles
of light poles should be used, with a maximum height of 20 feet. The
unfiltered luminaire itself (such as in a floodlight) should not be directly
visible from a street or sidewalk.



      G.   Chain-link metal fences should be avoided in the front
yard. Picket or ornamental fences are encouraged. Solid wooden or vinyl plank
fences should be placed in rear and side yards only. Highway-style metal
guide rails should not be used.



      H.   New utilities should be placed underground. Where that is
not practical, they should be placed in less visible parts of the site. For
example, new utility lines should be extended from the rear of the property
instead of the front. New utility meters should be hidden from view from the
street frontage.



      I.   See trash dumpsters screening and location standards in
Section 27-1306.



      J.   Where new sidewalks are constructed, consideration should
be given to using pervious pavers between the main concrete sidewalk and the
curb.



   2.   Building Compatibility.



      A.   New construction should have a front yard setback that is
similar to adjacent older buildings, where there is a predominant setback of
less than 30 feet from the street.



      B.   Awnings should be used to add visual interest and to
provide cover during rainy weather.



      C.   Modern additions and features should be placed towards
the rear of a historic building.



      D.   New construction should have rooflines that are similar
to adjacent older buildings. Flat roofs should be avoided, except when a
decorative cornice is used. Where a pitched roof is not practical, then the
roof should at least appear to have angles and a pitch when viewed from the
street.



      E.   Where existing older buildings have a certain spacing of
windows and doors, similar spacing, and similar sizes of windows and doors,
should be continued in new construction. Blank walls without door and window
openings should be avoided along a street.



      F.   Particularly where most buildings along a block have
front porches, a front porch should be incorporated into new construction.
Existing older front porches should be maintained and not be enclosed.



      G.   Tractor-trailer truck loading docks are discouraged from
being visible from a street.



      H.   Where allowed by the Borough, an applicant should
consider offering the option in a building of a "Live Work Unit," such as a
building that encourages a person to work on the first floor and live in the
upper stories.



      I.   Standard "franchise brand" facades should be modified in
such a way as to become compatible with the character of historic areas.



      J.   Every effort should be made to rehabilitate and reuse
older buildings that have historic architecture.  If a building cannot
feasibly be reused, then consideration should be given to building a new
building behind a significant restored facade.



      K.   Along streets in other Districts where 2 or more story
buildings are common, single story buildings should be avoided, unless they
have the appearance of a 2 story building when viewed from the front along
the street.



      L.   Overly garish or day-glow colors should be avoided on
commercial buildings. Colors should highlight architectural details and
character, and be compatible with the neighborhood context.



      M.   Buildings should avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted
walls.  Instead, there should be variations in a front facade, such as
changes in building setbacks, colors, details, materials or rooflines.



      N.   Commercial HVAC systems should be screened from view from
the front of a lot using walls, fencing, roof elements or landscaping.







      O.   Noisy or odor-producing ventilation equipment (such as
fast food restaurant exhaust fans) should be placed as far away from
dwellings as is feasible.



   3.   Pedestrian Safety and Orientation.



      A.   Pedestrian crosswalks should be provided along arterial
street corridors using materials and colors that visually distinguish the
crosswalk from the street surface and that include some texture. A method
should be used that is durable, instead of simply being adhered to the top of
the asphalt.



      B.   Pedestrian traffic should be separated from major vehicle
routes. Developments should be designed in such a way as to be inviting for
pedestrian traffic and to provide convenient walking routes from any public
transit stops.







      C.   Individual buildings and pedestrian entrances and parking
areas should be laid out to promote pedestrian access among different uses,
and to provide pedestrian connections towards bus and rail stops.



      D.   Pedestrian-related uses and features providing visual
interest and vitality for pedestrians are encouraged along main streets.
Storefronts, pedestrian entrances and display windows should relate to the
street, rather than be focused directly towards a parking lot.  Large
parking lots, blank building faces and non-pedestrian-related uses are
discouraged along major pedestrian streets.



      E.   Concrete sidewalks should be used for the main route used
by wheelchairs and most un-motored pedestrians. Pervious pavers should be
used to add decorative elements along the curb, and to allow water and air to
reach street trees.







      F.   Where there will be a major pedestrian crossing of a busy
street, a pedestrian and wheelchair refuge island should be considered, so
that they only have to cross one direction of traffic at a time.







      G.   Sight distance requirements are addressed in Section
27-1303.3.  Signs should also be considered to warn pedestrians and
motorists of areas where there are limited sight distances.

Part 8
Historic Building Demolition Approval Process and Incentives



§ 27-801.   Purposes.



   In addition to serving the overall purposes of this Ordinance, this
Part 8 is intended to:



      1.   promote the retention of community character through
preservation of the local heritage by recognition and protection of historic
and architectural resources;



      2.   encourage continued use, appropriate rehabilitation and
adaptive reuse of historic buildings;



      3.   implement Sections 603(b), 603(g), 604(1) and 605(2) of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, which address protecting and
facilitating the preservation of historic values through zoning and using
zoning to regulate uses and structures at or near places having unique
historic, architectural or patriotic interest or value; and



      4.   strengthen the local economy by promoting heritage
tourism, improving property values and increasing investment in older
buildings.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-802.   Applicability.



   This Part 8 shall apply to buildings on the Historic Building List that
is adopted as part of this Ordinance, as may be amended. This Section shall
only apply to the principal building on the property.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-803.   Demolition Controls.



   1.   Demolition shall be defined as the dismantling, tearing down,
removal or razing of the exterior of a building, in whole or in part. This
term shall not include changes to the interior of a building, provided such
changes do not alter the structural integrity of the building. A partial
demolition shall mean: 1) removal of exterior portions of a building, or 2)
removal of original exterior architectural features, such as, but not limited
to, an attached porch roof, porch columns, cornices, exterior window details
or similar features.



   2.   A building on the Historic Buildings List shall not be
demolished, including any partial demolition, unless the applicant proves to
the satisfaction of the Borough Council as a conditional use that one or more
of the following conditions exist:



      A.   The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be
reused, and that such situation is not the result of intentional neglect or
demolition by neglect by the current owner or a person who owned the property
within the previous two years; or



      B.   The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner, and the hardship was not self-created; or



      C.   The demolition is necessary to allow a specific
development or transportation project to occur that will have substantial and
unusual public benefits that will greatly outweigh the loss of the building
(such as the establishment or expansion of a major employer, or the
development or expansion of a needed community facility); or



      D.   The design of the replacement building will result in a
net improvement to the streetscape.



   3.   Application.  Prior to conducting a complete or partial
demolition, a complete application for such work shall be submitted by the
applicant in writing, and such demolition shall need prior approval under
this Part. After a complete application has been filed, it shall be forwarded
to the Borough Planning Commission members, and the Commission should be
allowed an opportunity to provide a review at a meeting. This application
shall include the following:



      A.   The name, address and daytime telephone number of the
owner of record and the applicant for the demolition.



      B.   Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for
demolition. If the applicant is alleging that the building cannot be reused
or rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor plans shall be provided as
needed to support the applicant's claim.



      C.   A site plan drawn to scale showing existing buildings and
the proposed demolition.



      D.   A written statement of the reasons for the demolition.



      E.   The proposed use of the site, and a proposed timeline for
development of that proposed use.



   4.   Evidence. The applicant shall provide sufficient credible
evidence to justify any claims that a building cannot feasibly be repaired or
reused.  The Borough Council may require that an applicant submit a written
and signed report or in-person testimony by a qualified professional and/or
written cost estimates from bona fide contractors to support a claim.



   5.   Emergency. The Zoning Officer shall issue a zoning permit for
the demolition without compliance with the demolition approval requirements
of this Part 8 if the Construction Codes Official certifies in writing that
the building represents a clear and immediate hazard to public safety, and
that no other reasonable alternatives exist to demolition.



   6.   Replacement.  Where new construction or vehicle parking is
proposed in place of the demolished building, information about the proposed
use shall be provided prior to approval of the demolition.



   7.   Exceptions. Conditional use approval shall not be needed for
the following:



      A.   Interior renovations or removal of features (such as a
rear porch) that do not harm the structural stability of the building and
that are not visible from a public street (not including improvements that
are only visible from a rear or side alley of less than 14 feet cartway).



      B.   Removal of features that were added after January 1,
1940, such as a modern porch, aluminum siding or a carport.



      C.   Relocation of a building within the Borough, provided
that the relocation does not result in a partial or complete demolition that
is regulated by this Part 8.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-804.   Additional Uses Allowed Within Historic Buildings.



   1.   This Section 27-804 allows certain additional uses if the use
would be within a building on the Historic Sites List.  If the use is
already allowed as a permitted by right use in the Zoning District, it shall
continue to be permitted by right. The following additional uses shall be
allowed as special exception uses within such a building:



      A.   The development of one or more dwelling units within the
building.



      B.   The conversion of such a building into an office,
personal service use, restaurant, retail stores, art/custom crafts studio,
bank or art gallery.  Any drive-through service windows shall be placed as
far as practical from the front facade of the building.



      C.   The conversion of such a building into a bed and
breakfast inn, college use, primary or secondary school, or a hotel.



      D.   The conversion of the building into another use that the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board would be
appropriate, considering the adjacent uses, without creating hazards to the
public health and safety.



   2.   To be eligible for these uses, the applicant shall first submit
architectural plans to the Zoning Officer and the Zoning Hearing Board
showing the extent of changes proposed to the exterior of the front of the
building as viewed from a public street that are proposed as part of the
change of use and/or any building expansion. 



   3.   The building may be expanded, provided the expansion meets all
of the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance. 



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-805.   Modifications.



   As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board shall have the
authority to modify yard, coverage and other dimensional requirements for a
lot occupied by a building on the Historic Buildings List if the applicant
proves to the Zoning Hearing Board that such modifications are necessary to
promote the historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of such building.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-806.   Historic Building List.



   The following buildings are hereby included on the Historic Building
List.  In many cases, a historic name is provided for each building, along
with an address. Additional buildings may be added to this list, or the list
may be revised in the future as a Zoning Ordinance Amendment, after a public
hearing by Borough Council.

Part 9
Floodplain Regulations (Overlay District)



§ 27-901.   General Floodplain Provisions and Statutory Authorization.



   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Floodplain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough has enacted the following regulations:



      1.   Purposes. This Part is intended to:



         A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of
the Borough, while carrying out the Pennsylvania Floodplain Management Act,
as amended and meeting the requirements of the Federal Flood Insurance
Program;



         B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate
construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the
future;



         C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting
water supply and natural drainage;



         D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community,
its governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding;



         E.   Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements;



         F.   Minimize the risks to rescue workers, and the need
for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding, which are often
undertaken at public expense;



         G.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



         H.   Minimize damage to public facilities and other
utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets and bridges;



         I.   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent
properties within or near flood-prone areas;



         J.   Provide that the flood storage and conveyance
functions of floodplains are maintained;



         K.   Minimize the impact of development on the natural
and beneficial functions of floodplains; and



         L.   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous
or environmentally incompatible.



      2.   Applicability.



         A.   It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development or
other activity regulated by this Part unless a Floodplain Permit has been
obtained from the Floodplain Administrator if that activity would be within
the 100 year floodplain.



         B.   A Floodplain Permit shall not be required for minor
repairs to existing buildings or structures that do not involve activities or
impacts regulated by this Part.



      3.   Greater Restrictions. This Part supersedes any directly
conflicting Borough ordinance provisions which may be in effect in identified
floodplain areas. However, where a provision of this Part and a provision of
another section of this Ordinance or another Borough Ordinance apply to
similar matters but do not directly conflict, both provisions shall continue
to be in effect.



      4.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood
protection sought by the provisions of this Ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering
methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased
by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages.



      This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the
Myerstown or any officer or employee or consultant thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any determination
lawfully made under this Part.



      5.   Floodplain Definitions. See Section 27-908 .



      6.   Severability. Section 3 in Part 1 shall apply.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-902.   Floodplain Administration.



   1.   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Zoning Officer
is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this Part and is referred to
herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The Borough Council may in writing by
resolution designate a different person or entity to serve as the Floodplain
Administrator.



   2.   Administration of any part of these regulations by another
entity shall not relieve the Borough of its responsibilities pursuant to the
participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.



   3.   Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.



      A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a Floodplain
Permit only after it has been determined that the proposed work to be
undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance. A
Construction Permit may also be needed.



      B.   Prior to the issuance of any permit under this Part, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review the application to determine if other
necessary government environmental permits required by state and federal laws
have been obtained, such as those required under the Pennsylvania Dam Safety
and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended), the Pennsylvania Clean
Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended), and/or the U.S. Clean Water Act,
Section 404, 33 U.S.C. 1344. A floodplain permit shall not be issued unless
such approvals have been obtained or unless the permit is conditioned upon
proof of compliance with such requirement.



      C.   During the construction period, the Floodplain
Administrator or other authorized official shall inspect the premises to

   13.   Enclosures Under the Regulatory Flood Level.  If a building
includes an enclosure under the lowest floor or a crawl/underfloor space that
is more than 4 feet in vertical height, then the application shall be
required to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a signed Declaration of
Land Restriction/Non-Conversion Agreement that restricts any new use of that
space in a manner that would conflict with this Part.  Such agreement shall
be recorded on the property deed and be submitted to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-903.   Identification of Floodplain Areas.



   1.   Identification.



      A.   The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the
Borough of Myerstown, classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) dated June 5, 2012 and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.



      B.   The "500 Year Floodplain" shall be any areas of Myerstown
that are designated as Zone X ("areas of 0.2% annual chance of flood") in the
FIRMs as effective June 5, 2012, as issued by FEMA or the most recent
revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.



      C.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments issued by FEMA are hereby adopted by the Borough of
Myerstown and declared to be a part of this ordinance.



   2.   Description of and Special Requirements Within the Identified
Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the
following specific areas:



      A.   The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the
FIS and the FIRM as Floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include Floodway areas which have
been identified in other available studies or sources of information for
those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no Floodway has been identified in the
FIS and FIRM.



         (1)   Within any Floodway area, no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the Borough during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.



         (2)   Within any Floodway area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from
the DEP Regional Office.



      B.   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.



         (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the Floodway shall be
those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a Floodway has
been delineated.



         (2)   AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been
determined.



            (a)   No permit shall be granted for any
construction, development, use, or activity within any AE Area/District
without Floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.



            (b)   No new construction or development shall be
located within the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any
watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the DEP Regional
Office.



      C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an
A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and Floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.



      D.   In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses and computations shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Borough.



   3.   Changes in Identification of Area. The Identified Floodplain
Area may be revised by the Borough Council in writing where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for
such revision if, prior to any such change to the Special Flood Hazard Area,
written approval has been obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than 6 months after the date such information
becomes available, the Borough shall notify FEMA of the changes to the
Special Flood Hazard Area by submitting technical or scientific data. See
also Section 27-904 .1.A. for situations where FEMA notification is required.



   4.   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Floodplain Administrator and any party with standing who challenges that
determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.



   5.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. Prior to development occurring
in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are proposed or
have occurred, the Borough shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands
subject to boundary changes.  The Borough shall adopt and enforce floodplain
regulations in areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes
which meet or exceed those in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 44 60.3.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-904.   Floodplain Technical Provisions.



   1.   General.



      A.   Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.



         (1)   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any
kind shall be made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the Zoning Officer, and
until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from the DEP
Regional Office.



         (2)   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any
kind shall be made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the
activity will not reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.



         (3)   In addition, FEMA and DCED shall be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.



         (4)   An applicant for any proposed floodplain map

         (1)   This subsection B. shall apply when the Borough
proposes to permit the following encroachments:



            (a)   any development that causes a rise in the
base flood elevations within the Floodway; or



            (b)   any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and
Zone AE without a designated Floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or



            (c)   alteration or relocation of a stream
(including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges).



         (2)   Where an activity is proposed as listed in
subsection A. above, the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12), apply to
FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur.



            (a)   Upon receipt of the Administrator's
conditional approval of map change and prior to approving the proposed
encroachments, the Borough shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood
elevations and / or revised Floodway reflecting the post-project condition.



            (b)   Upon completion of the proposed
encroachments, the Borough shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will
initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in
accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.



      C.   Any new construction, development, uses or activities
allowed within any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the provisions contained in this Ordinance and any other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.

as determined in accordance with Section 27-903.2. of this Ordinance.



         (3)   In AO Zones, any new construction shall have the
lowest floor (including any basement) at or above the highest adjacent grade
at least as high as the depth number specified on the FIRM.



         (4)   The design and construction standards and
specifications contained in the currently effective IBC and IRC or the most
recent revisions thereof and ASCE 24 and 34 PA Code (Chapters 401-405 as
amended) shall be utilized, where they are more restrictive.



      B.   Non-residential Structures.



         (1)   In AE, A1-30 and AH Zones, any new construction or
substantial improvement of a non-residential structure shall have the lowest
floor elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation, or be
designed and constructed so that the space enclosed below the "regulatory
flood elevation" (as defined in Section 27-908):



            (a)   is floodproofed so that the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and,



            (b)   has structural components with the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy:



         (2)   In A Zones, where there are no Base Flood
Elevations specified on the FIRM, any new construction or substantial
improvement shall have the lowest floor elevated or completely floodproofed
up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation (as defined in Section
27-908), as determined in accordance with Section 27-902.3 of this ordinance.



         (3)   Any non-residential structure, or part thereof,
made watertight below the regulatory flood elevation shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the WI or W2 space classification standards contained in the
publication entitled "Flood-Proofing Regulations" published by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (June 1972, as amended March 1992) or with some other
equivalent standard. All plans and specifications for such floodproofing
shall be accompanied by a statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect which states that the proposed design and methods of
construction are in conformance with the above referenced standards.



         (4)   The design and construction standards and

      C.   Space Below the Lowest Floor.



         (1)   Any fully enclosed space below the lowest floor
(which shall not be permitted to be used as a basement) shall be used solely
for the parking of a vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an
area other than a basement.  Such fully enclosed space shall be designed and
constructed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters for the
purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on exterior walls.  Any new
building including such fully enclosed space shall be constructed using flood
damage-resistant materials (see NFIP Technical Bulletin No. 1). The term
"fully enclosed space" also includes crawl spaces.



         (2)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria:

rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined in
this ordinance must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.



         (2)   Documentation that a specific requirement of this
Part will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained
from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation
Officer. Any exemption from requirements of this Part 9 will be the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.



      E.   Accessory Structures. Structures accessory to a principal
building need not be elevated or floodproofed to remain dry, but shall
comply, at a minimum, with the following requirements:



         (1)   the structure shall not be designed or used for
human habitation, but shall be limited to the parking of vehicles, or to the
storage of tools, material, and equipment related to the principal use or
activity;



         (2)   floor area shall not exceed 200 square feet;



         (3)   The structure will have a low damage potential;

automatically provide for the entry and exit of floodwater for the purpose of
equalizing hydrostatic forces on the walls. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:



            (a)   a minimum of two openings having a net total
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed space;



            (b)   the bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade; and



            (c)   openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, etc. or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters.



   3.   Design and Construction Standards. The following minimum
standards shall apply for all construction and development proposed within
any identified floodplain area:



      A.   Fill. If fill is used, it shall:



         (1)   extend laterally at least 15 feet beyond the
building line from all points;



         (2)   consist of soil or small rock materials only, and
shall not permit a Sanitary Landfill;



         (3)   be compacted to provide the necessary permeability
and resistance to erosion, scouring, or settling;



         (4)   be no steeper than one vertical to two horizontal
feet unless substantiated data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to,
and approved by the Floodplain Administrator; 



         (5)   be used to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties; and



         (6)   include adequate measures to avoid erosion
associated with the expected velocities during the base flood. 



      B.   Drainage Facilities. Storm drainage facilities shall be
designed to convey the flow of storm water runoff in a safe and efficient
manner. The system shall ensure proper drainage along streets, and provide

the Zoning Officer may require that the applicant provide a suitable wetland
delineation study prepared by a qualified professional. Where disturbance is
proposed in an area that may be wetlands, the Zoning Officer may place a
condition on a zoning permit to require that the applicant submit evidence
that a wetland delineation has been officially confirmed under U.S. Army of
Engineers-approved procedures.

   2.   Reduced Need Populations.



      A.   The above table includes reductions in parking for
housing limited to persons over certain ages.



      B.   In addition, as a special exception use, the Zoning
Hearing Board may approve a reduction of up to 50 percent in the required
number of off-street parking spaces for an institutional or residential use
based upon written evidence that is provided that the typical residents or
clients will not be physically able or allowed to operate a vehicle from the
site because of their disabilities or similar conditions.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1102.   General Regulations for Off-Street Parking.



   1.   General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to
result in safe and orderly use, and to fully take into account all of the
following:  vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement
within the site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-thru
facilities. No parking area shall cause a safety hazard, or an impediment to
traffic off the lot.



   2.   Existing Parking.



      A.   Any parking spaces serving such pre-existing structures
or uses at the time of adoption of this Ordinance shall not in the future be
reduced in number below the number required by this Ordinance.



      B.   If a new principal non-residential building is
constructed on a lot, then any existing parking on such lot that serves such
building shall be reconfigured to comply with this Ordinance, including but
not limited to, requirements for channelization of traffic from adjacent
streets, channelization of traffic within the lot, minimum aisle widths,
paving and landscaping.



   3.   Change in Use or Expansion. A structure or use in existence at
the effective date of this Ordinance that expands or changes in use of an
existing principal building shall be required to provide all of the required
parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except as follows:



      A.   If a non-residential use expands by an aggregate total
maximum of 5 percent in the applicable measurement (such as building floor
area) beyond what existed at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, then no
additional parking is required. For example, if an existing building included
3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of 150 square feet was
proposed, then additional parking would not be required. This addition
without providing new parking shall only be allowed one time per lot.



      B.   An existing non-conforming deficit in the numbers of
parking spaces can be grandfathered. For example, if an existing business
would be required to provide 6 spaces and only 3 spaces are provided, and the
use changes to needing 8 total spaces, then only 5 total spaces need to be
provided (3 existing spaces plus 2 spaces for the change in use).



   4.   Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All
required numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still exist,
and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the minimum required by
this Ordinance. No required parking area or off-street loading spaces shall
be used for any other use (such as storage or display of materials) that
interferes with the area's availability for parking.



   5.   Location of Parking.



      A.   Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same
lot or abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a method of providing
the spaces is guaranteed to be available during all of the years the use is
in operation within 300 feet walking distance from the entrance of the
principal use being served. The 300 feet distance may be increased to 500
feet for parking serving employees or company vehicles. A written and signed
lease shall be provided, if applicable. A sign shall direct persons to the
parking spaces.



         (1)   The Zoning Officer may require evidence at any
time that shows that the parking continues to be available for the use. If
such parking is not available in the future, the zoning permit shall be
considered to have been revoked, unless the applicant proves that other
parking is provided that meets the requirement.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1103.   Design Standards for Off-Street Parking.



   1.   General Requirements.



      A.   Backing Onto a Street. No parking area of 4 or more
parking spaces shall be designed to require or encourage parked vehicles to
back into a public street in order to leave a parking space, except for a
driveway that enters onto a local street or a parking court. Parking spaces
may back onto an alley.



      B.   Except for spaces serving one household, every required
parking space shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may proceed to and
from the parking space provided for it without requiring the moving of any
other vehicle.



      C.   Parking areas shall not extend into a required buffer
yard. New parking spaces shall only be allowed within a street right-of-way
where they are specifically approved by the Borough.



      D.   Separation from Street. Except for parking spaces
immediately in front of individual dwellings, all areas for off-street
parking, off-street loading and unloading and the storage or movement of
motor vehicles shall be physically separated from the street by a continuous
grass or landscaped planting strip, except for necessary and approved vehicle
entrances and exits to the lot. See landscaping provisions in Section 27-1304
.



      E.   Stacking and Obstructions. Each lot shall provide
adequate area upon the lot to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street
while awaiting entry to the lot, or while waiting for service at a
drive-through facility.



      F.   Provisions Allowing Flexibility or Reduction of Parking
Requirements.



         (1)   Purposes. To minimize impervious surfaces, while
ensuring adequate parking, and to recognize unique circumstances that may
justify a reduction in required parking.



         (2)   Reduction. The Zoning Hearing Board may permit a
reduction, through the Special Exception process, of the number of parking
spaces that would otherwise be required if the Applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Board that less parking spaces are needed.



            (a)   Proof. To prove that fewer parking spaces
are needed, in the written application, the applicant shall provide existing
and projected employment, customer, resident or other relevant data. Such
data may include a study of parking at similar developments during peak
periods of use.



            (b)   Shared Parking. Under this Section, an
Applicant may seek to prove that parking permanently shared with another use
or another lot with shared internal access or another lot within 500 feet
will reduce the total amount of parking needed because the uses have
different peak times of parking need or overlapping customers.



               (i)   For example, an Applicant may prove
that a use with peak parking needs during late evenings or weekends (such as
a theater, bowling alley or place of worship) can reasonably share parking
with a use with peak parking needs during daytime weekdays (such as a bank or
office).



               (ii)   Reduced parking requirements for
joint parking shall only continue in effect as long as such uses or their
closely similar successor uses remain in operation, and shall be guaranteed
by a legally binding agreement. If such agreement becomes legally
ineffective, then all parking shall be provided as would otherwise be
required by this Part.



            (c)   Reservation of Future Parking Areas. If a
reduction is permitted under this Section, the Board may require as a
condition of the special exception that the lot include the reservation,
permanently or for a specified number of years, of areas sufficient to
otherwise meet the required number of spaces, if needed in the future.



               (i)   Such reservation shall be provided in
a legal form acceptable to the Zoning Hearing Board such as a legally binding
deed restriction and be officially filed with the Zoning Officer.



               (ii)   In such case, the Applicant shall be
required to submit site plans to the Zoning Officer showing where and how the
additional parking could be accomplished. Such future parking areas shall not
be covered by buildings and shall be attractively landscaped unless needed
for parking.



               (iii)   Such additional parking shall be
required to be provided within one year after the Zoning Officer may
determine it to be necessary to meet actual demand. Such determination may be
made based upon field analysis by the Zoning Officer.



            (d)   As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall have the authority to modify off-street parking requirements,
considering the total impact of the new uses of the lot versus the previous
uses, and considering whether a percentage of customers are likely to arrive
by public transit and/or walking. The Board may also approve a reduction in
the required parking if the applicant proves that there is an excess of
on-street parking spaces during hours when the business will have its peak
demand.



   2.   Size and Marking of Parking Spaces.



      A.   Each parking space shall be a rectangle with a minimum
width of 9 feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except the minimum sized
rectangle shall be 8 feet by 22 feet for parallel parking, except as provided
for parking for persons with disabilities in Section "7." below. Larger
parking spaces are required for persons with disabilities, as provided below.
A maximum of 10 percent of required parking spaces may be 9 by 16 feet if
they are clearly marked as "Compact Cars Only" and provided they are not the
most conveniently located spaces.



      B.   All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location,
except those of a one or two family dwelling, and except where stone parking
may be allowed.



      C.   Motorcycle parking spaces may be provided with a minimum
size of 9 by 9 feet. Each 2 motorcycle parking spaces may count as one
required regular parking space, comprising up to 5 percent of the total
required number of spaces.



      D.   Bicycle parking. If a lot will include more than 10,000
square feet of new commercial building space or 10 or more dwelling units, a
bike rack or similar feature shall be provided to allow locking of bicycles
without obstructing sidewalks. For dwellings, a suitable indoor area may be
provided, instead of a public bike rack.



   3.   Parking Aisles. The aisle width of required parking shall
comply with the following table:





Parking Angle (in degrees)
 
Minimum Aisle Width (in feet)*



Parallel to 25

12 (except 20 feet for 2-way traffic)

25 to 47

13 (one-way traffic only)

48 to 52

14 (one-way traffic only)

53 to 58

15 (one-way traffic only)

59 to 62

69 to 72

18 (one-way traffic only)

73 to 85

20 (one-way traffic only)

86 to 90

20 (except 24 feet for 2-way traffic)

 



   For parking at an angle of 45 degrees or greater, the minimum aisle
width may be reduced one foot where the adjacent parking spaces have a width
of 10 feet or greater.



   Within an underground parking structure or an above-ground parking
structure, the minimum aisle width may be reduced by one foot.



   4.   Driveways. See also the Lebanon County Access Management
Ordinance.



      A.   



 

Width of Driveway at Entrance onto a Public Street, at the edge of the
cartway*
 
One-Way Use*
 
Two-Way Use*


Minimum
 
10 feet
 
20 feet


Maximum
 
24 feet
 
28 feet



 



      *   This standard may be revised where PennDOT requires a
different standard for an entrance to a State road, or where the applicant
demonstrates to the Zoning Officer that a wider width is needed for truck
access.



      B.   Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of
driveway entry. The Borough may require an applicant to install an
appropriate type and size of pipe at a driveway crossing.



      C.   Clear Sight Distances. A driveway shall be designed and
located to minimize obstructions to vision by motorists and pedestrians of
other traffic. PennDOT also has sight distance requirements for driveways
entering onto a State road.



      D.   Driveway Setbacks. A new driveway shall be setback a
minimum of 5 feet from a utility pole or fire hydrant.



      E.   Slope and Width. The slope of a driveway shall not exceed
10 percent within 20 feet of a street right-of-way. The slope and width of a
driveway and the clear height above it shall be sufficient to allow access by
emergency vehicles.



      F.   Driveway Grading. Grading shall allow drainage to
continue to gutters, unless an alternative method of drainage is approved.



      G.   Number. A lot shall have a maximum of two points of
vehicle access onto a street, unless specifically approved otherwise by
PennDOT or by the Borough as part of a subdivision or land development.



      H.   Setback. Driveways and parking areas must be located a
minimum of one foot from the side and rear lot line. However, a residential
driveway may be located on the lot if it physically abuts a driveway on the
adjacent lot. This location will only be allowed if agreed to by the owners
of each lot, and such approval is recorded as a shared driveway on a
Borough-approved plan.



   5.   Paving, Grading and Drainage.



      A.   Parking and loading facilities and including driveways
shall be graded and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive water
flow across streets or adjoining properties.



      B.   Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required
parking areas for commercial, industrial, multi-family and institutional uses
involving 4 or more spaces, off-street loading facilities and driveways
serving such uses shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, paving block, or
other low-dust materials pre-approved by the Borough.



         (1)   If a residential driveway is over 100 feet long,
only the first 25 feet is required to have such hard surfaces, while the
remainder may be crushed stone.



         (2)   Driveways limited to use by emergency vehicles are
not required to be paved provided the Fire Company approves the proposed
surface.



         (3)   Driveways and parking that serve public uses,
public parks and public recreation areas are not required to be paved.



         (4)   However, by special exception, the Zoning Hearing
Board may allow parking areas with low or seasonal usage to be maintained in
stone, grass or other suitable surfaces. For example, the Board may allow
parking spaces to be grass, while major aisles are covered by stone.



         (5)   If the design and materials are found to be
acceptable in writing by the Borough Engineer, portions of parking areas may
be covered with a low-dust porous pavement surface that is designed to
promote groundwater recharge.



      C.   Motor vehicles shall not routinely be parked on grass or
dirt surfaces, except where specifically approved under the above provisions.
Entrances to parking spaces shall only occur at lawful driveway locations.



   6.   Lighting of Parking Areas. See "Light and Glare Control" in
Section 27-1007 .



   7.   Parking for Persons With Disabilities.



      A.   Number of Spaces.  See requirements under the Federal
Americans With Disabilities Act for parking for persons with disabilities.

of an individual handicapped parking space in front of a home.



   8.   Paved Area Setbacks (including Off-Street Parking Setbacks).



      A.   Intent. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a
lot do not obstruct sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to
aid in storm water management along streets, and to prevent vehicles from
entering or exiting a lot other than at approved driveways.



      B.   Any new or expanded vehicle parking or vehicle storage
area of 4 or more parking spaces that serves a principal non-residential use
shall be separated from a public street by a planting strip. The planting
strip shall have a minimum width of 8 feet and be maintained in grass or
other attractive vegetative groundcover. The planting strip may be on one or
both sides of any sidewalk, provided the planting width totals 8 feet. This 8
feet width shall be increased to 15 feet for a lot including 30 or more
parking spaces that are visible from the street.



         (1)   The planting strip shall not include heights or
locations of plants that would obstruct safe sight distances, but may include
deciduous trees that allow motorists to maintain views under the leaf canopy.



         (2)   The planting strip may be placed inward from the
shoulder of an uncurbed street or inward from the curb of a curbed street.
The planting strip may overlap the street right-of-way, provided it does not
conflict with PennDOT requirements, and provided that the Borough and PennDOT
as applicable maintain the right to replace planting areas within the
right-of-way with future street improvements.



         (3)   The planting strip may be crossed perpendicularly
by driveways.



         (4)   The planting strip may consist of vegetative
stormwater channels.



         (5)   The following shall be prohibited within the
planting strip:



            (a)   paving, except as allowed by subsection "c."
above, and except for street widenings that may occur after the development
is completed,



            (b)   fences,  and



            (c)   parking, storage or display of vehicles or
manufactured homes or items for sale or rent or junk.



         (6)   Where feasible, where a sidewalk is not installed,
this setback should include an unobstructed generally level width running
parallel to a street that is suitable for a person to walk.



      C.   See landscaping requirements in Article 27-1304.



   9.   Pedestrian Route. If a parking lot serving commercial uses will
include 50 or more new parking spaces, it shall include a designated
pedestrian walkway / wheelchair accessway through the parking lot to at least
one major pedestrian entrance, and with a marked pedestrian crossing across
any major vehicle route.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1104.   Off-Street Loading.



   1.   Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which
meet the requirements of this Section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum
demand generated by the use and the maximum size vehicle, in a manner that
will not routinely obstruct traffic on a public street and traffic entering
and exiting the lot. If no other reasonable alternative is feasible, traffic
may be obstructed for occasional loading and unloading along an alley,
provided traffic has the ability to use another method of access.



   2.   At the time of review under this Ordinance, the applicant shall
provide evidence to the Zoning Officer on whether the use will have
sufficient numbers and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning Commission
and/or Borough Council may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on this
matter as part of any plan review by such boards. For the purposes of this
Section, the words "loading" and "unloading" are used interchangeably.



   3.   Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude
into approved buffer areas and landscaped areas.



   4.   To the maximum extent feasible, tractor-trailer loading docks
shall be designed so that they are buffered from view of dwellings or from
adjacent streets by walls or landscaping. However, areas that are only used
for short-term unloading of trucks and that do not require use of a dock are
not required to be buffered.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1105.   Fire Lanes and Access.



   1.   Fire lanes shall be provided where required by State or Federal
regulations or other local ordinances.



   2.   Access shall be also provided so that fire equipment can reach
all sides of principal non-residential buildings and multi-family/apartment
buildings. This access shall be able to support a loaded fire pumper truck,
but shall not necessarily be paved.



   3.   The specific locations of fire lanes and fire equipment access
are subject to approval by the Borough, after review by Borough Fire
Officials.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



Part 12
Signs



§ 27-1201.   Purposes and Applicability.



   1.   Purposes. This Part is intended to: promote and maintain
overall community aesthetic quality; establish reasonable time, place and
manner of regulations for the exercise of free speech, without regulating
content (excepting obscenity that is prohibited by State law or language that
incites violence); promote traffic safety by avoiding distractions and sight
distance obstructions; and protect property values and ensure compatibility
with the character of neighboring uses.



   2.   Permit Required. A zoning permit shall be required for all
signs except for:  a) signs meeting the requirements of Section 27-1203 ,
and b) non-illuminated window signs. Only types, sizes and heights of signs
that are specifically permitted by this Part within the applicable District
shall be allowed.



   3.   Changes on Signs. Any lawfully existing sign (including
non-conforming signs) may be painted or repaired or changed in logo or
message or replaced with a new sign face without needing a zoning permit,
provided that the changes do not increase the sign area or height or
otherwise result in noncompliance or an increased non-conformity with this
Ordinance.  See also Section 27-1212 concerning non-conforming signs. A
change to a digital sign shall need a zoning permit.



   4.   Fees. Through a resolution by Borough Council, the Borough may
establish permit fees and license fees for various types of signs.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)

may also project over part of a sidewalk if it complies with the applicable
requirements of the Construction Code, including  minimum clearance above

   3.   Maximum Height of Wall Signs. The maximum height of wall signs
shall be equal to the top of the roof along the wall to which they are

extends up to 10 feet above the structural roof, provided the parapet roof
appears to be an architectural extension of the building.



   4.   Portable Signs (Including "Signs on Mobile Stands") and Other
Temporary Signs.



      A.   Purpose. These standards recognize portable signs as a
particular type of sign that has the characteristics of a temporary sign but
that has been inappropriately used as a permanent sign. This Section is based
on the policy that if a use desires to regularly display a sign for regularly
changing messages, that it erect a permanent sign within all of the
requirements of this Ordinance.



      B.   Portable signs are prohibited in all Districts, except as
a temporary Charitable Event sign  permitted by Section 27-1203.







   The sign to the right is an example of a prohibited portable sign.



      C.   Businesses are encouraged to provide an area on a
permanent sign that displays changeable messages, as opposed to using a
separate sign for such purpose.



   4.   Signs on Freestanding Walls. An allowed freestanding sign face
may be attached to a decorative masonry or stone wall with a maximum height
of 6 feet and a maximum length of 12 feet, without being regulated by the
wall setback regulations of this Ordinance and without the entire wall
counting as sign area. Such walls may be placed in a yard, provided they do
not obstruct safe sight distances.



   5.   Major Development Sign. One two-sided sign or two one-sided
signs shall be allowed at up to 2 exterior street entrances to a subdivision
or land development of 20 or more dwelling units or more than 5 principal
business uses. Such sign area shall be a maximum of 40 square feet and may be
attached to a wall that meets Section 27-1204 .4. If a development includes 5
to 19 dwelling units, a similar sign with a maximum of 16 square feet shall
be allowed. Such signs shall not be illuminated, and shall have a maximum
total height of 10 feet above the ground.







   The sign to the right is an example of a Major Development Sign that is
not illuminated.



   6.   Landscaping Around a New Freestanding Sign.  When a new
freestanding sign is proposed with a sign area of 20 square feet or greater,
other than a replacement of an existing sign, a landscaped area shall be
provided around the sign.  Such landscaped area shall be equal or greater in
length than the horizontal length of the sign, and shall have a minimum width
of 5 feet.  Such landscaped area shall be comprised of vegetative ground
cover, which may include shrubs, and it may be crossed by a sidewalk. 
Curbing or a similar barrier should be used as needed to prevent vehicles
from hitting the sign.

electronically moving images.



         (1)   In addition, flashing lights visible from a street
shall not be used to attract attention to a business. This restriction
specifically includes window signs, but does not prohibit Christmas-season

      C.   Signs which emit smoke, visible vapors or particles,
sound or odor are prohibited.



      D.   Signs which contain information that states that a lot
may be used for a purpose not permitted under this Ordinance are prohibited.



      E.   Signs that are of such form, shape or color that they

if there is an electronically changing sign area of greater than 50 square
feet, the sign shall not change its message more frequently than once every
20 seconds. This provision on sign timing shall not regulate signs that are
not readable from a public street and that are not readable from any dwelling.

§ 27-1206.   Off-Premise Signs (Including Billboards).



   1.   Purposes. Off-premise signs are controlled by this Ordinance
for the following purposes, to:  ensure that a physical environment is
maintained that is attractive to desirable types of development; prevent
visual pollution in the Borough and protect property values, especially in
consideration of the fact that most commercial areas of the Borough are
within close proximity to existing residences; prevent glare on adjacent
property and streets; avoid the creation of additional visual distractions to
motorists, especially along busy arterial streets that involve complex
turning movements and numerous traffic hazards; recognize the numerous
alternative forms of free speech available in the Borough, including existing
nonconforming off-premise signs, on-premise signs and temporary signs and
printed and electronic media; carry out the purposes listed in Section
27-1201.



   2.   Nonconforming Off-Premise Signs. This section is not intended
to require the removal of an existing lawfully-placed off-premise sign that

Myerstown are permitted by right in all Districts.  Such signs may include
official directional signs to destinations.

of sign area shall be separated by a minimum of 500 feet from any other
off-premise sign with a sign area greater than 50 square feet, including
signs on either side of a street and including existing signs in other
municipalities.



      E.   Maximum Height. 40 feet above the elevation of the street
or highway that the sign face is directed towards, measured at the street
centerline. The bottom of such sign shall be elevated a minimum of 10 feet
above the ground and be designed to be resistant to climbing by unauthorized
persons.



      F.   Control of Lighting and Glare. See Sections 27-1007 .20
and 27-1205 .2. Lights shall be directed so they do not shine into the eyes
of motorists nor residents of homes. Lighting shall be directed downwards
towards the sign area and shall be turned off between the hours of midnight
and 6 a.m.



      G.   Setbacks. No off-premise sign greater than 50 square feet
in sign area shall be located within 200 feet from the lot line of an
existing principal dwelling.



      H.   Condition. The sign shall be maintained in a good and
safe condition, particularly to avoid hazards in high winds. The area around
the sign shall be kept free of debris. If the message of a sign is no longer
intact, it shall be replaced with a solid color or a "for lease" sign.



      I.   This Ordinance shall not regulate the placement of
"Tourist Oriented Directional Signs," provided the signs are posted along a
public street right-of-way in a manner allowed under PennDOT regulations for
such signs or that are approved by the Borough along a Borough street. (Note
- These are typically blue signs that direct motorists to various major
destinations.)

   6.   Construction of Signs. Every sign permitted in this section
(other than temporary and window signs) shall be constructed of durable
materials and shall be kept in good condition and repair. The Zoning Officer

be subject to all of the requirements for freestanding signs in the District
in which such vehicle, trailer or structure is located.

lot which directly abuts a public street, a street proposed to be dedicated
to the Borough by the subdivision plan which created or creates such lot, or
a private street which meets all of the requirements of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance. This requirement for frontage shall not be met by
an "alley," except that a lot with frontage onto a street may be approved to
have its vehicle access onto an alley, if the alley has suitable access to
the street.



      A.   In the case of townhouses, manufactured/mobile home park,
or apartments, each unit may have access onto a parking court which then has
access onto a public or private street meeting Borough standards, provided

      A.   A lot may include more than one permitted principal use
per lot and/or more than one permitted principal building per lot, provided
that all of the requirements are met for each use and each building. If
differing dimensional requirements apply for different uses on the lot, then
the most restrictive requirement shall apply.



         (1)   For example, if Use One requires a 10,000 square
feet lot area and Use Two on the same lot requires a 20,000 square feet lot
area, then the lot shall have a minimum lot area of 20,000 square feet.



         (2)   The applicant shall submit a site plan that
demonstrates that each structure would meet the requirements of this
Ordinance.



         (3)   The uses and buildings shall be in common
ownership. However, a condominium form of ownership of individual buildings,
with a legally binding property-owners association, may be established if the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon review
by the Borough Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in
place.



      B.   A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential
development or apartment development may include more than one principal
building per lot, provided all other requirements of this Ordinance are met.
A condominium form of ownership of individual dwelling units, with a legally
binding homeowners association, may be established if the applicant proves to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough
Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in place and
compliance with applicable State law.



   3.   Minimum Size of Dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a
minimum of 500 square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor and heated floor
area, which shall be primarily above the ground level.  This 500 square
footage may be reduced to 400 square feet for each dwelling unit that is
permanently legally restricted to occupancy by at least one person age 55 and
older, with no residents under age 18.



   4.   Maximum Occupancy. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied on
a lot for more than 10 days in a calendar year, except as may be approved
within a campground. A mobile/manufactured home shall not be occupied on a
lot as a dwelling unless it meets all of the requirements for a dwelling. A
mobile/ manufactured home shall not be used as a storage building, except as
may be allowed temporarily during on-site construction under a Borough
construction permit.

§ 27-1302.   Height Exceptions.



   See Section 27-502.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1303.   Special Lot and Yard Requirements, Sight Distance and Buffer
Yards.



   1.   In General.



      A.   No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in
such a way that it would result in another lot, building or use not being
able to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. This includes, but is not
limited to: setback areas, non-impervious areas and off-street parking areas.



      B.   Emergency Access. All uses and structures shall have
adequate provisions for access by emergency vehicles and fire ladders. See
also the Uniform Construction Code Appendices. Such access shall be
maintained in a passable condition by the owner of the lot, or where
applicable by the property-owner association.



   2.   Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas, Lot Widths and Yards.



      A.   Corner Lots. For a corner lot, each yard that abuts a
public street shall be considered a front yard and meet the requirements for
minimum depth of a front yard. See definition of "Lot, Corner" in Section
27-1502 .



      B.   Projections Into Required Yards.



         (1)   Cornices, footers, eaves, roof overhangs, sills or
other similar architectural features, exterior stairways, unenclosed fire
escapes or other required means of egress, rain leads, chimneys, slanted
exterior doors for basement access, window awnings, chaise for heating pipes
or other similar structures that do not include space usable by persons may
extend or project into a required yard not more than 3 feet.



         (2)   Exterior steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped
ramps, and landings necessary to provide entrance to a building may be
located within a required setback area.



         (3)   For decks and porches, see Part 5.



      C.   Lot Widths Around Curves. Around the bulb of a cul-de-sac
street or on the outside of the curve of a street with a radius of less than
150 feet, the minimum lot width at the minimum required building setback line
may be reduced to 60 percent of the width that would otherwise be required.



      D.   Front Yards. See Section 27-504 .3, which may allow a
reduced front yard where adjacent buildings have smaller existing front yards.



   3.   Sight Clearance at Intersections.  At the intersection of two
streets, a clear sight triangle shall be provided. Within this triangle, no
visual obstructions shall be allowed between the height of 3 feet and 10 feet
above the ground level, except for fences that are almost entirely
transparent fences (such as chain link), utility posts, mailboxes, single
sign posts less than one foot in diameter and the trunks of canopy trees.
Re-grading shall also not reduce visibility within the sight clearance
triangle. The triangle shall be measured along the centerline of the streets.
Each leg of the triangle shall be measured 75 feet from the intersection of
the centerlines of the travel lanes of a local or collector street and 150
feet along an arterial street. A third longer leg shall connect the ends of
the two legs to form the triangle.







      A.   However, in place of the above sight triangle, where a
local street intersects a collector or arterial street with a stop sign only
at the local street, the leg of the triangle along the collector or arterial
street in each direction shall be increased to 250 feet and the leg along the
local street shall be decreased to 20 feet back from the edge of the
intersecting travel lane.



      B.   The clear sight triangle shall be kept free of such
obstructions in perpetuity.



      C.   Where an alley intersects with a street, a clear sight
triangle shall be required that is 15 feet along the closest cartway of a
street and 10 feet long along the centerline of the alley.  Where an alley
intersects with another alley, a clear sight triangle shall be required that
is 10 feet long along the centerlines of both alleys. For example, this sight
triangle may require that a rear garage be setback from a corner or that a
solid fence be angled near the intersection to avoid intruding into the sight
triangle.



      D.   For driveway sight clearance, see Section 27-1103.4.



   4.   Buffers and Planting Screening.  Buffer yards including plant
screening complying with the following standards shall be required under the
following situations, unless a more restrictive provision is established by
another section of this Ordinance:



      A.   A minimum 8 feet wide buffer yard with plant screening
shall be required along the rear and side lot lines of any lot that is
developed for a new principal building or principal parking lot and that is
contiguous to a lot line of a residentially zoned lot occupied by an existing
principal dwelling. If the lots are separated by a street or an alley open to
traffic, the lots shall not be considered to be contiguous.



         (1)   If a principal business use will include areas
used for manufacturing or will have a loading dock that will be routinely
serviced by two or more tractor-trailer trucks or refrigerated trucks, then
the minimum buffer yard width along such manufacturing area and/or loading
dock shall be increased to 20 feet, and the minimum initial height of
plantings shall be increased to 5 feet.



         (2)   The presence of a dwelling on the same lot as a
principal business use shall not by itself require the provision of a buffer
yard.



         (3)   Where a buffer yard will be located along a
street, it shall be designed with a mix of vegetation that allows views at a
5 to 6 feet eye level into the site, for security purposes.



         (4)   A Buffer Yard is also required to be provided by
the following if they are abutting and visible from a public street or alley:



            (a)   Along lot lines and street or alley
rights-of-way of any newly developed or expanded outdoor industrial storage
or loading area, or



            (b)   Along lot lines and street or alley
rights-of-way of any newly developed or expanded area routinely used for the
overnight parking of 2 or more tractor-trailer trucks or trailers of
tractor-trailers.



         (5)   A lot in the TC district is not required to
provide a buffer yard.



      B.   A required yard may overlap a required buffer yard,
provided the requirement for each is met. The buffer yard shall be measured
from the District boundary line, street right-of-way line or lot line,
whichever is applicable. Required plantings shall not be placed within the
right-of-way, except that the Borough may allow deciduous canopy trees.



      C.   The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of
structures, dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display, signs,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and unloading areas
or vehicle parking or display.



      D.   Fence. The Borough may require the installation of a
mostly solid decorative fence in addition to the plantings. Any wall or fence
in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside (non-residential side) of any
required plant screening. If a fence in a buffer yard has one side that is
more finished or smoother than the other side, the more finished or smoother
side shall face the outside of the buffer yard.



      E.   Each planting screen shall meet the following
requirements:



         (1)   Plant materials needed to form the visual screen
shall have a minimum height when planted of 4 feet. In addition, an average
of one deciduous shade tree, with a minimum trunk diameter of 2 inches
measured 6 inches above the finished ground level, shall be placed for each
50 feet of length of the buffer yard. The shade trees may be clustered or
spaced unevenly.



         (2)   Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be
of such species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to produce
within 3 years a mostly solid year-round visual screen at least 6 feet in
height, except where views into a site from a street are needed for security
purposes, in which case the screen should have a trimmed height of less than
5 feet.







         (3)   The plant screen shall be placed so that at
maturity the plants will not obstruct a street or sidewalk.



         (4)   The plant visual screen shall extend the full
length of the lot line, except for:  a) Borough-approved points of
approximately perpendicular vehicle or pedestrian ingress and egress to the
lot, b) locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance requirements
where the plantings cannot feasibly be moved further back, and c) locations
needed to meet other specific State, Borough and utility requirements, such
as stormwater swales.



         (5)   Weak-stem plants shall not be used to meet the
buffer yard requirements. A monotonous straight row of the same species is
discouraged. A more naturalistic form of planting is encouraged with a mix of
species. If more than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no more than 50
percent shall be of one species.



         (6)   Evergreen trees should be planted at diagonal
off-sets so that there is room for future growth of the trees.



         (7)   The plant screening shall primarily use evergreen
trees.



         (8)   Modifications. The Zoning Officer may also modify
the buffer yard requirements if necessary for fire safety reasons. The Zoning
Hearing Board may by special exception reduce the width of the buffer yard
and/or modify other provisions of this Section 27-1303 .4 if the requirements
cannot be feasibly met or if the applicant proposes an alternative that would
serve the same effect.



      F.   Buffer Yard Plans.



         (1)   Prior to the issuance of a permit under this
Ordinance where a buffer yard would be required, and on any required
subdivision or land development plan, the applicant shall submit plans
showing:



            (a)   the location and arrangement of each buffer
yard,



            (b)   the placement, general selection of species
and initial size of all plant materials, and



            (c)   the placement, size, materials and type of
all fences to be placed in such buffer yard.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1304.   Landscaping.



   1.   A minimum of 10 percent of each lot shall be landscaped in
trees, shrubs and vegetative ground cover. The 10 percent shall be reduced to
5 percent for a lot in the TC district. Within a subdivision or land
development, such 10 percent shall apply to the entire project, but does not
need to be met for each lot, provided that the plan includes standards for
each lot to assure compliance with the overall requirement. See also the
buffer yard provisions in Section 27-1303.



      A.   Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or
apartment lot which is not used for structures, loading areas, parking spaces
and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be provided with an
all-season, well-maintained vegetative groundcover, and shall be landscaped
with trees and shrubs.



      B.   Landscaped areas shall be kept free of junk, debris,
rubbish and noxious weeds.



      C.   The percent landscaping requirement may be partly met by
landscaped areas placed within a portion of a public right-of-way if approved
by the Borough. For example, if there is a wide right-of-way that is not
entirely needed for a sidewalk, plantings may be approved between the
sidewalk and a right-of-way line.



   2.   Parking Lot Trees. For each 10 new off-street parking spaces,
one new deciduous shade tree shall be planted that meets the street tree
requirements of Section 4. below.



   3.   Landscape Maintenance. All trees and other landscaping required
by this Ordinance or the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance shall be
perpetually maintained by the property-owner. If any landscaping that is
needed to meet an Ordinance requirement dies, is removed, or is severely
damaged, it shall be replaced by the current property-owner, within a maximum
of 180 days. Note - In certain cases the developer will be responsible for
replacement within an initial time period under a subdivision requirement.



   4.   Street Trees. Where a street tree is required to be planted by
the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, the provisions of that
Ordinance shall apply to the street trees instead of this Subsection "4."
Street trees shall be required when a new principal non-residential or
multi-family apartment building is proposed, or along a new street or an
extension of an existing street. Street trees are not required where the
Borough determines that existing healthy trees proposed to be preserved will
serve the same function.



      A.   The Zoning Officer may approve other species of trees
than those listed below if the applicant provides written evidence to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that the trees would be sturdy, attractive
and resistant to disease and road salt.



      B.   A tree required by this Section shall be of the following
species. This list shall not regulate types of trees that are not required to
be planted by this Ordinance.

      C.   If more than 10 trees are required to be planted, then no
more than 50 percent shall be of one species.



      D.   Quality of Trees.  Trees shall be of symmetrical growth,
free of insect pests and disease and durable under the maintenance
contemplated.  The developer shall water trees as needed until a property is

(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1305.   Non-conformities.



   1.   Proof and Registration of Non-conformities. It shall be the
responsibility of, with the burden of proof upon, a party asserting a
non-conformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner
may request a written statement of non-conformity from the Zoning Officer
after providing sufficient evidence.



   2.   Continuation of Non-conformities.



      A.   A lawful non-conforming use, structure or lot as defined
by this Ordinance may be continued and may be sold and continued by new
owners.



      B.   Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
non- conformity shall only occur in conformance with this section.



      C.   If an existing use was not lawfully established, it shall
not have any right to continue as a non-conforming use.



   3.   Expansion of or Construction Involving Non-conformities. The
following shall apply, unless the structure is approved under Section 27-1305
.4.



      A.   Non-conforming Structure.



         (1)   The Zoning Officer shall permit a non-conforming
structure to be reconstructed or expanded provided:



            (a)   that such action will not increase the
severity or amount of the non-conformity (such as the area of the building
extending into the required yard) or create any new non-conformity, or



            (b)   that any expanded area will comply with the
applicable setbacks in that District and other requirements of this
Ordinance, unless allowed otherwise by this section.



         (2)   In the case of a non-conforming structure which is
used by a non-conforming use, any expansion shall also meet the requirements
of this Section regarding non-conforming uses.



      B.   Non-conforming Lots.



         (1)   Permitted Construction on a Non-conforming Lot. A
single permitted by right principal use and its customary accessory uses may
be constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a non-conforming lot provided
all of the following additional requirements are met:



            (a)   The lot must be a lawful non-conforming lot
of record;



            (b)   Minimum setback requirements shall be met,
except as is allowed in subsection "(3)" below;



            (c)   State and Federal wetland regulations shall
be met; and



            (d)   If a septic or well is used, the
requirements for such shall be met.



         (2)   Lot Width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of
record does not meet the minimum lot width requirements of this Ordinance
shall not by itself cause such lot to be considered to be a non-conforming
lot.



         (3)   Reduction of Side Yards. On an existing lawful lot
with a non-conforming width, as a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board
may approve a reduction of up to 50 percent in each side setback if the
applicant proves such reduction is necessary to allow a customary addition to
an existing dwelling, a replacement of an existing undersized dwelling with a
new dwelling, or to avoid the construction of a new dwelling that would be
inconsistent with the building width of adjacent dwellings. This subsection
shall not allow a reduction in setback to increase the number of dwelling
units on the lot, except for a Unit for Care of Relative.



         (4)   Expansion Along a Nonconforming Setback. Where
part of an existing one family dwelling (including a townhouse) has a side
yard that is smaller than would normally be required, other parts of that
dwelling may be expanded along that same side, provided that the building
extension does not go beyond the side setback that already exists along that
side.



      C.   Expansion of a Non-conforming Non-Residential Use. A
non-conforming use or a building used by a non-conforming use shall only be
expanded if there is compliance with the following provisions:



         (1)   An expansion of more than 5 percent in total
building floor area shall require special exception approval from the Zoning
Hearing Board under Section 27-1411.4.d.



         (2)   Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only
upon the same lot that the non-conforming use was located upon at the time
the use became non- conforming.



         (3)   The 1) total building floor area used by a
non-conforming use or the 2) total land area covered by the non-conforming
use, whichever is more restrictive, shall not be increased by greater than 50
percent beyond what existed in the non-conforming use at the time the use
first became non-conforming.



            (a)   The above maximum increase shall be measured
in aggregate over the entire life of the non-conformity. All expansions of
the non-conforming use and/or building(s) that occurred since the use
originally became non-conforming shall count towards the above maximum
increase.



         (4)   Any expansion of a non-conforming use shall meet
the required setbacks and other requirements of this Ordinance, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.



      D.   Expansion of a Non-conforming Residential Use. An
existing non- conforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted by
right use provided that:  a) the number of dwelling units or rooming house
units are not increased, b) the expansion meets all applicable setbacks, c)
no new types of non-conformities are created and d) a non-conformity is not
made more severe.



      E.   Non-conforming Sign. The provisions of this Ordinance
shall not provide a right to expand or extend a non-conforming sign. Instead,
any expansions or extensions of a non-conforming sign shall comply with this
Ordinance. See also Section 27-1212 .



   4.   Damaged or Destroyed Non-conformities. A non-conforming
structure or non-conforming use that has been destroyed or damaged may be
rebuilt in a non- conforming fashion only if:  a) the application for a
building permit is submitted within 12 months after the date of damage or
destruction, b) work begins in earnest within 12 months after the building
permit is issued and continues, and c) no non-conformity may be newly created
or increased by any reconstruction. The property shall be properly secured
during such time in such a way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to
neighboring properties.



   5.   Abandonment of a Non-conformity.



      A.   If a non-conforming use of a building or land is
discontinued, razed, removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent
use of such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
District in which it is located, except as provided for in the "Damaged or
Destroyed Non-conformities" provisions of this section in subsection 4. above.



      B.   The applicant shall be responsible to provide clear and
convincing evidence that the non-conformity was not abandoned.



      C.   An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented
for any period of time without being considered "abandoned" under this
Ordinance.



   6.   Changes from One Non-conforming Use to Another.



      A.   Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land
shall not revert to a non-conforming use.



      B.   A non-conforming use may be changed to a different
non-conforming use only if approved as a Special Exception by the Zoning
Hearing Board. However, Special Exception approval is not needed for a simple
change within an existing building from one lawful non-conforming retail
store use to another retail store use or from one lawful non-conforming
personal service use to another personal service use, provided that the new
use complies with any Zoning Hearing Board conditions that applied to the
previous use and is not more objectionable in external effects than the
previous use.



      C.   Where special exception approval is required for a change
of a non-conforming use, the Board shall determine whether the applicant has
provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed new use will be equal or
less objectionable in external effects than the pre-existing non-conforming
use with regard to:



         (1)   Traffic safety and generation (especially truck
traffic),



         (2)   Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare,
vibration, fire, hazardous substances, and explosive hazards,



         (3)   Amount and character of outdoor storage,



         (4)   Hours of operation if the use would be close to
dwellings and



         (5)   Compatibility with the character of the
surrounding area.



      D.   A non-conforming use shall not be changed to a
non-conforming Adult Use.



   7.   District Changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
non-conforming because of a Zoning District change shall be regulated under
this Section on non- conformities.



   8.   Voluntary Replacement of a Non-conforming Structure. A
non-conforming structure may be partially or completely replaced with a new
non-conforming structure if the following requirements are all met:



      A.   A building permit shall be issued within a maximum of 6
months after the building is demolished; and



      B.   A new non-conformity shall not be created and any
existing non- conformity shall not be made more serious or increased. For
example, a vehicle garage with a non-conforming setback may be replaced with
a new garage with the same setback on the same side.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1306.   Dumpster Screening and Location.



   1.   Site plans submitted to the Borough shall show the proposed
location of any garbage dumpsters. The Zoning Officer may require that such
proposed location be modified to provide compatibility with nearby dwellings,
such as to maintain a minimum 70 feet setback from any dwelling.



   2.   The Borough Staff may issue a permit to place a temporary
dumpster within a street right-of-way where necessary for on-site work,
provided such dumpster does not obstruct traffic or safe sight distances.  A
maximum time period shall be established on the permit.



   3.   If a garbage dumpster is not stored within a building, then it
shall be screened from view of any public street or dwelling by decorative
masonry wall or weather- resistant solid board fence, with a mostly solid
gate.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1307.   Portable Storage Containers.



   1.   This section shall apply to a portable storage container that
is kept outside of a building and which has a length greater than 10 feet and
which is not currently attached to a motor vehicle or railroad and which is
not part of a permitted industrial use on the same lot.



   2.   The following regulations shall apply on a principally
residential lot:



      A.   A portable storage container shall not be kept on a
principally residential lot for a total of more than 2 months in any 2 year
period, unless it is being used as part of an active construction permit for
the lot.  A temporary zoning permit shall be required if the portable
storage container is kept on the lot for more than 30 days.



      B.   A maximum of one portable storage container shall be
allowed per lot.



   3.   On a lot that is not a principally residential lot, any
portable storage container that is kept on a lot for more than 30 days shall
meet the setbacks that apply to a principal building, unless the container is
necessary to temporarily hold materials for active on-site construction.



   4.   The following shall apply to any portable storage container:



      A.   The container shall not obstruct safe sight distances at
intersections.



      B.   The container shall not obstruct travel lanes of a street
or a public sidewalk, unless specifically authorized by a Borough permit
where there is no alternative.



      C.   The container shall only be allowed to be placed within a
street right-of-way if a permit for such placement is issued by the
Borough.  Such permit shall specify a maximum number of days during which
the container may be placed within the right-of-way.



      D.   The container shall not be used to store hazardous,
explosive or toxic substances or putrescent garbage.



      E.   A facility that stores portable storage containers that
have been leased by others or are available for lease shall be considered a
warehouse.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1308.   Green Incentives.



   1.   See Section 27-505 regarding solar dimensional provisions. That
section allows some flexibility in dimensional requirements.



   2.   See Section 27-502, which allows solar energy collection
devices to exceed the maximum height.



   3.   If a building or parking structure includes an approved "Green
Roof", the area covered by the Green Roof may exceed allowed maximum building
coverage, up to a maximum increase of 20 percent.  For example, if a
District includes a maximum 30 percent building coverage, and a building
footprint equal to 20 percent of the lot is covered by a green building roof,
then the maximum total allowed building coverage shall be 50 percent. In such
example, an area equal to a minimum of 20 percent of the lot area would need
to be covered by a green roof, but not the entire building roof.



      A.   In order to be considered a "Green Roof," such area shall
be exposed to direct sunlight at noon-time and shall be covered with
vegetation that is designed to absorb stormwater runoff. Vegetation shall be
planted in soil or other growing material with a minimum of 4 inches of
depth. Up to 10 percent of an area of a Green Roof may include walkways or
skylights. If such vegetation dies, it shall be required to be replaced
within 150 days.



   4.   Pervious pavement used for vehicle parking and vehicle movement
shall be considered impervious for the purposes of the zoning ordinance
impervious coverage requirement, except as follows.  The maximum impervious
coverage of a lot or a tract may be increased by up to 10 percent of the lot
area if a corresponding land area is covered by Borough-approved pervious
pavement.



      A.   For example, if a lot includes 10,000 square feet, and
has a 50 percent maximum impervious surface requirement, and the lot will
include 1,000 square feet of pervious pavement, then a maximum of 6,000
square feet of the lot may be covered by impervious surfaces instead of 5,000
square feet. In such example, 5,000 square feet of the lot could be covered
with building roofs and paving surfaces that are impervious.



   5.   This subsection "5." applies if the applicant proves that a new
building will be "Certified" or meets a higher standard under the published
standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
Certified building, following the latest published standards of the U.S.
Green Building Council or its successor entity for New Construction or
Building Rehabilitation.  In such case, the Certified building may exceed
maximum building coverage and/or the maximum impervious coverage by 10
percent for the lot.  This incentive may not be added on top of the other
building and impervious incentives in this Section. 



      A.   The applicant is required to have a LEED-certified
professional provide a statement in writing to the Borough at each of the
following times:  a) the land development application, b) at the time of the
building permit application and c) at a point half-way through
construction.  Such statement shall provide a professional opinion that the
project will be able to meet the LEED Certification, and specifying the point
system that will be used. 



      B.   If a building fails to meet the requirements for LEED
Certification after occupancy, the Zoning Officer shall have the authority to
require that the current building owner make sufficient changes to the
building and submittals to obtain the intended certification.



   6.   Applicants are encouraged to provide an electric recharging
station for electric motor vehicles, particularly if the use involves a total
of 100 or more vehicle parking spaces.  Such electric recharging stations
shall be permitted by right in all Zoning Districts and may take the place of
required parking spaces.

(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1403.   Permits and Certificates.



   1.   Applicability.

         (7)   Construction of a motor vehicle driveway, parking
pad or parking lot.



      B.   Zoning Permit. A Zoning Permit indicates that a zoning
application complies with this Ordinance, to the best knowledge of the
applicable Borough Staff.



         (1)   A Zoning Permit is required to be issued prior to
the start of any of the activities regulated by subsection "1.A." above.



         (2)   The Borough may, at its option, issue combined or
separate Construction Permits and Zoning Permits and/or may utilize a single
or separate applications for such permits.



         (3)   Both principal and accessory uses and structures
shall need a zoning permit, except that the Borough may not require an
individual zoning permit for accessory uses that are customarily incidental
to a principal use that has received a zoning permit.



      C.   Certificate of Occupancy.



         (1)   Prior to occupancy of a new or expanded building,
a Certificate of Occupancy may be required under the Uniform Construction
Codes (UCC), which are separate requirements under State law.



         (2)   The Borough Staff may require that a Certificate
of Occupancy be delayed or that only a temporary Certificate of Occupancy be
issued if there are outstanding zoning or other ordinance compliance issues.



         (3)   In addition, a Certificate of Occupancy shall be
required to be obtained from the Borough Staff whenever there is a change in
the type of use of a property. 



   2.   Repairs and Maintenance. Ordinary repairs and maintenance to
existing structures that do not involve an expansion or change of a use or
structure shall not by itself be regulated by this Ordinance. Examples of
such work include replacement of a roof or porch that does not involve
enclosure of space. (However, a Construction Permit under Construction Codes
may be needed for such work.)



   3.   Types of Uses.



      A.   Permitted by Right Uses. The Zoning Officer shall issue a
permit under this Ordinance in response to an application for a use that is
"permitted by right" if it meets all of the requirements of this Ordinance.



      B.   Special Exception Use. A permit under this Ordinance for
a use requiring a Special Exception shall be issued by the Zoning Officer
only in response to a written approval by the Zoning Hearing Board following
a hearing.



      C.   Conditional Use. A use requiring zoning approval by the
Borough Council under Section 27-1417 .



   4.   Applications.



      A.   Submittal. All applications for a Zoning Permit or a

provided by the Borough. Such completed application, with required fees,
shall be submitted to a designated Borough staff-person.



      B.   Site Plan. The applicant shall submit a minimum of 2
copies of a site plan with the application if the application involves a new
building, expansion of a building or addition of 3 or more parking spaces.
The site plan shall be drawn to scale and show the following:



         (1)   locations, dimensions and uses of existing and
proposed structures, parking and loading areas, and locations of existing and
proposed uses of areas of land, with existing features clearly distinguished
from proposed features,



         (2)   notes showing the dimensions of all buildings from
lot lines and street rights-of-way,



         (3)   locations of any watercourses and any 100 year

      C.   Additional Information. Any application under this
Ordinance shall include the following information, unless the Zoning Officer
determines such information is unnecessary to determine compliance with this
Ordinance:



         (1)   the address of the lot,



         (2)   name and address of the applicant, and of the
owner of the property if different from the applicant,



         (3)   if the applicant is not the landowner of record,
information shall be presented with the application, such as  an agreement
of sale or lease or a signed letter from the landowner, to demonstrate that
the applicant has the legal right to make the application,



         (4)   a description of the existing and proposed use(s)
of the property, with the proposed use described in sufficient detail for the
Zoning Officer to determine compliance with this Ordinance, 



         (5)   all other applicable information listed on the
official Borough application form,



         (6)   if the applicant is incorporated, the legal name
and day telephone number and email address of at least one primary officer of
the organization/corporation,



         (7)   such additional information that the Zoning
Officer may determine is reasonably necessary to determine compliance with
this Ordinance,



         (8)   a listing of all conditional uses, special
exception approvals and/or variances which the applicant is requesting,
and/or a description with a date of any such relevant approvals that were
previously granted for the property, and



         (9)   signed acknowledgment of the application by the
applicant.



      D.   Submittals to the Board. In addition to the information
listed in parts "(2)" and "(3)" above, an application requiring a site plan
and action by the Zoning Hearing Board or conditional use shall also include
the following information, unless the Zoning Officer determines that such
information is unnecessary to determine compliance with this Ordinance:



         (1)    the present Zoning District and major applicable
lot requirements,



         (2)   for a non-residential use:



            (a)   a description of the proposed
non-residential operations and storage in sufficient detail to indicate
potential nuisances and hazards regarding noise, large truck traffic, glare,
odors, dust, fire or toxic or explosive hazards or other significant public
health and safety hazards,



            (b)   a list of the maximum hours of operation,



         (3)   a listing of any sections of this Ordinance for
which a variance is being requested, with the reasons for such request,

         (5)   information on proposed exterior lighting, 



         (6)   name and address of person who prepared the site
plan, and



         (7)   such additional information required under
applicable sections of this Ordinance.



      E.   Ownership. No person other than a "landowner" or their
specifically authorized agent or a tenant or lessee with written authority or
permission of the landowner shall submit a zoning application (see definition
of "landowner" in Part 15, which includes an equitable owner).



      F.   Site Plan Review. If the Zoning Officer determines that
an application will have significant impacts upon surrounding properties or
will involve complex site plan matters, the Zoning Officer may offer the Site
Plan for review by the Planning Commission and/or Borough Council. In such
case, the applicant may be required to submit additional copies of the site
plan to the Zoning Officer in advance of the meeting. The Council or Planning
Commission may provide advice to the Zoning Officer concerning ordinance
matters, as well as advisory comments to the applicant.



         (1)   This process is designed for situations when a
Land Development Plan will not be required under the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, or when zoning approval matters are intended to be
addressed prior to the Land Development Plan submittal.



   5.   Issuance of Permits.



      A.   The zoning permit and construction permit are two
separate processes under two different sets of regulations. The issuance of
one permit does not relieve an applicant of the requirement to obtain the
other permit.  Any zoning permit is issued with an automatic condition that
the applicant must also meet all applicable Construction Codes.



      B.   At least one copy of each zoning permit application and
any other zoning approval shall be retained in Borough files.



      C.   PennDOT Permit. Where necessary for access onto a State
road or work within a State right-of-way, a Borough zoning permit shall be
automatically conditioned upon issuance of a PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit.



      D.   The Borough may delay the final issuance of a
Construction or Occupancy Permit until a required PennDOT Highway Occupancy
Permit has been issued, any required subdivision and land development
approval has been obtained, a new lot has been recorded, and/or erosion and
sedimentation control approvals have been obtained.



      E.   Compliance with Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance (SALDO).  If an application under this Ordinance would also be
regulated by the SALDO, then any permit or approval under this Zoning
Ordinance shall automatically be conditioned upon compliance with the SALDO.
See the definitions of "Land Development" and "Subdivision" in the SALDO.



   6.   Revocation of Permits; Appeal of Permit or Approval.



      A.   Revocation. The Zoning Officer shall revoke, withhold or
suspend a permit or approval issued under the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in case of one or more of the following:



         (1)   a material false statement or misrepresentation of
fact in the application or on the plans on which the permit or approval was
based;  (Note: The Pennsylvania Criminal Code provides for penalties for
providing false information to a municipal employee in the carrying out of
his/her duties.)



         (2)   upon violation of any condition lawfully imposed a
special exception use approval, conditional use approval, variance or
subdivision or land development approval;



         (3)   any work being accomplished or use of land or a
structure in such a way that does not comply with this Ordinance or an
approved site plan or approved permit application; and/or



         (4)   for any other just cause set forth in this
Ordinance.



      B.   Appeals. A party with legitimate standing, or as
otherwise provided by State law, may appeal decisions and determinations
under this Ordinance within the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (MPC), provided that the time periods for such appeals in the
MPC are met. (As of the adoption date of this Ordinance, such provisions were
primarily in Sections 914.1 and 1002.A.).



   7.   Zoning Permit for Temporary Uses and Structures.



      A.   Temporary Uses.



         (1)   A Zoning Permit for a temporary use or structure
may be issued for customary, routine and accessory short-term special events,
provided that:



            (a)   Only an established nonprofit organization,
governmental agency or a permitted place of worship proposing a temporary use
to clearly primarily serve a charitable, public service or religious purpose
or a Borough-sponsored festival or Borough-sponsored special event shall be
eligible to receive approval for commercial-type activities in a District
where a commercial use would not otherwise be permitted;



            (b)   Such total events in a residential district
shall each be limited to a maximum of 10 total days per calendar year (except
for activities sponsored by the Borough of Myerstown); and



            (c)   The Zoning Officer may require that the
applicant prove that sufficient parking, sanitary facilities, emergency
access, refuse collection, and traffic control will be available for the
special event.



         (2)   A Zoning Permit may be issued for temporary
storage and office trailers that are necessary to serve on-site construction,
while such construction is actively underway under a valid Borough permit.



         (3)   In addition, Christmas Tree sales shall be allowed
by right in Commercial and Industrial Districts, and on property owned by the
Borough with permission of the Borough.



         (4)   The Borough may also approve the construction of a
model home, which is used as a sales office in a development, provided the
building is converted to a dwelling when the development is complete.
Alternatively, a modular sales office may be allowed by the Borough, provided
it is removed completely when the development is complete.



         (5)   Portable Storage Containers - See Section 27-1307.



         (6)   Tents shall meet setbacks that apply to accessory
uses and shall not obstruct safe sight distances.



            (a)   Tents within commercial districts are
permitted to be erected for no longer than 60 total days per calendar year.



            (b)   Tents within non-commercial districts are
permitted to be erected for no more than 20 total days per calendar year.



         (7)   Accessory Retail Sales of the following items that
were grown by a resident of the same property are allowed in any district:
fruits (and their juices), vegetables (and their juices), flowers, plants,
herbs and spices.



         (8)   Garage sales are allowed as provided in Article
1347.



      B.   Time Period. The Zoning Officer shall state a reasonable

date of this Ordinance, these provisions were primarily in Sections 616.1,
617 and 617.2 of such Act.)



   1.   Violations. Any person who shall commit or who shall permit any
of the following actions violates this Ordinance:



      A.   Failure to secure a zoning permit prior to any of the

Borough Council in granting a conditional use or other approval; or



      F.   Violation of any condition imposed by a decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction, where such court has granted zoning approval
with conditions.



   2.   Enforcement Notice. If the Borough has reason to believe that a
violation of a provision of the Zoning Ordinance has occurred, the Borough
shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement notice as
provided in Section 616.1 of the MPC. Prior to sending an official
enforcement notice, the Zoning Officer may at his/her option informally
request compliance.



   3.   Time Limits. An official enforcement notice shall state the
deadline to complete bringing the property into compliance with this
Ordinance, and shall state that the applicant has 30 days from the receipt of
the notice to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The denial of a conditional

the reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date
of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless a Magisterial District Judge who determined that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person
violating this Ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation,
in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation
until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by
the Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney's fees collected for the violation of this Ordinance
shall be paid over to the Borough for the general use of the Borough.
Imprisonment is not authorized under this Ordinance.



      B.   Remedies. In case any building, structure, sign or
landscaping is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired,
converted or maintained; or any building, structure, sign or land is used; or
any hedge, shrub, tree or other growth is maintained in violation of this
Ordinance or of any of the regulations made pursuant thereto or any of the
permits or certificates of use and occupancy issued under this Ordinance or
any conditions imposed upon the grant of a special exception or variance by
the Zoning Hearing Board or upon the grant of a conditional use, then, in
addition to any other remedies provided by law, any appropriate action or
proceeding may be instituted or taken to prevent or restrain such unlawful
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in
and about such premises.

(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)

appropriated by the Borough Council, the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or

Hearing Board shall be responsible for the following:



      A.   Appeal of a Decision by the Zoning Officer.



         (1)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it
is alleged by an affected person, entity or the Borough Council that the
Zoning Officer has improperly acted under the requirements and procedures of
this Ordinance.



         (2)   See time limitations for appeals in Section
27-1411.5.



      B.   Challenge to the Validity of the Ordinance or Map. The
applicable provisions of the MPC shall apply. (Note:  As of the adoption
date of this Ordinance, these provisions were primarily in Sections 909.1 and

      C.   Variance.



         (1)   The Board shall hear requests for Variances filed
with the Borough Staff in writing on the official Borough application form.
The Borough Planning Commission should be provided with an opportunity to

Board is not required to be delayed to allow for a Planning Commission review.



         (2)   Standards. The Board shall only grant a variance
within the limitations of State law. As of the adoption date of this
Ordinance, the MPC provided that all of the following findings must be made,
where relevant:



            (a)   There are unique physical circumstances or
conditions (including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to
the particular property) and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Ordinance in the neighborhood or District in which the
property is located;



            (b)   Because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and a Variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;



            (c)   Such unnecessary hardship has not been
created by the appellant;



            (d)   The Variance, if authorized, will not alter
the essential character of the neighborhood or District in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare;
and



            (e)   The Variance, if authorized, will represent
the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.



         (3)   In granting any Variance, the Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this Ordinance.



         (4)   A variance runs with the property, and can apply
to future owners of the property. A variance applies in perpetuity, unless it
is limited by a condition of the Zoning Hearing Board. A variance cannot be
transferred to a different property.



      D.   Special Exception. See Section 27-1416 .



         (1)   The Board shall hear and decide requests for all
Special Exceptions filed with the Borough Staff in writing. The Board shall
only permit a special exception that is authorized by this Ordinance.



         (2)   A special exception runs with the property, and
can apply to future owners of the property.



      E.   Persons With Disabilities. After the Zoning Officer
receives a complete written application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant
a special exception allowing modifications to specific requirements of this
Ordinance that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing
Board are required under applicable Federal law to provide a "reasonable
accommodation" to serve persons who the applicant proves have "disabilities"
as defined in and protected by such laws.



         (1)   Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested
in accordance with the U.S. Fair Housing Act Amendments and/or the Americans
with Disabilities Act, as amended.



         (2)   If the applicant is requesting a reasonable
accommodation under the United States Fair Housing Amendments Act or the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the applicant shall identify the disability
which is protected by such statutes, the extent of the modification of the
provisions of this Ordinance necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and
the manner by which the reasonable accommodation requested may be removed
when such person(s) with a protected disability no longer will be present on
the property.



         (3)   Any modification approved under this Section may
be limited to the time period during which the persons with disabilities
occupy or utilize the premises.



      F.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall also hear any other
matters as set forth in the MPC. (Note:  As of the adoption date of this
Ordinance, such provisions were primarily within Section 909.1 of such law.)



   5.   Time Limits for Appeals. The applicable provisions of the MPC
shall apply. (Note:  As of the adoption date of this Ordinance, these
provisions were in Section 914.1 of such Act.)



   6.   Stay of Proceedings. The Stay of Proceedings provisions of the
MPC shall apply. (Note:  As of the adoption date of this Ordinance, such
provisions were in Section 915.1 of such Act.)



   7.   Time Limits on Permits and Approvals.



      A.   After a Variance is approved or other zoning approval
(such as special exception or conditional use approval) is officially
authorized, then any applicable zoning and construction permits shall be
secured by the applicant within 18 months after the date of such approval or
authorization. The work authorized by zoning permits shall then be completed
within the time period specified in construction permits. If construction
permits are not required, then the work shall be completed within 18 months
after issuance of a zoning permit, unless an extension is granted under
subsection "B." below.



         (1)   However, if a Variance is approved to address a
violation of this Zoning Ordinance, then the permit shall be acquired and the
work completed within 6 months after the variance is approved.



         (2)   The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council may
provide for a differing time period in their approval, such as to allow time
for a phased project to be completed.



      B.   Extension. In response to an applicant stating good cause
in writing, the Zoning Officer may extend in writing the time limit for
completion of work under a zoning permit.



      C.   If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or
fails to begin construction within the above time periods, or allows
interruptions in substantial construction of longer than 12 months, the
Zoning Officer shall conclusively presume that the applicant has withdrawn or
abandoned approvals, variances and permits under this Ordinance and all such
approvals, variances and permits shall be deemed rescinded by the Borough.



   8.   Multiple Applications. No more than one application for the
same portions of the same property shall be pending before the Zoning Hearing
Board for special exception approval at any time.

grounds for an appeal or delay. Also, such notice shall be given to any other

(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1417.   Conditional Use Process.

allow the Borough Council to review and approve certain uses that could have
significant impacts upon the community and the environment.



   2.   Procedure. The Borough Council shall consider the conditional
use application and render its decision in accordance with the requirements
of the MPC.



      A.   Submittal. A Site Plan shall be submitted, which shall
contain the information listed in Section 27-1403 .4. Detailed site
engineering (such as stormwater calculations) are not required at the
conditional use stage. If a fully engineered subdivision or land development
plan will be required, it may be submitted separately, such as after a
conditional use is approved.



      B.   Reviews. The Zoning Officer shall provide a review to the
Council regarding the compliance of the application with this Ordinance. The
Planning Commission shall be provided with an opportunity to review the
application, but such review shall not delay an action by Borough Council.



      C.   The only uses that shall be approved as conditional uses
shall be those listed as conditional uses in this Ordinance. See Parts 3 and
4.



      D.   Time Limit. Borough Council shall render a written
decision on each conditional use application within the time limits of the
MPC.  (Note:  As of the adoption date of this Ordinance, such time limit in
Section 913.2 of the MPC was 45 days after the last hearing on the
application.)



      E.   Notice. For a conditional use application, the same
provisions shall apply for notice of persons that apply in Section 27-1412 .1.



   3.   Consideration of Conditional Use Application. The Borough
Council shall determine whether the proposed conditional use would meet the
applicable requirements of this Ordinance. The same standards shall apply to
a conditional use as are listed in Section 27-1416 .3 for a special exception
use.



   4.   Conditions. In approving conditional use applications, the
Borough Council may attach conditions they consider necessary to protect the
public welfare and meet the standards of this Ordinance. These conditions
shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to comply with such
conditions shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and be subject to
the penalties described in this Ordinance.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1418.   Liability.



   1.   Any review of activity within the floodplain, site plan review,
subdivision or land development approval, erosion control review, wetland
delineation review, storm water runoff review, review of activity on steep
slopes, or any other review, approval or permit under this Ordinance by an
officer, employee, board, commission, solicitor, consultant or agency of the
Borough shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any
kind by the Borough, or its employees, officials, boards, solicitor(s),
consultants or agencies of the practicality or safety of any structure, use
or subdivision, and shall create no liability upon nor a cause of action
against such entity or person for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.

Ordinance, the Borough shall not be liable for any later lawful withdrawal of
such permit.

Part 16
AP  Airport Overlay District Regulations



§ 27-1601.   Findings  and  Purposes.



   1.   Applicability.  This Article recognizes that to prevent the
creation or establishment of airport hazards, State law requires every
municipality to adopt and enforce airport hazard area zoning regulations.
These regulations establish airport approach zones that regulate the height
to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be
allowed to grow.  This Section 27-1601 primarily modifies the maximum height
of allowed structures and other regulated items within the airport approach
areas, and does not change the underlying zoning district regulation in other
ways.



   2.   Purposes.  To carry out the Pennsylvania Airport Zoning Act of
1984, as amended, and to prevent hazards and obstructions to air
transportation.

the established airport elevation that is constructed of swinging arcs of
various radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then
connecting the adjacent arc by tangent lines. The horizontal surface zone is
derived from the horizontal surface.



   11.   Larger Than Utility Runway - A runway that is constructed for
and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500

restrictive upon height and/or the control of hazards shall apply.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1604.   Airport Surface Zones.



   1.   There are hereby created and established certain zones which
include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional
surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to an

   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no structure
shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to

height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question
according to the Airport Surface Areas Map.



   2.   This Ordinance shall only apply to structures or growth that
are constructed or modified to result in a total height exceeding 120 feet
above the average surrounding ground level.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1606.   Airport Zoning Requirements.



   1.   Use Restrictions - No use may be made of land or water within
any zone established by this Article in such manner as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the
airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create unusual
bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the
landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.



   2.   Non-Confirming Uses -



      A.   Regulations Not Retroactive - The regulations prescribed
by this Article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or
other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this Article, or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as provided in Section
27-1607 (relating to permits and variances). Nothing contained herein shall
require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of this Article, and is diligently executed.



      B.   Marking and Lighting - Notwithstanding the preceding
provision of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as necessary by the
Zoning Officer in response to a written request in an official review by
airport or aviation authorities, in order to indicate to the operators of
aircraft the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights
shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the owner of
the structure or tree.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1607.   Airport Approach Permits and Variances.



   1.   New and Expanded Structures - No structure shall be erected or
extended higher than 120 feet above the ground level (unless a taller
standard is established below) within an Airport Surface Zone unless there
has been an application for a zoning permit, and a determination of
compliance with the requirements of this Article. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article shall be granted unless a
variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (c) below. Also, a
tree shall not be allowed to grow in a manner that intrudes into an airport
surfaces zone.



      A.   Any person who plans to erect a new structure, to add to
an existing structure, or to erect and maintain any object (natural or
man-made) in the vicinity of the airport shall first notify the Bureau of
Aviation (BOA) by submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction
review of the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The
Bureau's BOA response must be included with this permit application for it to
be considered complete. If the Bureau's BOA returns a determination of no
penetration of air space, the permit request should be considered in
compliance with the intent of this overlay ordinance. If the Bureau's BOA
returns a determination of a penetration of air space, the permit shall be
denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance from such regulations.



   2.   Nonconforming Structures - Before any structure that does not
conform to the height requirements of this Article may be replaced or
extended in height, a zoning permit must be secured.  No permit shall be
granted that would allow a nonconforming structure or tree to become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
Article.



      A.   Existing structures that are non-conforming in regards to
the height requirements of this Article may be modified, repaired and
maintained, provided that the height is not increased, unless there is proof
of compliance with this Article.



   3.   Variance - Any person desiring to erect any structure or
increase the height of any structure or use his/her property in violation of
this Article may apply for a variance from the zoning regulations in
question. Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found
that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this
Article. Any variance may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions
that the Zoning Hearing Board may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes
of this Article. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Zoning
Hearing Board decides to grant a permit or variance under this Article, it
shall notify the Bureau of Aviation in writing of its decision.



   4.   FAA Regulations - Any request for a variance shall include
documentation in compliance with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77
Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1, as amended or replaced). Determinations of
whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations made by the FAA
and the Bureau of Aviation as to the effect of the proposal on the operation
of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable air
space. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider which of the
following categories the FAA has placed the proposed construction in:



      A.   No Objection. The subject construction is determined to
not exceed obstruction standards and marking / lighting is not required to
mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination a variance shall be
granted.



      B.   Conditional Determination. The proposed construction /
alteration is determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination a
variance shall be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating
measures, such as obstruction marking and lighting.



      C.   Objectionable. The proposed construction / alteration is
determined to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be
denied and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the
applicant.



   5.   Notice - Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this Article may be considered by the Zoning Hearing Board
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport Manager
(or person of equivalent role) for advice as to the aeronautical effects of
the variance. If the Airport Manager (or person of equivalent role) does not
respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Zoning Hearing
Board may act without such input to grant or deny said application.



   6.   Hazard Marking and Lighting - Structures shall be illuminated
where required by regulations of the FAA.  In addition, when granting a
variance under this section, the Zoning Hearing Board may (based upon
professional review letters), establish a condition on the variance to
require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth to install,
operate and maintain thereon, at the owner's expense, markers and lights
consistent with standards of the FAA.



   7.   Conflicts - In the event of a direct conflict between this
Article and any other regulations of the Borough, the more stringent
requirement upon height and use of the property shall prevail.



(Ord. 841, 5/22/2017)



§ 27-1608.   Airport Variances and Appeals.



   The Zoning Hearing Board shall, in addition to the other powers granted
to it, have and exercise the following powers:



   1.   to hear and decide appeals from any determination made by the
zoning officer in the enforcement of this Article; and



   2.   to hear and decide specific requests for variances to
provisions of this Article.

CHAPTER 1 - PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
An ordinance providing for the control of the subdivision and development ofland and the
approval of plats and replats ofland within the jurisdiction of the Lebanon County
Commissioners, as a part of the master plan for Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Lebanon County Commissioners, Pennsylvania, under
authority of Article V and VII of the "Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code'', of the
Act of the 1968 General Assembly No. 24 7; as amended, and the Act of October 4, 1978
(Act 167), the "Storm Water Management Act".
SECTION 1.01 TITLE
These regulations, rules, and standards for planning, subdividing, and developing land within
the County of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, including procedures for the application and administration,
and penalties for the violation thereof, shall be known, cited and referred to as the SUBDIVISION
AND LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE for the County of Lebanon (Ord. # 49).
SECTION 1.02 PURPOSE
The general purpose of this ordinance shall be to guide and regulate the planning,
subdividing, and development ofland in order to promote and protect the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare of the residents and municipalities in the
County of Lebanon. This Ordinance shall be used in conjunction with the Lebanon County
Stormwater Ordinance. The Lebanon County Stormwater Ordinance, recognizing the problems
associated with inadequate management of accelerated storm water runoff from uncontrolled
development, intends to provide a comprehensive program of storm water management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion which is deemed
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the County of
Lebanon, as well as their resources and environment.
SECTION 1.03 OBJECTIVES
It is intended that the provisions of these regulations shall be applied to achieve the following
objectives:
A. Orderly development of the land to obtain harmonious and stable neighborhoods; and
B. Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation; and
C. Adequate and economical provisions for utilities and public services to conserve the
public funds; and
D. Ample public open space for schools, recreational and other public purposes; and
E. Accurate surveying of land, preparing and recording of plats; and
F. Discouragement of premature, uneconomical, or scattered subdivision; and
G. Maximize conservation of all forms of energy; and
H. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the municipality,
county and the Commonwealth; and
I. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams; and
J. Coordination of land development in accordance with the Zoning Code, Long Range
Transportation Plan, Comprehensive Plan, Lebanon County Stormwater Ordinance,
Watershed Plans, and other plans of the Municipality and County.

SECTION 1.04 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS
No subdivision or land development of any lot, tract or parcel of land located within Lebanon
County shall be affected; no street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main, storm water control
facilities, or other facilities in connection therewith shall be laid out, constructed, opened, or
dedicated for travel or public use, until a subdivision or land development plan has been approved in
the manner prescribed herein, and recorded. Furthermore, no property shall be developed, no
building shall be erected and no site improvements shall be completed except in strict accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance.
No lot in a subdivision may be sold or transferred; no permit to erect or alter any building
upon land in a subdivision or land development may be issued; and no buildings may be erected in a
subdivision or land development, unless and until any required final subdivision or land
development plat has been approved and recorded, and until construction of any required site
improvements in connection therewith has been completed or guaranteed in the manner prescribed
herein.
Approvals issued pursuant to this Ordinance do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility
to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by other agencies or levels of
government.
SECTION 1.05 JURISDICTION
A. Municipalities with Subdivision Regulations: Any township, borough or city within Lebanon
County which has a subdivision or land development ordinance in effect shall not be under
jurisdiction of this ordinance. However, applications for subdivision and land development
located within a township, borough or city which has adopted a subdivision and land
development ordinance shall be forwarded, upon receipt by the municipality, to the Planning
Department for review and report, together with a fee as established elsewhere herein.
Furthermore, such municipalities shall not approve such applications until the county report is
received or until the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date the application was forwarded to
the County.
B. Municipalities without Subdivision Regulations: Any township, borough or city within Lebanon
County which does not have a subdivision or land development ordinance in effect shall be
under the jurisdiction of this ordinance. Applications for subdivision and land development
located within a township, borough or city which has not adopted a subdivision and land
development ordinance shall be submitted to the Planning Department for approval or
disapproval. The subdivision or land development plan may be forwarded by the Planning
Department to the township, borough or city for review and comment prior to formal action by
the Planning Department.
C. Adoption of the County Ordinance by Reference: Any township, borough or city within
Lebanon County may adopt, by reference, the Lebanon County Subdivision and Land

CHAPTER 3 - PROCEDURES
SECTION 3.01 INTENT
The procedures established in this Chapter are intended to define the steps by which a
developer shall design, make an application, record plats, and construct improvements, and by which
the Planning Department may review, make recommendations, approve plans and otherwise
administer these regulations and this Ordinance.
For those subdivisions hereinafter classified as minor subdivisions, a sketch plan and
abbreviated final plan procedure is established. For all others, which are classified as major
subdivisions or land development, a preliminary plan and final plat procedure is established.
SECTION 3.02 PRE-APPLICATION
The Planning Department shall make available to developers copies of this subdivision and
land development ordinance, the zoning code, the Lebanon County Stormwater Management
Ordinance, the transportation improvement plan and other adopted plans, street maps, and other
information which may affect the development of the property under consideration. Applications for
approval of a subdivision or land development shall be in accord with these regulations, other codes
and plans as adopted and information furnished.
Prior to the formal submission of a subdivision or land development plan for review and
approval, the subdivider or land developer is urged to submit a sketch plan to the Planning
Department for advice on the requirements necessary to achieve conformity to the standards of these
regulations as well as to alert the subdivider or land developer as early as possible to factors which
must be considered in the design of a subdivision or land development, such as pertinent elements of
any County of Municipal land use, thoroughfare or other community plans. Review of a sketch plan
is an informal, advisory process to guide the subdivider or land developer in eventual preparation of
a formal preliminary or final plan.
Sketch plans and subsequent official minor and major subdivision and land development
plans should be accompanied by any letters of transmittal or development details necessary to
explain existing or proposed site conditions which are not self-explanatory on the actual sketch,
minor or major subdivision or land development plan.
SECTION 3.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT
A. Classification - A division of land to facilitate a lot addition or a land exchange or a division of
land which adjoins an existing public street and does not involve the opening, widening,
extension or improvement of any street or the installation of any public utility outside the
frontage road and does not involve more than five (5) lots or dwelling units (except that
subdivision oflots from a property after five (5) or more lots have been previously subdivided is
a major subdivision).
Dedication or establishment of an unimproved right-of-way or easement shall be a minor
subdivision. Replatting, resubdivision or revision of five (5) lots or less shall also be considered
a minor subdivision. Multi-family, commercial, industrial and mobile home park development
14
shall be a major, not minor, subdivision or land development, regardless of the number oflots or
units created.
B. Application - A final plan complying with the requirements set forth in this Ordinance shall be
prepared for each minor subdivision or land development and approval of said plat shall be
requested from the Planning Department.
When filing an application for approval of a minor subdivision or land development, the
subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department two (2) blue line paper prints of the proposal,
on sheets not exceeding 24" x 36'', and two (2) copies of any associated reports.
C. Review - Upon receipt of the minor subdivision or land development plan, the Planning
Department shall begin to review the final plan for compliance with this ordinance. Where
applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the County Engineer, the County Conservation District
or other agencies for review and comment. After initial review, the final plan may be forwarded
to the municipality in which the development is to occur to provide the municipal planning
commission and governing body an opportunity for review and comment. Review comments,
conditions and findings of the municipality may be used as substantiation for plan approval or
disapproval. After completion of the review process, the final plan shall be approved or
disapproved by the Planning Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities that have adopted
their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be forwarded to said municipalities
within thirty (30) days from the date the application was forwarded to the Planning Department.
D. Approval or Disapproval - After an application for approval of a plat of a minor subdivision or
land development has been filed with the Planning Department, together will all maps, necessary
data, and fees, the plan shall be reviewed and processed. The subdivider or developer shall pay
required review fees at the time of official submission of the plat and official submission shall
not be deemed to have been made until receipt of all the required review fees. The Planning
Department shall complete the review and either approve or disapprove the plat not later than
ninety (90) days after such application submission is filed. The decision shall be in writing and
shall be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last known address not
later than fifteen (15) days following the decision.
When the application is approved, it shall be appropriately signed and dated and copies shall be
distributed according to Section 3.03(E) of this Ordinance. When the application is disapproved,
the decision shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the requirements
which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the provisions of the Ordinance relied upon.
A disapproved copy of the subdivision or land development plan shall be retained by the
Planning Department, one copy shall be sent to the municipality and any remaining copies shall
be returned to the subdivider, developer and/or his agent.
Failure of the Planning Department to render a decision and communicate it to the applicant
within the time and in the manner required herein shall be deemed approval of the application in
the terms as presented, unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or
change in the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the decision in which case,
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of presentation of communication shall
have like effect. However, removal or withdrawal of the subdivision or land development plan
15
from the approval process by the subdivider, developer and/or his agent shall be considered
withdrawal of plan application, shall not obligate the Planning Department to approve or
disapprove the plan within the herein described timetable and shall not result in a deemed
approval when ninety (90) days have elapsed. Upon knowledge of plan withdrawal, the Planning
Department shall notify, in writing, the subdivider or land developer that plan withdrawal has
disrupted the approval process and no approval or disapproval will be rendered unless the
subdivision or land development plan is resubmitted as a new application.
E. Recording - When filing an application for recording of a minor subdivision or land
development, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department nine (9) blue line paper
prints of the proposal on 18" x 24" sheets. When the 18" x 24" size plans are prepared by

After approval of a minor subdivision or land development plat by the Planning Department, the
original plat paper copy, containing original, notarized signatures and original professional
endorsements, shall be filed and recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, said
recording to occur within ninety (90) days of the final or deemed approval date of the plan or the
approval shall be null and void. Whenever such plat approval is required by this Ordinance, the
Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plat for recording unless such plat officially notes the
approval of the Planning Department. Likewise, whenever plan review and comment by the
Planning Department is required by municipal ordinance (Sect. 3.03C), the Recorder of Deeds
shall not accept any plat for recording unless such plat officially notes the review of the Planning
Department.

SECTION 3.04 MAJOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT - PRELIMINARY PLAN
A. Classification - Any subdivision or land development involving more than five (5) lots or
dwelling units; or any subdivision or land development on a property after five (5) or more lots
or dwelling units have previously been subdivided from that property; or any subdivision or land
development proposing the opening, widening, extension or improvement of a street shall be
deemed to be a major subdivision or land development. Multi-family, mobile home park,
commercial and industrial development shall be considered major subdivision or land
development, regardless of the number oflots or units created.
B. Application - A preliminary plat complying with the requirements set forth in this Ordinance
shall be prepared for each major subdivision or land development and an approval requested
from the Planning Department.
When filing an application for preliminary approval of a major subdivision or land development,
the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department two (2) blue line prints of the proposal.
As part of the submission, the subdivider shall also submit two (2) paper prints of the
improvement plan (if not contained on initial sheet) containing details of the physical site
16
improvements (roadways, utilities, etc.) proposed for the subdivision or land development. All
sheets shall be 18" x 24" or 24" x 36" , and two (2) copies of any associated reports.
C. Review - Upon receipt of the preliminary plan (and improvement plan, if separate), the Planning
Department shall begin to review the plan for compliance with this Ordinance. The preliminary
plan shall be examined for suitable relationship to adjoining subdivisions or undeveloped land,
feasibility of the program for improvements, and provide an opportunity for advice, suggestions,
and adjustments to meet ordinance requirements before the plan becomes rigid. The submission
of alternate plans is recommended.
Where applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the County Engineer, County Conservation
District, or other appropriate agency for review and comment. After initial review, the
preliminary plan, plus any applicable improvement plan, may be forwarded to the municipality
in which the development is to occur to provide the municipal planning commission and
governing body an opportunity for review and comment. Review comments, conditions and
findings of the municipalities may be used as substantiation for plan approval or disapproval.
After completion of the review process, the preliminary plan and improvement plan shall be
approved or disapproved by the Planning Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities that have adopted
their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be forwarded to the said
municipalities within thirty (30) days from the date the application was forwarded to the
Planning Department.
D. Approval or Disapproval - After an application for preliminary approval of a plat of a major
subdivision or land development has been filed with the Planning Department, together with all
improvement plans, maps, necessary data and fees, the Planning Department shall complete the
review and either approve or disapprove the plan in accordance with the procedure outlines in
Section 3.03(D).
E. Recording - After approval of a preliminary plan for a major subdivision or land development
plat by the Planning Department, recording of the preliminary plan is not authorized.
Approval of the preliminary plan shall assure the subdivider for a period of five (5) years from
the date of approval that:
1. The general layout of streets, lots, and other features are approved and shall be the basis for
the preparation of the final plan; and
2. The general terms and any special conditions under which the approval of the plan was
granted will not be changed; and
3. The subdivider may install improvements in accordance with the approved preliminary plan
and other requirements contained in this Ordinance and those ordinances of local
municipalities where the subdivision is located.
Approval of a preliminary plan does not constitute approval of the final plan, and therefore,
does ilot authorize the recording of the subdivision or land development plan or the sale or
transfer oflots. After a period of five (5) years, approval of the preliminary plan shall expire.

SECTION 3.05 MAJOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT- FINAL PLAN
A. Classification -Any subdivision or land development involving more than five (5) lots or
dwelling units; or any subdivision or land development on a property after five (5) or more lots
or dwelling units have previously been subdivided from that property; or any subdivision or land
development proposing the opening, widening, extension or improvement of a street shall be
deemed to be a major subdivision or land development. Multi-family, mobile home park,
commercial and industrial development shall be considered major subdivision or land
development, regardless of the number oflots or units created.
B. Application - Within five (5) years after the approval of the preliminary plat, a final plat with all
necessary supplemental data shall be officially submitted to the Planning Department with a
request for approval. Failure to submit a final plan within five (5) years of the date of an
approval of the preliminary plat shall void the preliminary approval, unless extended in writing
by the Planning Department. Said expired or voided preliminary plan shall not be used as a basis
for any development or construction. Any subsequent development shall be preceded by a new
preliminary plan.
When filing an application for approval of a major subdivision or land development, the
subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department two (2) blue line paper prints of the proposal
on sheets not exceeding 24" x 36", and two (2) copies of any associated reports.
The subdivider or developer may apply for final approval of: 1) only a portion, section or phase
of the entire subdivision or land development as preliminarily approved; or 2) the entire
subdivision or land development.
C. Review - Upon receipt of the final plan, the Planning Department shall begin to review the plan
for compliance with this Ordinance. The final plan shall be examined for conformity to the
preliminary plan, for design and detail of required site improvements and for adherence to other
standards of this Ordinance. The plan shall also be examined to determine if the required site
improvements have been installed or, in lieu thereof, a bond or financial security has been
submitted. Where applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the County Engineer, the County
Conservation District or other agencies for review and comment. After initial review, the final
plan may be forwarded to the municipality in which the development is to occur to provide the
municipal planning commission and governing body an opportunity for review and comment.
Review comments, conditions and findings of the municipality may be used as substantiation for
plan approval or disapproval. After completion of the review process, the final plan shall be
approved or disapproved by the Planning Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities that have adopted
their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be forwarded to the said
municipalities within thirty (30) days from the date the application was forwarded to the
Planning Department.

However, no plat shall be finally approved unless the streets on such plat have been improved as
may be required by ordinance, and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants,
shade trees, landscaping, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, storm water management
facilities, and other site improvements as may be required by this Ordinance and any applicable
municipal requirements have been installed in accordance with such requirements. In lieu of the
completion of any site improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat, a
financial security shall be deposited by the subdivider/developer with the municipality and/or
county in an amount to cover the costs of any site improvements which may be required by
ordinance. Such financial security shall provide for and secure to the public, the completion of
any site improvements which may be required for the subdivision or land development.
Financial improvement guarantees shall further be subject to the requirements of Section 5.14 of
this Ordinance and Sections 5. 09 - 5 .11 of Act 24 7.
E. Recording - After approval of a final plat for a major subdivision or land development by the
Planning Department, the plat shall be recorded and copies distributed in the manner prescribed
in Section 3.03 (E) of this Ordinance.
Recording shall entitle the subdivider to sell, transfer or develop the land shown on the plat in
accordance with the approved plat, subject to any conditions attached thereto. Where final plans
are approved for only a portion, section or phase of the entire subdivision or land development,
sale, transfer or development may proceed only on that approved portion, section or phase.
When a final plat has been approved, no subsequent change or amendment in zoning, subdivision
or other governing ordinance shall be applied to affect adversely the right of the subdivider or
land developer to commence and complete any aspect of the approved development in
accordance with the terms of such approval within five (5) years from such approval. Where
final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid five-year period shall be
counted from the date of the preliminary approval.
When the subdivider or land developer has failed to substantially complete development of the
approved plan within five (5) years of the aforesaid approval date and when changes in a zoning,
subdivision, or other governing ordinance have occurred which affect the design of the approved
plat, the subdivision or land development shall be subject to the changes in the zoning,
subdivision, or other governing ordinance. The Planning Department shall notify, in writing, the
subdivider or land developer that approval has expired and submission and approval of a revised
preliminary and/or final plan (as necessary to detail changes), illustrating compliance with the
revised ordinance, is required prior to further development or lot transfer.

CHAPTERS
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION 5.01 INTENT
The design standards established in this Chapter are intended to be fundamental requirements to
be applied with professional skill in the subdividing and planning ofland so as to produce attractive
and harmonious neighborhoods, convenient and safe streets, and economical layouts of residential
and other land development. The design standards are further intended to encourage and promote
flexibility and ingenuity in the layout and design of subdivisions and land developments, in
accordance with modem and evolving principles of site planning and development. It is further
intended that subdivision and land development designs shall promote interconnectivity and
walkability within neighborhoods, protection of natural features and resources, reservation of open
space areas and emphasize the preservation and planting of trees along streets, within parking areas
and in developed areas.
It is also the intent of this Chapter to require subdividers and developers to follow all applicable
codes, regulations, and standards adopted by the municipality or the County relative to
improvements to the subdivision or development site. In all cases, the codes, regulations and
standards of the municipality shall be followed and the improvements shall be approved by the
municipal governing body before the final plan is approved. In cases where development codes,
regulations, and standards do not exist at the municipal level, the requirements of this Chapter shall
be followed and approved by the Planning Department. All improvements as specified in this
Chapter or in applicable municipal ordinances shall be installed before the final plat is approved or,
in lieu thereof, a guarantee of installation shall be provided by the subdivider or developer prior to
final plat approval. The guarantee shall assure the responsible body (Municipality or County) that
the required improvements will be installed in accordance with the subdivision or land development
plan.
During the design and approval of subdivision and land development plans the Planning
Department, the municipal planning agency and governing body, and the developer shall give
primary consideration to all transportation plans, watershed plans, water plans, sewer plans,
community facility plans, county and municipal comprehensive plans and official maps as may be in
effect in the municipality.
SECTION 5.02 GENERAL STANDARDS
In addition to the standards contained elsewhere in these regulations, the following general
standards shall be observed.
A. Existing utilities and improvements shall be utilized wherever possible. New roads and extended
utility services shall be discouraged if existing services and facilities may be utilized. Scattered
urban development shall be avoided.
B. Development designs shall minimize street lengths necessary to serve developed properties.
27
C. Side lot lines should be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines, unless the purpose of
lot line orientation is to obtain greater solar access.
D. Depth of residential lots should be not less than one (1) nor more than two and a half (2-1/2)
times the lot width.
E. Every lot shall abut a street. Lot frontage or access shall be physically accessible by standard
vehicle in existing condition or the Planning Department shall require illustration of the site
improvements planned and necessary to alter steep banks, flood plains, visibility limitations, etc.
to a condition that will facilitate safe and adequate access. The Planning Department may also
require that lots be arranged to reserve a right-of-way for street access to future lots.
F. Double or reverse frontage lots may be preferred or required when lot access to an adjoining
street is not permitted or separation from the street is desired because of topographic, orientation,
aesthetic, congestion, safety or high noise level considerations. Landscaping and buffering
should be provided along the adjoining street.
G. Adequate easements or rights-of-way shall be required for drainage and utilities. Easements
shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width and, whenever possible, shall be centered on
side or rear lot lines. No structure or buildings or plantings other than grass shall be erected
within such easements.
H. Additional lot areas beyond minimum size may be required:
1. On slopes in excess of 15%.
2. To control erosion or storm water runoff.
3. To provide sufficient area for sewage disposal.
I. Lots shall be suitably shaped to encourage and facilitate use and maintenance of all portions of
the lot. Accordingly, lots shall be square or generally rectangular in shape. Lot configurations
which result in L-shaped, T-shaped, triangular or otherwise inappropriately shaped lots shall be
avoided.
J. Site design and development shall include reasonable efforts to save existing trees and vegetation
as well as illustrating a proposed tree planting and landscaping design.
K. The standards of this Ordinance shall apply to all lots being subdivided or developed and
residual land which is created by the subdivision or land development activity.
L. Subdivision of property with existing dwellings or development shall be regulated by the
following:
1. Each dwelling or use shall be serviced by separate utility connections. Shared sewage
systems are not permitted.
2. Each dwelling or use subdivided shall be on sufficient land area to satisfy minimum lot area
and yard setback requirements. Where adequate land area is not available to satisfy
minimum standards, subdivision may be permitted when:
a. Each dwelling or principal building is in good structural condition.
28
b. Mobile homes are not involved.
c. An equitable distribution ofland is proposed between the existing uses or buildings.
M. Lot additions, land exchanges, agricultural use only lands, and any other specific or special
purpose subdivision or land development shall include prominent plan notes to avoid
misinterpretation of the intent of the subdivision or land development plan. Applicable deed
restrictions may be required.
N. Deeds filed subsequent to subdivision or land development approval shall accurately and
correctly describe the property therein. Deeds and use of the property shall be in complete
compliance with all plan notes and conditions. Recording a deed which omits or contradicts the
information on an approved subdivision or land development plan shall be a violation of this
Ordinance.
0. Subdivision/development ofresidential lots/units shall require the dedication ofrecreation and
open space land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, in accordance with the following
requirements:
I. Dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof, for recreation and open space
use shall be in accordance with any duly adopted municipal or county Recreation and
Open Space Plan. Therefore, it is the intent and scope of these provisions to apply the
recreation dedication, or fee payment in lieu thereof, requirements as follows:
a. Where a municipality has adopted a municipal Recreation and Open Space
Plan, the subdivider or land developer shall satisfy all recreation and open
space requirements and obligations with the appropriate municipal officials
including, but not limited to, agreement on any lands to be dedicated or fees to
be paid in lieu thereof. Documentation shall be provided to the Planning
Department to verify satisfaction of municipal requirements. All subdividers
and land developers who comply with municipal Recreation and Open Space
Plan requirements shall be exempt from County Recreation and Open Space
Plan requirements, but are urged to adhere to recreation and open space
guidance provided within the Lebanon County Recreation and Open Space
Plan.
b. Where no municipal Recreation and Open Space Plan exists the subdivider or
land developer shall comply with the requirements of the Lebanon County
Recreation and Open Space Plan, including dedication of land or payment of
fees in lieu thereof, in accordance with the schedule established in Section
8.05 of this Ordinance and the provisions listed therein.
2. Dedication of land for recreation and open space, or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof, shall be in accordance with the standards established within the Lebanon
County Recreation and Open Space Plan. A summary of fee costs is listed within

be adjusted for inflation from time to time, as deemed necessary by the County
Commissioners. Fees in lieu shall be paid prior to approval of the final subdivision or
land development plan. Where final plan phases are proposed, applicable fees shall
29
accompany each phased plan. Deeds for transfer of dedicated land shall be executed
and recorded a) after improvement of the land as required on the approved plan,
b) prior to transfer or occupancy of 50% of the lots within the development, c) in
accordance with the terms of any written agreement with the Planning Department, or
d) within sixty (60) days of notice by the Planning Department.
3. Standards and criteria for land to be dedicated are as follows:
a. Recreation and open space shall be intended for public access, with amenities
suitable for access, use and maintenance.
b. Additions to adjacent existing or future public park and recreation areas are a
priority for land dedication.
c. Prior to plan approval, documentation shall be provided to the Planning
Department to verify County or Municipal agreement to accept dedication of
the offered land. Absent an acceptance verification, fees in lieu of dedication
will be required.
d. Land suitable for recreation and open space use shall have minimal limitations
or intrusions to detract from the intended use, with no more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the land area to contain easements, flood plain, steep slopes,
wetlands, storm water facilities and similar limiting features (unless such
areas are vital to achieving trail and greenway initiatives of the Lebanon
County Comprehensive Plan).
e. With the agreement of the Planning Department, credit toward land dedication
or fee in lieu costs may be granted to subdividers or land developers who
propose and complete acceptable public recreation site improvements,
facilities construction or equipment installation at approved locations. Credit
value shall be documented by the subdivider or land developer and be subject
to County review to verify the value.
4. All fees collected by the Planning Department in accordance with these provisions
shall be administered in conformance with the following guidelines:
a. Funds shall be deposited and held in a separate County fund, exclusively for
recreation and open space use. Interest earned on such funds shall become
part of the fund. The fund shall be referred to as the Recreation and Open
Space Fund.
b. The Recreation and Open Space Fund shall be utilized to fund acquisition and
site development of public recreation and open space sites. Expenditures shall
be designed to meet the goals, objectives and recommendations of the
Lebanon County Recreation and Open Space Plan. Although intended
principally for acquisition and site development, a maximum of ten percent
(10%) of the funds expended during any calendar year may be utilized for
maintenance or administration of recreation facilities and sites, where need is
demonstrated for remediation to create safe, accessible recreational
opportunities.
30
c. The Planning Department shall administer the Recreation and Open Space
Fund and the Executive Director is authorized to approve fund expenditures,
in accordance with procedures approved by the County Commissioners.
Where deemed necessary, a Committee, Board or Advisory group may be

to the Executive Director of the Planning Department in management of the
Recreation and Open Space Fund.
d. Priorities for expenditure of collected funds shall be, in order, as follows:
1. Expenditure within the municipality where the funds originated.
11. Where municipalities have no eligible recreation and open space
projects, site or interest in funding for such facilities, expenditures
shall be directed to other municipalities within the same school
district.
111. Where expenditures are not feasible within the municipality or
school district of fund origin, expenditures shall be directed to
recreation sites which provide services, accessibility and recreational
opportunities for a larger area of Lebanon County.
1v. Expenditures may be used by municipalities, where awarded, and by
the county to provide funding assistance, matching funds for grants
and donations, and funding support for recreational organizations,
conservancies and similar recreation oriented agencies which are
cooperating with municipal and/or county officials to facilitate the
acquisition and/or development of public recreation and open space.
SECTION 5.03 ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS
Conservation of energy shall be an important principle in the design of subdivisions and land
developments. Plans shall facilitate the energy efficient placement of homes and buildings on lots.
Whenever the following criteria are found to be appropriate to a site, development design shall be in
accordance with the standards contained herein.
A. Orientation
1. Lots shall be designed for energy efficient siting of buildings with respect to slopes and
existing trees.
2. Southerly exposures should be utilized for development. North slopes, especially those over
10% slope, should be avoided because the long shadows created severely restrict solar
access.
3. New lots and new residences shall be oriented to make maximum effective use of passive
solar energy. The long axis (depth) of each lot should run North-South, with a possible EastWest
variation of 22-1 /2 degrees. Lot design should provide for lots of adequate width,
31
depth, and slope for solar orientation. Lot layout should facilitate solar access by at least
75% of the proposed dwellings or buildings within a development.
4. The largest yard setback should be stipulated on the south side of proposed buildings.
Buildings should be situated to the North end of the lot to permit maximum on-lot control of
solar skyspace.
B. Streets
1. Streets should be oriented along an East-West axis, with maximum North-South deviations
of 30 degrees. This should be required to the maximum extent possible, although size,
configuration or orientation of the property; nature of the surrounding development;
circulation patterns; existing physical features such as topography and vegetation (trees); and
improved design potential may be considered to determine the feasibility of this requirement
for a given site.
2. Street system shall be designed to reduce overall lengths and facilitate traffic flow (minimum
number of intersections).
3. The street system shall be bordered by trees, in accordance with standards of this Ordinance
and the municipality.
C. Vegetation and Wind
1. Site design shall emphasize the preservation of all beneficial natural features of the site, such
as existing slope, naturally wooded areas, and water courses. The site design should also
avoid requiring removal of large isolated trees and desirable woods and other vegetation,
particularly those existing plant materials which serve as wind barriers and aid in energy
conservation.
2. Developments shall be designed to maximize wind buffering and/or breeze channelization
capabilities of vegetation, topography and structure layouts. Wind breaks and buffers should
utilize evergreens to protect north and northwesterly exposures. Cooling breezes from the
southwest should be channeled past buildings. Deciduous trees shall be located in areas
which will enable them to shade buildings from the summer sun, but still allow penetration of
the winter sun.
SECTION 5.04 TOPOGRAPHY
Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography ofland in order to: utilize the
natural contours, economize in the construction of drainage facilities, reduce the amount of grading,
and minimize destruction of trees and topsoil. The natural features and other distinctive
characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the
neighborhoods.
Additionally, environmental safeguards may be mandated on slopes in excess of 15%. On steep
slopes (in excess of 15%), site and lot design shall be adjusted, where necessary, to mitigate the
detrimental effects of development on steeper slopes. The following topographic considerations
shall be utilized in design of subdivisions and land developments:
32
A. Streets - Land which is relatively flat or of very gentle slopes should be planned so that the
streets follow the natural drainage courses and as many lots as possible shall be above the street
grade. On more irregular topography, streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills
and follow the ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines, and adjusted,
however, so that lots on one (1) side of the street will not be excessively below the street grade.
B. Natural Drainage - Subdivisions shall be designed, particularly on land of very gentle slopes, to
take every advantage of natural grades so that all the land can be drained without excessive
grading. Unless water courses or drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that
rear lot lines shall be approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only where
such plan is not possible, should side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course.
Easements for drainage ways and low-lying land which are subject to flooding may be included
as part of a lot but shall not be used as building sites or included in calculating the required lot
area or width.
C. Natural Features - Natural features, irregularities, changes in level, brooks, lakes, hilltops, and
other focal points within the site, and distant views outside the subdivision shall be integrated in
the design to obtain variations and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive building
sites. Trees, topsoil, and other natural resources shall be preserved and utilized in the
development of the subdivision.
D. Driveways - Private driveways shall be designed to furnish safe and convenient access, with
rea-sonable clear sight distance at intersection with the street. Site improvements shall be
required to insure adequate site visibility at the point of access and installation of a stable,
erosion resistant driveway surface. Driveway site distances shall be consistent with current
PENNDOT requirements (Specifications located in appendix) and appropriate radii shall be
provided.
Steep slopes shall be traversed diagonally to minimize grades. Driveway grades shall not
exceed 15% slope at any point. All driveways shall be designed and improved with a rolled
stone or paved surface, sufficient to avoid erosion. When driveway grades exceed 10% slope
driveways shall be paved to minimize erosion. Required driveway improvements shall be
guaranteed in accordance with Section 5.14 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 5.05 GRADING
The developer shall grade each subdivision or land development to establish street grades, floor
elevations of buildings, and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to existing topography.
However, grading shall be kept to a minimum to avoid loss of topsoil and erosion potential. Lots
shall be graded to secure drainage away from buildings. The grading shall facilitate collection of
storm water in designated areas and avoid concentration of water in the sewage system location.
The grading of the roadway shall extend the full width of the cartway, shoulder and swale area, if
applicable. Where possible, grass strips or channels between the curb or shoulder and right-of-way
line should be graded at 3: 1 slope; however, when unusual topographic conditions exist, good
engineering practice shall prevail.
33
SECTION 5.06 LOT SIZES AND STANDARDS
The minimum lot size and lot width requirements established by municipal zoning ordinance
shall be utilized as minimum subdivision standards. All lots shall satisfy the municipal zoning
standard for lot width and lot size at the time of subdivision. Additionally, the building setback lines
established by the municipal zoning ordinance shall be applicable and shall be noted on each
subdivision or land development plan. Additionally, each subdivision or land development plan
shall satisfy all other applicable zoning standards, unless variance thereto has been granted.
In cases where zoning standards have not been enacted or might otherwise be determined not to
be valid, the following uniform standard shall apply for new building lots.
Minimum Minimum Minimum Setbacks
Available Utilities* Lot size Lot Width Front Side Rear
On-lot Well & Sewage 1 Acre 150' 40' 15 ' 40'
Public Water/On-lot Sewage 30,000 sq.ft. 135' 40' 15' 40'

SECTION 5.07
Superseded by the Lebanon County Stormwater Management Ordinance
SECTION 5.08 SEWAGE DISPOSAL
Sewage disposal facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the needs of the proposed
subdivision or land development. Sewage disposal facilities shall also meet all requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Municipal Act 537 Sewage Plan in the
municipality wherein the subdivision or land development is located. The following requirements
specify the design and installation standards for subsurface sewage disposal and public and private
sewerage systems.
A. Subsurface Sewage Disposal - All subdivisions and land developments proposing subsurface
sewage disposal shall be designed and submitted in compliance with the prevailing requirements
of the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, D.E.P. and, where applicable, the Delegated Local
Agency. It is the intent of this section to co-ordinate a simultaneous review of subdivision and
land development plans with sewage planning modules at the municipal level, thereby avoiding
the approval oflots that are not suitable for sewage disposal. Where required by Municipal
Sewage Plans, on-site sewage testing shall be supplemented with a Hydrogeologic Study which
may dictate increased lot sizes or reservation of ground water easement areas. In accordance
with those standards, application for subdivision or land development approval shall satisfy the
following procedural requirements:
1. Minor Subdivision - The subdivider shall submit the sewage planning module and required
associated information to the sewage enforcement officer at the time of final plat application.
The subdivision or land development plan shall not be processed until documentation is
provided to verify that the sewage enforcement officer has approved the sewage planning
34
module. All newly created lots, whether for immediate or future use, shall be tested and
approved for sewage suitability.
2. Major Subdivision - The subdivider shall submit a preliminary plan depicting general lot
layout and street design, as required elsewhere herein. The subdivider shall submit the
required sewage planning module and associated information to the sewage enforcement
officer at the time of preliminary plan application. The subdivision or land development plan
shall not be processed until documentation is provided to verify that the sewage enforcement
officer has approved the sewage planning module.
B. Existing Public Sewers - When a subdivision or land development has public sewers available
on-site or within one thousand ( 1,000) feet of the site, sewer lines shall be included on the
subdivision or land development plan and installation must be approved by the municipal
authority responsible for the sewer system. Written documentation is required from the Authority
to verify adequate capacity, agreement to provide service, and specific design approval.
C. Planned Sewer Area - When a proposed subdivision or land development is located in an area
not presently served by public sewers, but which has received design data preparatory to sewer
system installation within eighteen (18) months, then the municipality shall determine the
necessity of installing house connections and/or capped mains, even though on-site facilities will
be required in the interim. Installation of house connections and capped mains shall be in
accordance with municipal design data and approved by the municipal engineer prior to approval
of a preliminary or final plan.
D. Private Sewerage System - When a subdivision or land development is to be provided with a
private sewerage system, a statement shall be submitted to the Planning Department from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection verifying that a permit has been issued
approving the proposed facilities. Additionally, the municipality must be satisfied that adequate
provisions have been made to guarantee the construction and maintenance of the proposed
private sewerage system.
E. Plan Notice
1. Subsurface Sewage Disposal - All subdivision and land development plans shall contain a
plan note specifying that approval of the plan does not guarantee permit issuance for sewage
disposal.
2. Public Sewers - All subdivision and land development plans shall contain a plan note
specifying that connection to public sewer lines is required.
3. Lot additions in non-public sewer areas/agricultural parcels - non-building language to be
displayed as provided in appendix and proper documentation to be processed through
Sewage Enforcement Officer and municipality.
SECTION 5.09 WATER SUPPLY
A water supply system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider or developer as
required by the municipality, water company, or water authority in relation to the specific site of the
proposed subdivision or land development. The water supply system shall be capable of meeting the
domestic and fire protection needs of the site. When possible, the subdivision or land development
35
should be served by a public water supply system approved by municipal water officials or a
community water system approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. If
the subdivision or land development is to be supplied by a public or community water system, the
subdivider or developer shall submit a written certification, commitment or evidence that the
municipal water company or authority or the association oflot owners or private company, as
applicable, has adequate water capacity, has agreed to provide water service and has approved the
specific water system design.
When a subdivision or land development has public water on-site or within five hundred (500)
feet of the site, public water lines shall be extended as necessary to service the lots and uses on the
subdivision and land development plan, subject to approval by the municipal authority responsible
for the water system. In those cases where a public or community water system is not available or
practical, a well shall be provided for each lot. Wells shall be placed uphill from sewage disposal
systems. Wells shall not be within one hundred feet (100') of any part of the absorption field of any
on-site sewage disposal system and they shall not be placed within fifty feet (50') of lakes, streams,
ponds, quarries, etc.
Subdivision or land development proposals which involve the daily use of 10,000 gallons or
more of well or surface water shall be accompanied by a Hydrologic Study to document the
adequacy of the water supply without endangering water availability for adjoining landowners.
Review and, where applicable, approval may be required from D.E.P. and the Delaware or
Susquehanna River Basin Commission, as applicable.
Subdivision and land development plans shall contain a plan note specifying the source of water
supply. Plans proposing the use of public or community water shall contain a note specifying that
connection to the public or community water lines, as applicable, is required. Plans proposing the
use of individual wells shall contain a note specifying that the lot(s) has not been tested for the
availability of water of adequate quality or quantity and no guarantee of water availability is
provided.
SECTION 5.10 STREETS
In addition to relating to topography, natural features and solar orientation, streets shall be
designed according to the function served, the use of abutting land, and standards of width,
intersections, maximum grades and curvatures. The Planning Department shall require that all
developments have adequate access. Where major subdivision is proposed or may occur because of
the patterns started by minor subdivision activity, the Planning Department should require
reservation for, or installation of, two or more streets to insure safe and convenient access.
Elimination or vacation of previously approved streets shall be approved only when the Planning
Department determines that 1) alternate access has been provided in another, more suitable location,
2) further development is not possible utilizing the street, and 3) any land owners who purchased
property with reliance upon the street agree in writing to its elimination.
The developer shall design and construct streets, including pavements, shoulders, gutters, curbs,
etc., as required by municipal ordinance. Where specific municipal regulations do not exist, the
following requirements shall apply.
A. Classification and General Design Goals
36
1. Major Streets - function primarily for the movement of fast traffic between points of heavy
traffic generation. They are often known as arterial streets or highways. They shall be
planned for continuation of existing streets in the system at the same or greater width in
accordance with adopted municipal standards. Major streets shall contain as few
intersections as possible.
2. Collector Streets - function to collect traffic from local streets and distribute it into major
streets, and, as such, they will normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with
local streets and few with main streets. A collector street system may be required wherever a
residential neighborhood near a major street is over 150 acres in area or where the local street
pattern is so designed as to converge and serve over 500 one-family dwellings, or 100 multifamily
units. Collector streets shall be planned for continuity and to lead more or less directly
to one or more focal points or centers of traffic generation, and may become bus routes.
3. Local Streets - provide direct access to each lot and function to allow traffic to circulate
toward the principal directions of travel, bus routes, schools and playgrounds; however, the
design shall discourage through and high speed traffic. The street pattern shall be indirect
and yet continuous to prevent through traffic, formed of straight, moderately winding,
curved, looped or angular streets. Tee-intersections shall predominate and cross-intersections
shall be minimized. There shall be an underlying systematic neighborhood pattern; however,
gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns should be avoided where possible. The street
pattern shall include extensions to the boundaries of the development to provide circulation
between adjoining neighborhoods.
4. Cul-de-sac Streets - provide direct access to properties from other streets. Ordinarily, a culde-
sac is a short street with only one outlet and having an appropriate terminal for safe and
convenient reversal traffic movement. Drainage should be towards the open end. If drainage
is toward the closed end it shall be conducted away in an underground storm sewer. Other
design alternatives such as through or looped streets shall be used where possible.
B. Minimum Street Standards - See Chart on page 39.
C. Supplementary Street Standards - In addition to the specific standards cited in Section B, the
following street standards shall apply to design and construction of streets:
1. Intersections
a. Streets shall be designed to intersect at right angles (90 degrees) and should be at right
angles for at least 100 feet from the point of cartway intersection.
b. No more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.
c. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide with any
existing intersections on the opposite side of the street. Where intersections cannot
practically be connected, a minimum of 150 feet shall separate the center lines of offset
local streets, and 400 feet minimum shall be provided for collector and major streets.
d. Street curb intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet for
local streets and thirty (30) feet for collector or major streets. The radius point shall be
concentric with that for the property lines.
37
e. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade. In hilly or rolling topography, a leveling
area shall be provided for seventy-five (75) feet on all sides preceding the intersection,
measured from the edge of cartway of the intersecting street. The leveling area shall have
a maximum grade of four percent (4 %) for local and cul-de-sac streets and a maximum
grade of two percent (2 %) for collector and major streets.
f. Clear sight triangles of seventy-five (75) feet measured along the center line from the
point of intersection, shall be provided and maintained at all intersections. No building,
structure, planting or other obstruction higher than 30" above the roadway grade shall be
permitted within the clear site triangle unless superseded by municipal zoning
regulations.

2. Street Names - shall not duplicate others nearby, and shall be subject to the approval of the
municipality. Street signs shall be erected to identify all streets.
3. Street Expansion - where a subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land or future development
phases sufficient streets shall be planned to extend to the boundary lines so that all parcels
may be subdivided and a coordinated street system obtained. Traffic circulation shall be
assured by installation of a temporary, stoned cul-de-sac for short term use (less than 2 years)
or paved cul-de-sac for longer use until a through street is completed.
4. Streets for Multi-family Development - shall be planned to connect with major or collector
streets to avoid generating large volumes of traffic on local residential streets.
5. Reserve Strips - the creation ofreserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed
street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street.
6. Right-of-way Widths - land for the right-of-way for the opening or extension of any street
within a subdivision shall be dedicated by the developer. Where a property abuts a street
which does not conform to the right-of-way width required by this Ordinance or other
ordinances of the municipality, the additional width necessary to meet current standards shall
be dedicated when such land is subdivided.
7. Vertical Curves - The minimum length of crest and sag vertical curves shall be determined
by multiplying the following "K" value by the percent change in grade for the curve
(expressed as a whole number):

Regardless of the vertical curve calculation, no street vertical curves shall be less than
seventy-five (75) feet in length.
8. Auxiliary Street Improvements - In addition to the required pavement and shoulder widths,
streets shall be designed and constructed with curbs, street lights, gutters, culverts, catch
basins, sidewalks, traffic control signs and other improvements required by municipal
ordinance or determined by the Planning Department to be necessary for a proposed
subdivision or land development. Specific improvement guidelines are:
40
a. Curbs - Vertical, slant and rolled curbs are all permissible designs, where permitted
by municipal regulation, functionally co-ordinated with the overall development
design, and constructed in accordance with the following:

minimum three (3) feet in width and shall be located between the curb line and
the sidewalk.
c. Traffic Control Signs - Signage within all subdivisions and land developments shall
be designed and installed by the developer in accordance with Penn DOT regulations
and MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices). Adequate vertical and
horizontal area shall be reserved for sign placement at intersections.
d. Street Lights - Street lights shall be designed and installed to illuminate all major
subdivisions and land developments, unless waiver is obtained for low density
developments or similar subdivisions. Street lights shall be placed at all street
intersections and accesses to land developments, within parking lots and along streets
at intervals of 250 feet or less.
e. Street Trees - Street trees shall be installed on both sides of all streets within
subdivisions and land developments. Installation shall be in accordance with the
following requirements:
L Trees shall be planted to avoid conflicts with utilities, roadways, sidewalks,
intersection visibility and street lights. Small, medium or large trees shall be
41
utilized where appropriate. Recommended tree species, by size, are listed
within this Ordinance appendix.
IL Plans proposing more than 25 lots or dwelling units shall be accompanied by a
detailed landscape plan.
m. Street tree planting between the street curb and sidewalk, within the grass

42
D. Unimproved Streets or Rights-of-Way - Subdivision on unimproved (unpaved) streets or access
rights-of-way is prohibited. However, in municipalities without prohibitive regulations, one lot
may access via an unimproved right-of-way provided that the right-of-way is a minimum of 50'
in width and so located and designed that a street could be installed in the event of future
subdivision activity.
E. Private Streets - Private streets are to be discouraged. They will be approved only if they are
designed and constructed to meet public street standards and maintenance is guaranteed in
perpetuity via a bonafide homeowner's association (or similar organization) agreement and
appropriate financial security for repair and maintenance. A minimum of 20 lots/units are
required if private street system is proposed.
Subdivision of new lots for immediate or future development is not permitted along private
lanes, alleys or streets which have not been designed, constructed and approved in accordance
with these standards and those of this Ordinance.
F. Street Construction Standards - Streets and rights-of-way shall be improved to meet township
and borough standards. The requirements contained herein are provided as design standards and
shall be used as improvement specifications in municipalities where no municipal standards exist
or to supplement standards of the municipalities. It shall be the developer's responsibility to
satisfy all applicable municipal construction requirements and design standards, or in lieu
thereof, deposit a security in compliance with Section 5.14 of this Ordinance and established
municipal policies. All public and private streets shall meet the following standards for design
and construction:
1. Excavation
a. All topsoil shall be removed from the area to be paved.
b. During construction, excavation shall be graded to drain.
2. Embankment
a. Placement of embankment shall be in layers not exceeding eight (8) inches, prior to
compaction.
b. Embankment material shall consist of all excavation on the project, except such materials
as may be determined to be unsuitable under Penn DOT Publication 408, current edition,
and when required will include borrow excavation.
3. Subgrade

cartway area prior to preparation of the sub grade. Trench backfilling shall be completed
in layers no greater than eight (8) inches.
b. Adequate surface and subsurface drainage shall be provided, including underdrains for
spnngs or spongy areas.
43
c. All large rocks, boulders or ledges shall be broken off six (6) inches below the improved
subgrade surface.
d. Completed subgrade shall be maintained and protected in advance of the succeeding
operation.
e. Disturbed areas shall be moistened as necessary to minimize dust.
4. Subbase
a. No sub base shall be placed on wet, frozen, or unsuitable material. Unsuitable material
such as sod, stumps, tree roots, spongy soil and excess rock shall be removed and
replaced. Disturbed areas shall be reshaped and recompacted. Where deemed necessary
by the County Engineer, a geotextile material may be required before placement of the
sub base.
b. The sub base shall be a stone aggregate material consisting of six (6) inches of compacted
2A or 3A modified stone under the paved surface of the cartway. A minimum of four (4)
inches of the same aggregate shall be installed on the shoulder of the road, extending at

Officials after the completion of each of the following phrases of street construction:
a. Preparation of the sub grade.
b. Placement and compaction of the subbase.
c. Installation of the base course.
d. Completion of the wearing course.
G. State Approval of Streets and Access - to insure that street designs comply with all applicable
standards, the Planning Department may submit any preliminary and final subdivision or land
development plans to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for review and comment.
Subdivision and land development plans which will require access to a state highway under the
jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (Penn DOT) shall contain a plan
note specifying that a highway occupancy permit is required from Penn DOT before driveway
access to the state highway is permitted. The plan note shall also specify that plan approval does
not guarantee that a Penn DOT permit will be issued.
H. Transportation Impact Studies (TISs) and Transportation Impact Assessments (TIAs)
A Transportation Impact Study (TIS) is required in conjunction with each subdivision or land
development plan which meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. The site is expected to generate 3,000 or more average daily trips or 1,500 vehicles per day.
2. During any one hour time period of any day of the week, the development is expected to
generate 100 or more vehicle trips entering the site or 100 or more vehicle trips exiting the
site.
3. For existing sites being redeveloped, the site is expected to generate 100 or more additional
trips entering or exiting the development during any one hour time period of any day of the
week.
4. In the opinion of the Lebanon County Planning Department (LCPD), the development or
redevelopment is expected to have a significant impact on highway safety and/or traffic flow,
even if none of the above warrants are met.
The LCPD is especially concerned about residential developments with one hundred (100) or
more lots or dwelling units and non-residential developments which will have more than one
hundred (100) employees, one hundred (100) parking spaces and/or more than twenty-five (25)
truck trips per day. These proposed developments warrant a scoping meeting as discussed below.
If a TIS is not warranted, the LCPD may require the preparation of a Transportation Impact
Assessment (TIA). Some of the factors in determining if a TIA is necessary include but are not
limited to:
45
1. Location of proposed access and site configuration,
2. Congestion and delay of the surrounding roadway network, and/or
3. Safety concerns.
The purpose of the TIA is to assess the impact of the development on specific intersections
and/or on elements of state and local roads. As such, the scope of the TIA will be limited and
targeted to the concerns of the LCPD, municipality or municipalities affected and/or the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (Penn DOT) if state roads (SRs) are involved. In
most cases, the TIA would be limited to an opening year analysis. It is critical that before any
work begins on a TIS or TIA, that the applicant meets with the LCPD, affected municipality or
municipalities, Penn DOT and/or other key parties in a scoping meeting in order to clarify and
agree upon the work to be performed and the time table for completion of the study or
assessment.
In determining the need for a TIS or TIA, the applicant should assume only one (1) access
point; however, major residential and commercial developments may require two (2) access
points. If the development has multiple stages or phases, the warrant for the TIS shall be based
on new trips generated at full build out of the development. The size of the study area for the TIS
or TIA may range from a one-half mile radius from the development out to several miles as
outlined in the Penn DOT requirements. The size of the study area and the roads/intersections
involved in the TIS/TIA will be established during the scoping meeting.
A TIS or TIA needs to balance the safety and mobility of the traveling public with the needs
and rights of property owners. Mitigating the impacts from development or redevelopment must
occur through the TIS or TIA process. The ultimate goal is to maintain a safe and efficient
transportation system and to enable growth and development/redevelopment where appropriate
and sustainable.
A TIS or a TIA must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified professional who
possesses a current Professional Engineer's (PE) license issued by the Pennsylvania Department
of State and preferably possessing a Professional Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE) certificate.
All TISs or TIAs in Lebanon County must comply with Penn DOT's standards for these types
of studies, as are outlined in Publication 170. If a Penn DOT highway occupancy permit (HOP)
is also needed, the applicant must also adhere to Penn DOT's HOP requirements as outlined in
Publication 282. The most current version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE's)
trip generation manual must also be used to calculate future trips. Where a Penn DOT HOP is
required along with a local/county land development process approval, both efforts should occur
in the same general time frame so that the HOP is approved by Penn DOT as the building permit
is issued by the municipality/county.
In general, in the urbanized portions of Lebanon County, the land developer or subdivider
shall be responsible for the off-site transportation improvements that are necessary to assure
Level of Service "D" conditions. In the rural portions of the county, Level of Service "C"
conditions must be met by the applicant. A copy of the Bureau of the Census' most current
urbanized area designations for Lebanon County can be obtained from the LCPD or Penn DOT.
46
SECTION 5.11 MONUMENTS
Sufficient monuments shall be set to ensure that reliable survey points are available for all parts
of the subdivision. At least one (1) monument shall be placed for every two (2) lots or every two
hundred (200) feet of streets, whichever requirement is less. The monument shall consist of a
concrete monument, 4" X 4" X 30", set level with finished grade. All lot corners and changes in
direction shall be identified with%" diameter X 15" steel bars.
The top of the monument box shall be set at the finished grade upon completion of the grading of
the street.
SECTION 5.12 UTILITIES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
All subdivisions shall be designed and serviced with adequate utilities, including electricity and
telephone service. The developer shall be responsible to cooperate with the utility companies to
insure installation of the necessary utilities. All utilities shall be underground, except where
developments of five (5) lots or less are exempted by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
Where required, the developer shall obtain a letter from the utility company confirming that service
may be extended to the development.
When required by the municipality, the developer shall provide a street lighting duct system, in
accordance with the specifications of the appropriate public utility.
In areas where public water lines are available, fire hydrants shall be installed by the developer.
Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 100 feet apart and within 500 feet of any dwelling or
inhabited structure. The nearest fire protection unit may be contacted for input regarding the design
and placement of a fire hydrant network.
SECTION 5.13 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
The land improvements required to be completed by the developer of a subdivision or land
development, as set forth in this Chapter, shall be designed and installed in accordance with this
Ordinance and other codes of the municipality. The improvements shall be of such size and
capacities as are required for the development of the proposed subdivision and of extra sizes as may
be necessary to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage
areas.
The developer shall be required to extend the improvements to serve adjoining unsubdivided
land. If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Planning
Department may require the developer to construct off-site extensions of the improvements.
Procedures for providing any necessary extra-size and off-site improvements and general standards
for pro-rating costs shall be coordinated with the municipality and shall be in accordance with the
following:
A. Extra-Size Improvements - The developer shall be required to pay for a part of the materials or
construction of streets, sewers or water lines which are determined by the Planning Department
and the municipality according to the standards set forth in this Chapter to be in excess of the
size required for the development of the subdivision and the integral neighborhood, service, or
drainage area.
47
If a storm sewer in excess of 18 inches, or a sanitary sewer in excess of 8 inches or a water
main in excess of 6 inches is required, but each less in size than the sewer trunk lines or water
mains which are to be constructed and financed on a regional basis, the municipality shall
construct the extra size utility and require a deposit in advance from the developer for the cost of
the utility he is required to install and his portion of other costs which the municipality may
assess against the benefited property owners of the service or drainage area.
B. Extensions to Boundaries - The developer shall be required to extend the improvements to the
boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land; however, where the
Department and/or the municipality determines that a connecting street is necessary for the
future subdividing of adjoining land, but the present construction of pavement and/or utilities
therein are not warranted, the Department and/or municipality may require the dedication of
land, the pavement intersections constructed, utilities extended at least three (3) feet beyond the
pavement, and connections provided and made available for future extensions by other
developers.
C. Off-Site Extensions - If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, the Planning Department and/or municipality may require as a precedence to
approval of a preliminary or final plan, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be
provided as follows:
1. If the Planning Department and/or municipality find the extensions across undeveloped areas
would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties or a municipal
expense until some future time, the developer may be required, if he wishes to proceed with
the development, to obtain necessary easements or rights-of-way and construct and pay for
extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by developers of
adjoining land, or
2. The municipality may construct and pay for the extensions and assess the costs to the owners
benefited and require a deposit from the developer as described in subsection (A) herein.
The municipality may establish a rotary fund to pay for such development costs and not
collect the assessments on the intervening land until it is developed.
D. Prorating Costs - In making determinations for prorating costs for the construction of off-site
extensions or extra-size improvements, the Planning Department and the municipality shall
consider in addition to the standards set forth in this Chapter and other regulations of the
municipality the following conditions:
I. The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision,
2. The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in relation to present streets,
3. The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for water,
4. The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision,
5. The sequence ofland and utility developments in the vicinity, and
6. Any other condition it may find pertinent.
48
SECTION 5.14 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE THEREOF
PREREQUISITE TO FINAL PLAN APPROVAL
A. Performance Guarantee in Lieu of Installation - No plat shall be finally approved unless the
streets shown on such plan have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be required by the subdivision and land development ordinance
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streets, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains,
sanitary sewers, storm sewers, storm water management facilities, required plantings, and other
improvements as may be required by the subdivision and land development ordinance have been
installed in accordance with this Ordinance. In lieu of the completion of any improvement
required as a condition for the final approval of a plat, the subdivider or developer shall deposit
with the municipality or county (depending upon type of improvement) a fiscal security in an
amount sufficient to cover the costs of any improvements or common amenities including, but
not limited to roads, storm water detention and/or retention basins and other related drainage
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be required.
B. Type of Guarantee - Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
municipality or county may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Federal
or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive
escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the
purposes of this Section. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial
security, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the Commonwealth. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to
the public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before the date
fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the
improvements.
C. Amount of Guarantee - The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cost of
completion estimated as of ninety (90) days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually the County may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing
the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for the
completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth (90th) day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the County may require the developer to post additional
security in order to assure that the financial security equals said one hundred and ten percent
(110%). Any additional security shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this
subsection. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost
of completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a qualified professional licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by
such qualified professional to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The County
Engineer shall review and approve the cost estimate or, for good cause, refuse to accept the
estimate.
If the party posting the financial security requires more than one (1) year from the date of
posting of the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial
49
security may be increased by an additional ten (10) percent of each year period beyond the first
anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding one hundred
and ten percent (110%) of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on
or about the expiration of the preceding one (1) year period by using the above cost estimate
preparation procedure. A developer who fails to complete the improvements within the allotted
time specified in the financial guarantee shall, at least sixty (60) days in advance of the guarantee
expiration date, renew or resubmit a financial guarantee. Failure to keep a financial guarantee in
effect until the completion and approval of all improvements shall be a violation of this
Ordinance.
D. Progressive Installation - In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Planning Department may authorize submission of final plats by phases of development subject
to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future phases of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved phase of the development.
E. Release from Guarantee - As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the release, from time to time, of such portions
of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be made in writing to the municipal governing body, or Planning
Department where applicable, and within forty-five ( 45) days of receipt of such request the
applicable municipal or county engineer, shall certify, in writing, to his employers whether or not
such portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved plat. When the improvements are certified to be in accordance with the approved plat,
the municipality or county shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution
of an amount as estimated by the municipal or county engineer fairly representing the value of
the improvements completed. If the municipality or county fails to act within said forty-five (45)
day period, the release of funds shall be deemed to have been approved as requested. The
municipality or county may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by
its engineer, require retention of ten percent ( 10%) of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvement.
The applicant shall assume the necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements. Such inspection costs shall be based upon a schedule established and amended
from time to time as deemed necessary.
F. Maintenance Guarantee - Where the municipality or county accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the municipality or county may require the
posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the
functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications depicted on
the final plat for a term not to exceed eighteen ( 18) months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this Section
with regard to installation of such improvements. The amount of financial security shall not
exceed fifteen (15) percent of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
G. Remedies to Effect Completion oflmprovements - In the event that any required improvements
have not been installed as provided in this Ordinance or in accordance with the approved final
plat, the municipality or county is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or
other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond, or other
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
50
improvements covered by said security, the municipality or county may, at its option, install part
of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute
appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder
of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal
or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation
of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other municipal or county
purpose. Failure to properly install the required improvements shall also constitute a violation of
this Ordinance, punishable as provided by Section 8.06 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 5.15 INSURANCE
The developer agrees to indemnify and save harmless the municipality and county against and
from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability, and expense on account of damage to property of, or
injury to or death of, the parties thereto or third person, caused by, growing out of, or in any way
whatsoever attributable to the construction of said improvements and the use of the street(s)
delineated on the subdivision plat during construction. The developer further agrees, but without
limiting its liability to indemnify the municipality or county, to carry liability insurance contracts
with a reliable insurance company covering the period of said construction in the sum of $500,000 to
$1 ,000,000 for injury to or death of person(s), and in the sum of $500,000 for damage to or
destruction of property, which insurance contracts shall include the municipality and county as
named insured.
SECTION 5.16 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY
A building or zoning permit may be issued and building construction started after the approval of
the final plat. Occupancy shall not be permitted prior to the completion of streets, storm water
management facilities and other improvements necessary for the reasonable use of the building,
unless written authorization is granted by the Planning Department where improvements have been
guaranteed by valid bond or other security.
51
CHAPTER 6 - PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION 6.01 INTENT
It is the intent of the Lebanon County Commissioners and the Planning Department to
provide for properly designed, constructed and maintained planned residential developments when
they are provided for in local municipal regulations. Flexible subdivision design concepts are
encouraged to meet the growing demand for a variety of housing types.
SECTION 6.02 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS
Planned residential developments are permitted only within municipalities with individual
planned residential development ordinances or separate planned residential development chapters
within their zoning ordinances, as per the following:
A. When a municipality has an individual planned residential development ordinance or a
zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned residential developments and they
also have a municipal subdivision and land development ordinance, the Planning
Department role during review shall be advisory, as identified by Act 247 and the
applicable municipal ordinance. A combined subdivision and zoning procedure may be
possible to allow comprehensive review and approval.
B. When a municipality has an individual planned residential development ordinance or a
zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned residential development but does not
have a municipal subdivision and land development ordinance, the Planning Department
shall review and approve or disapprove the plan based upon its compliance with this
Ordinance and the applicable municipal ordinances. Subdivision plan processing and
approval shall be in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Ordinance and such additional
procedures, hearings or requirements as the municipal ordinances may mandate.
C. When a municipality does not have an individual planned residential development
ordinance or a zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned residential
development, sites may not be subdivided or developed utilizing the planned residential
development concept or procedures.
SECTION 6.03 REVIEW AND APPROVAL
Upon receipt of planned residential development plans, the Planning Department shall begin
to review the plan for compliance with all applicable ordinance criteria and general planning
concepts. Plan review and approval or disapproval shall be subject to plan procedures described
within Chapter 3 and supplements thereto, as described within Section 6.02 of this Ordinance.
Compliance with all applicable municipal and county ordinances is required.
Furthermore, the following general planning concepts shall be applied during the review and
approval process for a planned residential development and may be utilized as criteria in the
evaluation of any planned residential development application:
52
A. Land shall be efficiently used; and
B. The design and layout shall be consistent with the character of the surrounding
neighborhood; and
C. Permitted non-residential buildings shall be a minor portion of the development and shall
be so located and grouped as to minimize impact on adjacent residential uses; and
D. Ownership, maintenance and management of the development project shall be fully
identified on the plan and within separate recorded documents to assure construction and
continuation of the project; and
E. Open space and recreation areas shall be well located and adequately serve the diverse
needs of the proposed residents; and
F. Although a mixture of housing types and design innovation are encouraged, plans shall
not contain extensive departure from standard design patterns unless more conventional
layout is determined to be impossible or inappropriate; and
G. The plan shall specify that all proposed buildings, community facilities, site
improvements and development amenities are to be constructed in accordance with the
approved plan and any development schedule approved therewith.
53
CHAPTER 7 - FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
SECTION 7.01 INTENT
The purpose of the regulations set forth in this Chapter is to monitor the subdivision and/or
development of flood plain areas in order to promote and protect the general health, welfare, and
safety of the community; to require that each subdivision lot in flood plain areas be provided with a
safe building site with adequate access; to insure that public facilities which serve such lots or
development can be designed and installed to preclude flood damage; and to protect individuals from
purchasing lands which are unsuitable for development because of flooding. The subsequent
sections shall be considered requirements supplemental to those procedures and standards specified
elsewhere in the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, the Lebanon County Stormwater
Ordinance, municipal zoning ordinances, the Uniform Construction Code (UCC), and any other
applicable ordinances and codes.
SECTION 7.02 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS UTILIZED IN THIS CHAPTER

H. Flood - A general and temporary inundation of normally dry land areas by water from waterway
overflows or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
I. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
J. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) -The official report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
K. Flood Plain Area - A relatively flat or low land area which is subject to partial or complete
inundation from an adjoining or nearby stream, river or watercourse; and/or any area subject to
the unusual and rapid accumulation of surface waters from any source.
L. Floodproofing - Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real

Al-30, AE, A99, or AH.
55
S. Start of Construction - Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development
and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within ninety (90)
days from the date of the permit and shall be completed within two (2) years after the date of
issuance of the permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading, and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main
structure. For a structure without a basement or poured footings, the "start of construction"
includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling
or foundation. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
T. Structure -A walled or roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank (principally above
ground), a manufactured home, or any other man-made object usually assembled of
interdependent parts or components which is designed to have a more or less fixed location,
whether or not permanently attached at that location.
U. Substantial Damage - Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
V. Substantial Improvement - Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the
structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures
which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however include any project for the improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of the state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions.
W. Uniform Construction Code (UCC)-The statewide building code adopted by The Pennsylvania
General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all municipalities whether by the
municipality, a third party, or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential
and commercial buildings. The Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard applicable with the
State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
X. Violation - Means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
§60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(IO), (d)(3), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided.
56
SECTION 7 .03 APP LI CA TIO NS PROCEDURES AND PLAT REQUIREMENTS
The following procedures shall be required in addition to those specified otherwise in these
regulations.
A. Pre-Application Procedures
1. It is suggested that prospective developers consult the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and the municipal Sewage Enforcement Officer concerning soil
suitability when on-site sewage disposal facilities are proposed.
2. Prospective developers shall consult the County Conservation District representative
concerning erosion and sediment control and the probable effect of geologic conditions on
the proposed development. Concurrently, a determination should be made as to whether or
not any flood hazards either exist or will be created as a result of the proposed subdivision or
development.
B. Preliminary Plan Requirements
The following information shall be required as part of the Preliminary Plan when a
subdivision is in a flood plain area and shall be prepared by a registered surveyor or licensed
engineer:
1. A map illustrating the location of the proposed subdivision or land development with respect
to the municipality's flood plain areas including information on, but not limited to, Base
Flood Elevations, boundaries of SFHA areas, proposed lots and sites, fill, and flood or
erosion protective facilities.
2. All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments shall provide base flood
delineations; however, subdivision proposals and other proposed new development greater
than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, shall include actual base flood elevation data. It
shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide the required base flood elevation data,
in a form comparable to HEC-2, which will be certified as accurate by a Registered
Professional Engineer.
3. Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or completely in the SFHA or
where the subdivision borders on the SFHA, the preliminary plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public utilities, and building
lots. All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two (2) feet and identify
accurately the boundaries of the SFHA.
C. Final Plan Requirements
The following information shall be required as part of the Final Plan and shall be prepared by
a registered engineer or surveyor:
1. All information required for submission of the Preliminary Plan plus any changes required by
the Planning Department and/or the local municipal governing body.
57
2. A map showing the exact location and elevation of all proposed buildings, structures, roads,
and public utilities to be constructed in the SFHA. All such maps shall show contours at
intervals of two (2) feet and identify accurately the boundaries of the SFHA.
SECTION 7.04 DESIGN STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS
The design standards and improvements specified herein shall be considered requirements in
addition to those of Chapter 5 and otherwise listed in this Ordinance and in addition to the Lebanon
County Stormwater Ordinance.
A. General
1. Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land located in the SFHA may
be platted for development with the provision that the developer construct all buildings and
structures to preclude flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
2. Building sites for residences or any other type of dwellings or accommodations and building
sites for structures or buildings other than residential uses shall be permitted in the flood
plain only when in compliance with appropriate municipal zoning ordinances, the
Uniform Construction Code, and any other applicable regulations.
3. If the Planning Department and/or the local municipality determine that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, they shall limit development to that part and shall
require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
4. When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the Planning Department
and/or the local municipality determine that additional controls are required to insure safe
development, they may require the developer to impose appropriate deed restrictions on the
land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
5. Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a watercourse within the designated SFHA,
a permit shall be obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of
Dams, Waterways and Wetlands. Also adjacent communities, the Department of Community
and Economic Development, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
must be notified. Additionally, the municipality must be assured that the flood carrying
capacity of an altered or relocated watercourse will be maintained by the developer.
6. No new construction or development shall be located within a designated floodway. Where
the floodway has not been specifically identified for a stream or waterway, no new
construction or development shall be permitted within the stream channel (from top of bank
to top of bank). Furthermore, construction or development outside the stream banks but
within the SFHA shall be permitted only when in compliance with this Ordinance and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection permit requirements.
7. Lots which are within the SFHA shall be subject to the following:
a. Any lots created or revised shall have not more than 50% of their area within the flood
plain, except that lots may be exempted provided the minimum lot size established by the
58
applicable zoning district or 1 acre, whichever is less, is provided outside the SFHA.
b. Lot access to a public road shall not be restricted or prevented by the SFHA.
B. Excavation, Grading and Use of Fill
Any excavation activities, grading and use of fill shall be in compliance with all applicable
terms of the municipal zoning ordinance and the Uniform Construction Code. Furthermore,
where excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing trees, shrubs or other vegetative
cover will be removed, the developer shall consult the County Conservation District
representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and to also obtain a report on
the soil characteristics of the site so that determination can be made as to the type and degree of
development the site may accommodate. Before undertaking any excavation or grading, the
developer shall obtain a Grading and Excavation Permit if such is required by the municipality.
C. Drainage Facilities
Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface water without
damage to persons or property. The system shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and
provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-site disposal sites.
Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Department. The Planning Department
may also require a primarily underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a
secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be
designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
D. Streets
The finished excavation of proposed streets shall be no more than two (2) feet below the
Base Flood Elevation. The Planning Department may require, where necessary, profiles and
elevations of streets to determine compliance with this requirement. Drainage and bridge
openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
E. Sewer Facilities
All sanitary sewer systems located in the SFHA, whether public or private, shall be
floodproofed to a point two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
1. The Planning Department may prohibit installation of sewage disposal facilities requiring
soil absorption systems where such systems will not function due to high ground water,
flooding, or unsuitable soil characteristics. The Planning Department may require that the
developer note on the face of the plat and in any deed of conveyance that soil absorption
fields are prohibited in designated areas.
2. The Planning Department may prescribe adequate methods for waste disposal. If a sanitary
sewer system is located on or within 1000 feet of the proposed subdivision and/or land
development, the Planning Department and/or the local municipality shall require the
developer to provide sewage facilities to connect to this system where practical, and shall
prescribe the procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
59
F. Water Facilities
All water systems located in flood plain areas, whether public or private, shall be
floodproofed to a point two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation. If there is an existing
public water supply system on or near the subdivision, the Planning Department and/or the local
municipality shall require the developer to connect to this system where practical, and shall
prescribe the procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
G. Other Public and/or Private Utilities and Facilities
All other public and/or private utilities and facilities shall be elevated or floodproofed to a
point two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
SECTION 7.05 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
No final plat shall be approved by the Planning Department and the local municipality until
the improvements required by this Ordinance are completed in a satisfactory manner and approved
by the local municipality and the Planning Department. In lieu of such construction, approval may
be granted prior to completion providing:
A. The developer enters into an agreement with the county guaranteeing that improvements will be
installed in accordance with the plans, specifications, and schedules approved by the
municipality prior to plat approval. This agreement shall also guarantee that no lot will be sold
or building constructed in any SFHA prior to completion of all protective works or measures
planned for such lot and necessary access to facilities; and
B. The developer provides a fiscal surety to guarantee performance of this agreement and
completion of the improvements as planned. The surety may include an escrow account,
irrevocable letter of credit or other bond acceptable to the municipality. The procedural
requirements of Section 5.14 of this Ordinance shall apply to any such bonding proposal.
SECTION 7.06 MUNICIPAL LIABILITY
The grant of a permit or approval of a subdivision and/or land development plan in the
identified SFHA shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the
County or by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and
shall create no liability upon the municipality, its officials or employees.
60

LEBANON COUNTY MODEL ACCESS
MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE SUMMARY
The Lebanon County Planning Department (LCPD) has developed the attached Access
Management Ordinance in order to balance mobility and accessibility. Mobility refers to the
movement of traffic; while accessibility refers to the ability of traffic to enter and exit a roadway
from adjacent properties. The major benefits of access management ordinances are improved public
safety and reduced traffic congestion. Well thought out and easy to understand access management
ordinances also benefit the business community, governmental agencies,
communities/neighborhoods, and pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and motorists.
The Lebanon County Model Access Management Ordinance includes twenty four different
sections (A through X) dealing with purpose, application of regulations, definitions, non-conforming
driveways, relationship to PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permits, number of driveways, access to
roadways, driveway radius, driveway throat width, driveway throat length, driveway profile,
driveway channelizing islands, driveway location, safe sight distance, driveway spacing, comer
clearance, joint and cross access, driveway clearance from interchange ramps, internal access to
parcels, pedestrian connections, signalized intersection spacing, right tum I deceleration lane, left
tum lane, and extension of service roads. Tables and figures are provided for ease of use.
The Model Access Management Ordinance will be used by the Lebanon County Planning
Department when it reviews applications for subdivision and land development approval or for
building permits for lots with frontage on arterial or major collector roadways within Lebanon
County that are under the jurisdiction of the Lebanon County Planning Department for the above
mentioned activities.
A. Purpose
This access management ordinance is intended to promote safe and efficient traffic flow on higher
order roadways within the County of Lebanon, while protecting the rights of abutting landowners to
reasonable street access. By reducing the potential for crashes at access points along the corridor
and avoiding future degradation of roadway capacity, this access management ordinance serves to
promote the public health, safety and welfare of the people of the County of Lebanon.
B. Application of Regulations
This ordinance shall pertain to all applications for subdivision and land development approval, or
building permit, for lots with frontage along roadways classified as arterial or major collector
roadways within Lebanon County that are under the jurisdiction of the Lebanon County Planning
Department (Planning Department) for subdivision, land development, or building permit activities.
The Planning Department may grant a modification of the requirements of this ordinance if the
Planning Department concludes that the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modifications will not be
contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance is observed.
Except for those criteria found within this ordinance, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) criteria as found in Pennsylvania Code 441 shall govern the design of intersections of
arterial and major collector roadways with private driveways and with other public roadways.
70
C. Definitions
Access point - the location of the intersection of a highway, street or driveway with another
highway.
ADT Volume- Average Daily Traffic volume, or the number of vehicles passing a single point on a
roadway in a 24-hour period adjusted by day of the week and monthly factors.
Band width - the time elapsed between the passing of the first and last possible vehicles moving at
the design speed through a coordinated traffic signal system. Band width is expressed as a
percentage of the signal cycle in which vehicles on the major street receive a green indication.
Cross access driveway - a service driveway providing vehicular access between two or more
contiguous sites so that the driver need not re-enter the public street system.
Curbline opening - the overall opening dimension at the curbline measured between the points of
tangency of the driveway radii if curbing exists or the maximum width of opening at the
curb line/edge of the roadway if curbing does not exist.
Driveway - every entrance or exit used by vehicular traffic to or from properties abutting a public
street or road. This term does not include proposed streets.
Driveway radius - the radius of the curb or pavement at the intersection of the public roadway and
the driveway.
Driveway throat - the section of a driveway between the highway right of way and the first internal
intersecting driveway within the site.
High volume driveway - a driveway used or expected to be used by more than 1,500 vehicles per
day.
Joint access driveway - a driveway connecting two or more contiguous sites to the public street
system.
Low volume driveway - a driveway used or expected to be used by more than 25 but less than 750
vehicles per day.
Medium volume driveway - a driveway used or expected to be used by more than 750 but less than
1,500 vehicles per day.
Minimum use driveway - a residential or other driveway which is used or expected to be used by not
more than 25 vehicles per day.
Peak hour volume - the numbers of vehicles passing a single point during one hour during a defined
peak period of a day, usually the morning or evening commuter peak or the Saturday shopping peak.
71
PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) - the permit issued by PennDOT to approve any
construction, including driveways, within all PennDOT rights of way.
Service road - a road that runs parallel to a higher-speed road, and which provides access to all
abutting land uses. The service road feeds the higher speed road at appropriate points of access.
D. Non-Conforming Driveways
Driveways that do not conform to the regulations in this ordinance, and were constructed before the
adoption of this ordinance, shall be considered legal nonconforming driveways. However,
nonconforming driveway(s) shall be reconstructed to comply with this ordinance if there is a change
in use or intensity of the land use, such that the use of the access increases peak hour or ADT
volume by 10 percent or more and by 100 daily trips, based on the latest edition of Trip Generation
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or upon other data approved by the County
Engineer or County Planning staff.
E. Relationship to PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit
Issuance of a PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) does not guarantee site plan approval by
the County nor does it deem the plan in conformance with this ordinance. The HOP submittal to
PennDOT should not occur before approval to do so by the County. However, upon request of the
applicant or request of the County, PennDOT may be brought into the County review process to
reconcile site design and access issues.
F. Number of Driveways
1. One driveway shall be permitted per property. Additional driveways shall be permitted if the
applicant demonstrates that:
a) The design is in the best interest of efficient traffic operations on the site, including but
not limited to reducing delays at a single access point that would otherwise operate at
worse than a Level of Service 'C' in rural areas and Level of Service 'D' in urban areas,
and can improve safety; and,
b) The frontage of the property is sufficient to permit multiple driveways in accordance with
the spacing requirements of Section 0.
c) All driveways on one property shall be interconnected with an internal roadway network.
G. Access to Roadways
For properties that abut two or more roadways, the County may restrict access to only one roadway,
if all movements can be efficiently and safely accommodated on that roadway and if doing so serves
the goal of managing the number of access points and thus better maintains mobility on the restricted
roadway. For properties fronting a state roadway and local roadway, access can be restricted to the
local roadway notwithstanding the ability to receive a Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) from
PennDOT for access to the state roadway.
H. Driveway radius
1. Following are the minimum and maximum driveway radii (in feet), as related to the posted
speeds on the accessed street. Table H. l pertains to land uses with infrequent service by
buses and combination trucks (5% or less of volume). Table H.2 pertains to land uses which
are regularly serviced by buses and combination trucks (more than 5% of volume).

minimum driveway radius provided.
3. Not withstanding any of the above, the applicant shall prepare a truck circulation plan to
document that the largest truck that will regularly service the site can be accommodated by
the site circulation design and the access design.
I. Driveway throat width
1. Minimum and maximum dimensions for the width of driveways in the throat are provided
below. Driveways shall be designed such that the opening at the curbline is no larger than
necessary. The maximum desirable curbline opening shall be 50 feet.
2. The dimensions in the table assume one lane in each direction; engineering judgment should
be used to determine appropriate dimensions for multi-lane driveways.
One-way Two-way
Min. 10 feet 20 feet
Max. 24 feet 28 feet
J. Driveway throat length
Following is the minimum length of driveways from the public street to an internal driveway or
intersection:
Driveway Length
Minimum use 25 feet
Low volume 50 feet
Medium volume 120 feet
High volume 150 feet
An illustration of driveway radius, width and length is provided in the Appendix, Figure 1.
73
K. Driveway profile
Driveway grade requirements where curb is not present on the intersecting street:
1 . The change in grade between the cross-slope of the connecting roadway or shoulder and the
driveway shall not exceed 8%.
2. The driveway grade shall not exceed 8% within 10 ft. of the travel lane for minimum use
driveways and within 40 ft. for low, medium and high volume driveways.
3. A 40-foot minimum vertical curve shall be used for a high volume driveway.
Driveway grade requirements where curbs and sidewalks are present:
1. The difference between the cross slope of the roadway and the grade of the driveway apron
may not exceed 8%.
2. The driveway grade shall not exceed 8% within 10 feet of the travel lane for minimum use
driveways and within 40 feet for low, medium and high volume driveways.

side of the sidewalk may be depressed to enable the driveway grade to stay within 8%.
4. The sidewalk cross slope shall be no greater than 1/4 inch per foot. If the sidewalk cross
slope exceeds 1/4 inch per foot, the entire sidewalk may be depressed. The longitudinal
grade of the sidewalk may not exceed 2 inches per foot.
*An illustration of driveway profile is provided in the Appendix, Figure 2.
L. Driveway Channelizing Islands
1. Where it is found necessary to restrict particular turning movements at a driveway due to the
potential disruption to the orderly flow of traffic or as a result of sight distance constraints,
the County Planning staff may require a raised channelization island.
2. Raised channelization islands shall be designed with criteria consistent with the latest edition
of the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials)
publication, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
M. Driveway Location
Driveways shall be located directly across from a public roadway or private driveway on the
opposite side of an undivided roadway where feasible. If it is not possible to align driveways on
opposite sides, the centerlines of access points should be offset by at least 150 feet. In no case shall
left turns into the driveway be made across a left tum lane serving another driveway or street on the
opposite side of the roadway.
N. Safe Sight Distance
1. Safe sight distance shall be available for all permitted turning movements at all driveways,
and shall be documented on the site plans.
2. Pennsylvania Code Chapter 441, "Access to and Occupancy of Highways by Driveways and
Local Roads," and PennDOT Pub. 70, "Guidelines for the Design of Local Roads and
Streets," shall be referenced to determine minimum driveway and roadway intersection safe
sight distance requirements.
3. All driveways and intersecting roadways shall be designed and located so that the sight
distance is optimized to the degree possible without jeopardizing other requirements such as
intersection spacing.
*An illustration of sight distance is provided in the Appendix, Figure 3.
74
0. Driveway Spacing
1. Driveway spacing is measured from the center of one driveway to the center of the next
driveway, along the same side of the roadway.
2. The following driveway spacing standards are to be followed for arterial roadways and major
collector roads:
Posted Speed Minimum
(mph) Spacing (feet)
30 200
35 250
40 300
45 360
50 425
55 490
3. If these driveway spacing standards cannot be met, a system of joint or cross access
driveways, frontage roads or service roads may be required.
4. All driveways shall be located outside the limits of deceleration and acceleration lanes
serving the adjacent driveway or intersection. The County Engineer, County Planning staff
or PennDOT may require acceleration and deceleration lanes of adjacent driveways to be
connected to form an auxiliary lane.
5. Pre-existing lots in residential zoning districts, which do not have sufficient lot frontage to
meet the above driveway spacing standards, are permitted to install one driveway to serve
single-family homes approved for construction.
P. Corner Clearance
1. Driveways on arterial and collector roadways shall meet the following spacing standards
from intersecting roadways:
Posted Speed Minimum
(mph) Spacin2 (feet)
30 200
35 250
40 300
45 360
50 425
55 490
2. If minimum corner clearance standards cannot be achieved due to constraints, the following
shall apply in all cases:
a. The driveway shall be sited as far from the comer as possible.
b. The County may require tum restrictions at the driveway if the County Engineer or
County Planning staff determines that the location of the driveway and particular ingress
or egress movements will create safety or operational problems.
c. The County may require installation of joint or cross access driveways, or frontage or
service roads.
75
Q. Joint and Cross Access
1. The County may require a joint or cross access driveway in order to achieve the driveway
spacing standards of Section 0 and the comer clearance standards of Section P, or on any
property when possible in order to maintain efficient traffic flow on the abutting public
roadway.
a. The County shall waive this requirement if installing a joint or cross access driveway
is not possible. In such cases, the property owner shall sign an agreement to close the
permitted driveway and to seek to establish a joint or cross access driveway, if
possible, when an adjoining property is developed or redeveloped.
2. Documentation that a joint or cross access driveway is not possible may include, but is not
limited to:
a. Documentation that a good faith offer to develop a joint or cross access driveway was
presented to adjacent property owners, but was declined;
b. Topographical conditions or other natural features, or insufficient front yard, that
make it impracticable to develop joint or cross access.
3. If a joint or cross access is developed, the property owners shall:
a. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties
served by the driveway.
b. Record a joint agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of the
property owners along the driveway.
c. Record an agreement with the municipality so that future access rights along the
driveway are granted at the discretion of the municipality.
R. Driveway Clearance from Interchange Ramps
1. A driveway shall not be permitted on or within an interchange ramp, including the
acceleration or deceleration lane.
2. A driveway shall not be permitted within 100 feet in areas classified as urban by PennDOT
or 300 feet in areas classified as rural by PennDOT from either the end or beginning of a
ramp radius.
S. Internal Access to Outparcels
For commercial and office developments comprised of more than one building site and under the
same ownership and consolidated for the purposes of development, the County shall require that the
development, including all outparcels, be served by an internal road that is separated from the main
roadway. Outparcel access shall demonstrate safe, efficient ingress and egress and avoid queuing
across other driveways and parking aisles.
T. Pedestrian Connections
Land uses generating more than 750 trips per day shall provide pedestrian connections from their
side or rear yards to adjoining land uses when possible. The intent of this section is to shorten
pedestrian trips between abutting major pedestrian generators, such as shopping centers and multifamily
residential developments. This requirement may be waived for connections between major
pedestrian generators and properties with single-family and two-family residences. These direct
pedestrian connections shall be provided in addition to the installation of sidewalks along the front
of the property.
76
U. Signalized Intersection Spacing
1. The following table indicates minimum spacmg (in feet) for traffic signals for efficient
vehicular progression:
Cycle Speed (mph)
length 25 30 35 40 45 50 55
(sec.)
60 1,100 1,320 1,540 1,760 1,980 2,200 2,430
70 1,280 1,540 1,800 2,050 2,310 2,500 2,640
80 1,470 1,760 2,050 2,350 2,640 2,640 2,640

150 2,640 2,640 2,640 2,640 2,640 2,640 2,640
a. Warrants for the signalization of an intersection shall be justified by PennDOT Pub.
201M, Engineering and Traffic Studies, with County and municipal concurrence, through
a formal municipal resolution to maintain and operate the traffic signal in accordance
with the Permit issued by PennDOT.
2. The location of a traffic signal shall result in a minimum band width percentage as indicated
in the following table:
Roadway Function Minimum Acceptable Band Width
Principal Arterial 50 percent
Minor Arterial 40 percent
Collector and Local 30 percent
3. The study area for the band width analysis shall include the traffic signal to either side of the
proposed signal, and all traffic signals within the coordinated traffic signal system, if a
coordinated system exists or is proposed.
4. A waiver from these signal spacing standards may be given to arterial or collector roadways
that serve as the main street of a mixed use business district with a traditional grid street
network. In these areas, signal spacing of one block length with a minimum of 300 feet may
be acceptable, with no minimum bandwidth.
V. Right Turn/ Deceleration Lane
1. Development projects shall require a right tum deceleration lane on the major road at an
unsignalized intersection under all of the following conditions:
a. When the posted speed on the road is greater than 40 mph;
b. The road has average daily traffic volumes of 5,000 or more; and
c. There are 40 or more right turns in the peak hour.
2. Following are the minimum deceleration lengths on roadways with a grade of 2% or less.
These lengths include both the taper and the full-width deceleration lane:
Speed (mph) Deceleration Length (feet)
35 220
40 275
45 360
50 425
55 510
77
a. For roads with grades greater than 2%, the deceleration lengths shall be multiplied by
the following factors:
Slope Upgrade Downgrade
3%to4% .9 1.2
5% to 6% .8 1.35
3. Deceleration lanes are not required on roadways with a posted speed of 40 mph or less;
however, where deceleration lanes are installed on such roadways, they should be at least the
length indicated in the table.
4. Where the width of the roadway right-of-way is insufficient to permit construction of the
right turn/ deceleration lane, the property owner shall provide any necessary right-of-way.
Where the lot frontage is insufficient to permit installation of a deceleration lane of the
recommended length, the property owner may be requested to set back the front curb for the
length of the property if development on the adjacent property is eventually anticipated.
An illustration of a deceleration lane is provided in the Appendix, Figure 4.
W. Left Turn Lane
Signalized intersections shall require the installation of a left-tum lane when a capacity analysis
indicates that the operation of an intersection, approach, or movement will operate at Levels of
Service 'E' or 'F' and the operation of the intersection, approach or movement can be improved with
the installation of one or more left tum lanes.
X. Extension of Service Roads
The municipality and/or county may require developers to extend a service roadway through the
subject property when doing so will result in fewer trips directly accessing the higher order roadway.

EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION POLLUTION CONTROL GUIDELINES
INTRODUCTION
Pennsylvania law requires an Erosion and Sedimentation Pollution Control (E & SPC) plan
be developed and implemented for all earthmoving activities. The following guidelines are to be
incorporated into an E & SPC plan for projects that do not have an existing plan. The guidelines
alone do not constitute a complete plan. The E & SPC plan must be fully developed and site
specific in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 102 rules
and regulations. Additional information regarding E & SPC development and Chapter 102
regulations may be obtained from the County Conservation District.
PROCEDURE
The following list of E & SPC guidelines shall be used as standard subdivision and land
development plan notes on all plans. Major subdivision and land development plans also require site
specific E & SPC design sheets and details.
GUIDELINES
1. A logical construction sequence shall be developed that includes the installation of E & SPC
facilities, and Best Management Practices (BMP's), before earthmoving may commence.
2. E & SPC facilities and BMP's shall be correctly installed and maintained. Maintenance
information and construction details may be obtained from the County Conservation District.
3. Earth disturbance shall take place within a defined limit of disturbance and immediately prior to
construction.
4. Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, minimize land cuts and fills and
conform to the general topography. Plans shall be designed and implemented so as to create the
least potential for erosion and to adequately contain the volume and reduce the velocity of
surface water runoff.
5. Natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented prior to and during
construction.
6. Topsoil shall be removed from construction areas and stockpiled for final grading and seedbed
preparation. Downslope areas of any stockpiles, construction or borrow areas shall be protected
with correctly installed and maintained silt fence, straw bales or sediment traps prior to any earth
disturbance in order to minimize sediment laden runoff.
7. All cuts and fills shall be brought to final grade early in the construction sequence, and stabilized
immediately with seed and mulch.
85
8. Only driveway excavations that can be stabilized with a crushed stone base the same day shall be
completed.
9. Current regulations state: (a) Upon completion of an earth disturbance activity or any stage or
phase of an activity, the site shall be immediately seeded, mulched or otherwise protected from
accelerated erosion and sedimentation. (b) Erosion and sediment control BMP 's shall be
implemented and maintained until the permanent stabilization is completed. (c) For an earth
disturbance activity or any stage or phase of an activity to be considered permanently stabilized,
the disturbed areas shall be covered with one of the following: (1) A minimum uniform 70%
perennial vegetative cover, with a density capable of resisting accelerated erosion and
sedimentation. (2) An acceptable BMP which permanently minimizes accelerated erosion and
sedimentation.
10. The Penn State Erosion Control & Conservation Plantings on Noncropland guide or Agronomy
guide shall be consulted for permanent and temporary seeding and mulching types and rates.
(Straw mulch shall be applied at a rate of at least 3 tons per acre or 5 bales per 1000 square feet.
Slopes steeper than 3: 1 shall be correct! y lined with appropriate turf reinforcement matting.)
Other helpful publications include Tur/grass Establishment (special Circular 163), Tur/grass
Seed and Seed Mixtures (extension circular 391), and Principles of Tur/grass Irrigation (special
circular 158). The publications referenced are available from the Penn State Extension Office.
11. All recycling and disposal of construction waste shall be in accordance with local and state rules
and regulations for waste management. Construction waste includes but is not limited to:
Excess soil and rock, building materials, concrete and concrete wash water, sanitary waste and
any other materials that could adversely impact surface or ground water quality.
Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) Standard Notes
PCSM Requirements
A licensed professional or a designee shall be present onsite and be responsible during
critical stages of implementation of the approved PCSM Plan. The critical stages may
include the installation of underground treatment or storage BMPs, structurally engineered
BMPs or other BMPs as deemeo appropriate by the Department or the conservation district.
The PCSM Plan, inspection reports, and monitoring records shall be available for review and
inspection by the Department or the conservation district.
PCSM Long Term Operations and Maintenance Requirements
The permittee or co-permittee shall be responsible for long-term operation and maintenance
of PCSM BMPs unless a different person 1s identified in the notice of termination and has
agreed to long-term operation and maintenance of PCSM BMPs.
A_permittee or co-permittee that fails to transfer long-term operation and maintenance of the
PCSM BMP or otlierwise fails to comply with this requirement shall remain jointly and
severally responsible with the landowner for long-term operation and maintenance of the
PCSM BMPs located on the property.
Permit Termination
Upon permanent stabilization of the earth disturbance activity and installation of BMPs in
accordance with an approved plan, the permittee or co-Rermittee shall submit a notice of
termination to the Departmenf or conservation district. The notice of termination must
include:
(1) The facility name, address and location
(2) The operator name and address
86
(3) The NPDES permit number
(4) The reason for permit termination
