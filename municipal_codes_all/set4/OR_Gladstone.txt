For the purpose of GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100, the following definitions apply:

(1) City Infractions. An offense against the city in the form of a violation of one of the city ordinances or section thereof designated in GMC Section 1.08.030, constitutes a city infraction and shall be handled in accordance with the procedures established by GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100. When an infraction is of a continuing nature, a separate infraction will be deemed to occur on each calendar day the infraction continues to exist and a separate citation may be filed for each such infraction.

(2) Forfeiture—Forfeiture Schedule. The only penalty to be imposed for an infraction is a monetary penalty called a forfeiture. The Gladstone Municipal Court shall, however, possess the additional enforcement powers set forth in GMC Section 1.08.080. The appropriate forfeiture to be assessed for a specific infraction will be determined from the forfeiture schedule in GMC Section 1.08.090. The procedure prescribed by GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100 shall be the exclusive procedure for imposing forfeiture; however, this section shall not be read to prohibit in any way any other alternative remedy set out in ordinances covered by this infraction procedure which is intended to abate or alleviate ordinance violations, nor shall the city be prohibited from recovering, in a manner prescribed by law, any expense incurred to it in abating or removing ordinance violations pursuant to said ordinances.

(3) “Person” as used in GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100 shall be construed to include any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association of persons.

1.08.055 Civil infraction summons and complaint service—Failure to receive—Default.

(1) Service of the civil infraction summons and complaint may be made by personal service on the respondent or an agent for the respondent, by substitute service at the respondent’s dwelling or office; by affixing to the main door of the property or premises, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the respondent at his last known address.

Service at the respondent’s office must be made during regular business hours to the person who is apparently in charge. If substitute service is used, a true copy of the summons and complaint, together with a statement of the date, time and place at which service was made, must be mailed to the respondent at the respondent’s last known address. Service will be considered complete upon such a mailing. Service by any other method reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise the respondent of the existence and pendency of the infraction and to afford a reasonable opportunity to respond shall be acceptable.

(2) Service on particular respondents, such as minors, incapacitated persons, corporations, limited partnerships, the state, other public bodies and general partnerships shall be as prescribed for the service of a civil summons and complaint by the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.

(3) No default shall be entered against any respondent without proof that the respondent had notice of the civil infraction summons and complaint. A sworn affidavit of the Code Enforcement Officer outlining the method of service, including the date, time and place of service shall create a rebuttable presumption that the respondent had such notice.

Statutory Reference: ORS 153.110 to 153.310.

History: Ord. 1393, 2007.


1.08.060 Infraction procedure—Answer to summons.

(2) If a person alleged to have committed an infraction admits the infraction or otherwise desires to pay the forfeiture without appearing in Municipal Court, he may complete the appropriate answer on the back of each summons and forward the summons to the Municipal Court. A check or money order in the amount of the forfeiture for the infraction alleged as shown on the face of the summons shall also be submitted with the answer.

(3) If the person alleged to have committed the infraction denies part or all of the infraction, he may request a hearing by completing the appropriate answer on the back of the summons and forwarding the summons to the Municipal Court. Upon receipt, the answer shall be entered and a hearing date established by the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court shall notify the person alleged to have committed the infraction by mail, of the date of the hearing.

(1) Every hearing to determine whether an infraction has occurred shall be held before the Municipal Court without a jury.

(2) The hearing shall be limited to production of evidence only on the infraction alleged in the complaint.

(a) Oral Evidence. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation;

(b) Hearsay Evidence. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state;

(c) Admissibility of Evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state.

(d) Exclusion of Evidence. Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

(3) The defendant shall have the right to present evidence and witnesses in his favor, to cross-examine witnesses who testify against him and to submit rebuttal evidence.

(4) The defendant may be represented by counsel, but counsel shall not be provided at public expense. If defense counsel is to appear, written notice shall be provided to the Municipal Court ten days prior to the hearing date, excluding weekends and holidays.

(5) The city shall have the burden of proving the alleged ordinance infraction by a preponderance of the evidence.

(6) After due consideration of the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing, the court shall determine whether the infraction as alleged in the complaint has been established. When the infraction has not been established, an order dismissing the complaint shall be entered in the Municipal Court records. When a determination is made that an infraction has been established or if an answer admitting the infraction has been received, or the forfeiture otherwise paid by the defendant, an appropriate order shall be entered in the Municipal Court records.

(7) Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, upon a finding that an infraction has occurred, the court shall assess a forfeiture not to exceed the maximum permissible forfeiture for the specific infraction established in accordance with GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100 plus court costs.

(8) There shall be no administrative appeal or legal review from a determination by the Municipal Court of an infraction violation.

(1) If a cited person fails to answer the summons or to appear at a scheduled hearing as provided in GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100, the Municipal Court may enter a default judgment for the scheduled forfeiture applicable to the charged infraction. Upon entering a default judgment, the court shall notify the defendant by regular mail at the address given by the defendant at the time of being issued the citation that the defendant has thirty (30) days to arrange with the court clerk to pay the forfeiture or warrant may be issued for the defendant’s arrest. Warrants may be issued by the court as well as in infraction matters if the defendant (1) fails to appear for a scheduled trial or (2) fails to comply with any other order of the court.

(2) After a hearing and determination by the Municipal Court that an infraction has occurred, the court shall assess a forfeiture not to exceed the maximum permissible forfeiture for the specific infraction established in accordance with GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100 plus court costs.

(3) Delinquent forfeitures and those brought to default judgment which were assessed for infractions occurring on real property or for improper use of real property may be held as city liens against said real property and collected in the same manner as other such debts owing to the city.

(4) Nothing in this section shall limit the city from revoking or denying any city license or permit held or desired by a person owing a forfeiture to the city.

(5) Nothing in GMC Sections 1.08.010 through 1.08.100 shall limit the inherent power of the Municipal Court to impose criminal penalties for contempt of court in cases where it deems such sanctions appropriate.

5.06.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of certain types of adult business activities that the council finds present an extraordinary risk of being utilized to facilitate and conceal criminal conduct including offenses involving prostitution, controlled substances, theft, gambling, fraud, obscenity and often involving organized, systematic criminal activities. Therefore, this chapter is intended to minimize such risk by providing for the strict regulation of such business activities and by prohibiting those persons who have previously been involved in such criminal conduct from participating in such business activities. In making this determination, the council has specifically considered the impact that such regulations will have upon the competitive nature of such business activities, and finds that the need for such regulations outweighs such impact.

5.40.011 Purpose.

The purpose of this Chapter is to strictly regulate certain business activities that present an extraordinary risk of being used to conceal criminal behavior, including the theft of property. This risk is present despite the best effort of legitimate businesses, because these businesses process large volumes of goods and materials that are frequently the subject of theft. This Chapter is intended to reduce this type of criminal activity by providing more timely police awareness of such property transactions, and by regulating the conduct of persons engaged in this business activity. The need for these regulations outweighs any noncompetitive effect that may result from their adoption.

Booking services include directly or indirectly accepting, receiving or facilitating payment, whether or not the person or entity is the ultimate recipient of the payment, including through application programming interfaces (APIs) or other computerized devices where third-party providers receive information about a transaction and collect funds for the transient lodging occupancy from an occupant.

“Host” means the owner or person who resides at the short-term rental or has been designated by the owner or resident of the short-term rental and who rents out the short-term rental for transient lodging occupancy either directly or through the use of a hosting platform.

“Hosting platform” means a person or entity that participates in the short-term rental business by collecting or receiving a fee for booking services through which a host may offer a transient lodging facility. Hosting platforms usually, though not necessarily, provide booking services through an online platform that allows a host to advertise the transient lodging through a website provided by the hosting platform and provides a means for the hosting platform to conduct a transaction by which prospective occupants arrange transient lodging and payment, whether occupant pays rent directly to the host or to the hosting platform.

“Local tax trustee” means the operator or hosting platform or designee thereof that accepts, receives or facilitates the payment directly from the occupant, whether or not the operator or hosting platform is the ultimate recipient of the payment.

“Occupancy” means the right to the use or possession of any space in transient lodging for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes for less than 30 days.

“Occupant” means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy in transient lodging for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days.

“Operator” means:

(a) Any person who provides transient lodging for occupancy to the general public for compensation. Furnishing accommodations can be done via employees, contractors, agents or any other person allowed to process reservations and accept payment for the transient lodging on behalf of the transient lodging provider; or

(b) Any person who facilitates the reservations of an accommodation and collects the payment for the transient lodging reservation from the occupant; or

(c) Any transient lodging provider, transient lodging intermediary or transient lodging tax collector as defined in ORS 320.300.

“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, corporation, limited liability partnership, association, host, social club, fraternal organization, fraternity, sorority, public or private dormitory, joint stock company, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

“Rent” means the consideration paid or payable by an occupant for the occupancy of space in transient lodging valued in money, goods, labor, credits, property, or other consideration. If a separate fee is charged for services, goods or commodities and the fee is optional, that fee is not included in rent.

“Short-term rental” means a house, duplex, multiplex, apartment, condominium, houseboat, trailer or other residential dwelling unit where a person rents guest bedrooms or the entire residential dwelling unit for transient lodging occupancy. Generally, a short-term rental is zoned residential or has a building occupancy that only allows for residential use.

“Tax Administrator” means the Accounting Manager of the City of Gladstone.

“Transient lodging” or “transient lodging facilities” means:

(a) Hotel, motel and inn dwelling units that are used for temporary overnight human occupancy;

(b) Spaces used for overnight parking of recreational vehicles or placement of tents during periods of human occupancy; or

(c) Houses, cabins, condominiums, apartment units or other dwelling units, or portions of any of these dwelling units that are used for temporary human occupancy.

History: Ord. 1479 §1, 2017.


5.70.020 Tax imposed.

(1) Effective January 1, 2018, each occupant shall pay a TLT in the amount of six percent of the rent. The occupant shall pay the TLT with the rent to the local tax trustee. TLT amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest cent. The local tax trustee shall maintain records of all rent charged and TLT payments received. If rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the TLT shall be paid by the occupant to the local tax trustee with each installment unless the occupant pays the entire amount with the first payment.

(2) Bills, receipts or invoices provided to occupants shall list the city TLT separately and must accurately state the amount of tax. All amounts listed as TLT on invoices, bills or receipts must be reported as TLT and, after collection, must be turned over to the city, less the five percent administrative charge.

History: Ord. 1479 §2, 2017.


5.70.030 Collection of tax by local tax trustee.

(1) Every local tax trustee shall collect the TLT at the time rent is paid, unless an exemption applies. If payment is by credit card, for purposes of this section, payment is made at the time credit card information is provided to local tax trustee, not when the local tax trustee ultimately receives credit for the transaction. While holding the payment in trust for the city, a local tax trustee may commingle the tax proceeds with the local tax trustee’s funds, but the local tax trustee is not the owner of tax proceeds; except that, when a return is filed, the local tax trustee becomes the owner of the administrative fee authorized to be retained. Local tax trustees may choose to file returns and remit payment based on amounts accrued but not yet collected. The local tax trustee is liable for any TLT that should have been collected from the occupant, except in cases of nonpayment of rent by the occupant.

(2) Upon request of the city, local tax trustees must provide all physical addresses of transient lodging facilities within the city limits and the related contact information, including the name and mailing address, of the general manager, agent, owner, host or other responsible person for the location.

Operators who own or operate transient lodging facilities in the City of Gladstone shall provide the address of the lodging facility. The registration form shall be signed by the operator. The Tax Administrator shall, within 15 days after registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to collect the TLT. The obligation to collect the TLT is imposed once rent for transient lodging is paid, even if the registration form has not been filed or if the certificate has not been issued. If rent transaction is facilitated online, the certificate of authority must be able to be viewed by the occupant by clicking on a link to the certificate of authority at a reasonable place during the payment transaction.

(2) Certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable, and shall be surrendered to the Tax Administrator when the business is sold or transferred or when a lodging facility ceases to operate at the location specified in the registration form. Each certificate issued to an operator for a specific lodging facility shall be prominently displayed at the lodging facility and include:

(a) The name of the operator;

(b) The address of the transient lodging facility;

(c) The date the certificate was issued; and

Any local tax trustee to whom an extension is granted shall pay interest at the rate of six percent per month on the amount of the remittance due without proration for a fraction of a month. If a return is not filed and the remittance and interest due is not paid by the end of the extension granted, then the interest shall become a part of the tax for computation of penalties.

In addition to the penalties imposed, interest shall be added to the overall tax amount due at the same rate established under ORS 305.220 for each month, or fraction of a month, from the time the return was originally required to be filed by the local tax trustee to the time of payment.

(i) Failure to move a vehicle or other personal property regulated by this section after expiration of any of the time periods set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this section constitutes prima facie evidence of violation of this section. For purposes of subsection (g) of this section, “move” is defined as transporting the vehicle or personal property a distance of one city block or 200 feet, whichever is less.

(c) Notice and Cure. The city shall give the ROW licensee written notice of any apparent violations before terminating a ROW license. The notice shall include a short and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance and provide a reasonable time (no less than 20 and no more than 40 days) for the licensee to demonstrate that the licensee has remained in compliance, that the licensee has cured or is in the process of curing any violation or noncompliance, or that it would be in the public interest to impose a penalty or sanction less than termination or revocation. If the licensee is in the process of curing a violation or noncompliance, the licensee must demonstrate that it acted promptly and continues to actively work on compliance. If the licensee does not respond or if the City Administrator or designee determines that the licensee’s response is inadequate, the City Administrator or designee shall refer the matter to the City Council, which shall provide a duly noticed public hearing to determine whether the license shall be terminated or revoked and if any penalties or sanctions will be imposed.

(d) Termination by Licensee. If a licensee ceases to use the ROW, as defined under this chapter, the licensee may terminate its license, with a 30-day notice to the city. Licensee may reapply for a ROW license at any time. No refunds or credits will be given for licenses terminated by the licensee or the city.

Any corresponding modification to the construction schedule may be subject to approval by the city.

12.24.090 Location of facilities.

(1) Location of Facilities. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city:

(a) Utility facilities shall be installed underground in all areas of the city where there are no existing poles in the ROW, there is no space on existing poles in the ROW, or where the only poles in the ROW are used only for high voltage lines (as defined below). This requirement shall not apply to facilities used for transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of 35,000 volts or to antennas, pedestals, cabinets or other above-ground equipment of any utility operator for which the utility operator has written authorization to place above-ground.

(b) Whenever any existing electric utilities, cable facilities or communications facilities are located underground within the ROW of the city, the utility operator with permission to occupy the same ROW shall install all new facilities underground at no cost to the city. This requirement shall not apply to facilities used for transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of 35,000 volts (“high voltage lines”) or to antennas, pedestals, cabinets or other above-ground equipment of any utility operator. The city reserves the right to require written approval of the location of any such above-ground equipment in the ROW.

(2) Interference with the Rights-of-Way. No utility operator or other person may locate or maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the rights-of-way by the city, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the rights-of-way. Utility facilities shall not be located in area of restricted sight distance nor interfere with the proper function of traffic control signs, signals, lighting, or other devices that affect traffic operation. All use of the rights-of-way shall be consistent with city codes, ordinances, rules and regulations in effect and as may be subsequently amended.

(3) Relocation of Utility Facilities.

(a) A utility operator shall, at no cost to the city, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facility within the ROW, including relocation of aerial facilities underground, when requested to do so in writing by the city.

(A) If relocation is required by the city, the city shall bear no responsibility or incur any costs, to provide or in any way secure alternate locations.

(b) Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the utility operator from requesting reimbursement or compensation from a third party, pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, tariffs or agreements; provided, that the utility operator shall timely comply with the requirements of this section regardless of whether or not it has requested or received such reimbursement or compensation.

(c) The city shall provide written notice of the time by which the utility operator must remove, relocate, change, alter or underground its facilities. If a utility operator fails to remove, relocate, alter or underground any utility facility as requested by the city and by the date reasonably established by the city, the utility operator shall pay all costs incurred by the city due to such failure, including but not limited to costs related to project delays, and the city may cause, using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations, the utility facility to be removed, relocated, altered or undergrounded at the utility operator’s sole expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within 30 days.

(d) The city shall coordinate the schedule for relocation of utility facilities and based on such effort shall provide written notice of the time by which the utility operator must remove, relocate, change, alter or underground its facilities. If a utility operator fails to remove, relocate, change, alter or underground any utility facility as requested by the city by the date reasonably established by the city, the utility operator shall pay all costs incurred by the city due to such failure, including but not limited to costs related to project delays, and the city may cause, using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations, the utility facility to be removed, relocated, altered, or undergrounded at the utility operator’s sole expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within 30 days.

(e) The city will cooperate with the utility operator in securing alternate locations within the ROW. The city shall bear no responsibility to obtain, compensate, or otherwise assist the utility operator in relocation of its facilities to a location not in the control of the city.

(4) Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city, within 30 days following written notice from the city or such other time agreed to in writing by the city, a utility operator and any other person that owns, controls, or maintains any abandoned or unauthorized utility facility within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove the facility and restore the rights-of-way as provided in GMC Section 12.24.080.

(b) A utility system or facility is unauthorized under any of the following circumstances:

(A) The utility facility, or any portion of the facility, is outside the scope of authority granted by the city under the license, franchise or other written agreement. This includes facilities that were never licensed or franchised and facilities that were once licensed or franchised but for which the license or franchise has expired or been terminated. This does not include any facility for which the city has provided written authorization for abandonment in place.

(B) The facility has been abandoned and the city has not provided written authorization for abandonment in place. A facility is abandoned if it is not in use and is not planned for further use. A facility will be presumed abandoned if it is not used for a period of 12 consecutive months. A utility operator may overcome this presumption by presenting plans for future use of the facility.

(C) The utility facility is improperly constructed or installed or is in a location not permitted by the construction permit, license, franchise or this chapter.

(D) The utility operator is in violation of a material provision of this chapter and fails to cure such violation within 30 days of the city sending written notice of such violation, unless the city extends such time period in writing.

(5) Removal by City.

(a) The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any utility facilities located within the rights-of-way, without notice, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to a public health or safety emergency. The city will use qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations to the extent reasonably practicable without impeding the city’s response to the emergency. The city will use best efforts to provide the utility operator with notice prior to cutting or moving facilities. If prior notice is not possible, the city will provide such notice as soon as reasonably practicable after resolution of the emergency.

(b) If the utility operator fails to remove any facility when required to do so under this chapter, the city may remove the facility using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations, and the utility operator shall be responsible for paying the full cost of the removal and any administrative costs incurred by the city in removing the facility and obtaining reimbursement. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within 30 days. The obligation to remove shall survive the termination of the license or franchise.

(c) The city shall not be liable to any utility operator for any damage to utility facilities, or for any incidental or consequential losses resulting directly or indirectly therefrom, by the city or its contractor in removing, relocating or altering the facilities pursuant to subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section or undergrounding its facilities as required by subsection (1) of this section, or resulting from the utility operator’s failure to remove, relocate, alter or underground its facilities as required by those subsections, unless such damage arises directly from the city’s negligence or willful misconduct.

(6) Engineering Record Drawings. The utility operator shall provide the city with two complete sets of record drawings in a form acceptable to the city showing the location of all its utility facilities in the ROW after initial construction if such plan changed during construction. The utility operator shall provide updated complete sets of as built plans upon request of the city, but not more than once per year.

(7) Utility operator, utility provider and ROW licensee shall provide, at no cost to the city, a comprehensive map showing the location of any facility in the city. Such map shall be provided in a format acceptable to the city, with accompanying data sufficient enough for the city to determine the exact location of facilities, currently in Shapefile or Geodatabase format. The city may not request such information more than once per year.

The utility operator shall, at its own expense, repair and maintain facilities from time to time as may be necessary to accomplish this purpose.

(2) If, after written notice from the city of the need for repair or maintenance as required in subsection (1) of this section, a utility operator fails to repair and maintain facilities as requested by the city and by the date reasonably established by the city, the city may perform such repair or maintenance using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations at the utility operator’s sole expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within 30 days.

History: Ord. 1465 §3 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1493 §1 (Exh. A), 2018.


12.24.120 Vacation.

If the city vacates any ROW, or portion thereof, that a utility operator uses, the utility operator shall, at its own expense, remove its facilities from the ROW unless the city reserves a public utility easement, which the city shall make a reasonable effort to do; provided, that there is no expense to the city, or the utility operator obtains an easement for its facilities. If the utility operator fails to remove its facilities within 30 days after a ROW is vacated, or as otherwise directed or agreed to in writing by the city, the city may remove the facilities using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations at the utility operator’s sole expense. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within 30 days.

(2) A utility operator whose only facilities in the ROW are facilities mounted on above-ground structures within the ROW, which structures are owned by another person, and with no facilities strung between such structures or otherwise within, under or above the ROW (other than equipment necessary to operate the mounted facilities that has been expressly approved by the city to be placed in the ROW), shall pay the attachment fee set by City Council resolution for each attachment, or such other fee set forth in the license granted by the city. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city, the fee shall be paid quarterly, in arrears, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter and shall be accompanied by information sufficient to illustrate the calculation of the amount payable.

(3) No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable.

(4) Right-of-way use fee payments required by this section shall be reduced by any franchise fee payments received by the city, but in no case will be less than $0.00.

(5) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city, the ROW use fee set forth in subsection (1) of this section shall be paid quarterly, in arrears, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

(1) It is the policy of the city to provide the planning, engineering and administration necessary to develop, manage, or contract for sewer facilities that are adequate for the transportation, treatment and disposal of wastes from within the city and to operate the sewer system in a manner which protects public health and the environment. In carrying out this policy, the objectives of this chapter are:

(a) To prevent pollutants from entering the sewer system which will interfere with its normal operation or contaminate the resulting sludge;

(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the sewerage system which will not be adequately treated and will pass through into the environment;

(c) To improve the opportunity for recycling and reclamation of wastewater and sludge.

(2) It is the intent of the city to provide needed sewer service to all users while meeting the outlined objectives. This chapter provides the structure under which the service will be provided for industrial waste so that the system is protected and can continue to provide efficiently for the waste treatment needs of the city.

13.14.100 Extra-strength industrial waste charges.

(1) Industrial waste is subject to the extra-strength sewage charge if it has a biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 milligrams per liter or a suspended solids concentration in excess of three hundred fifty milligrams per liter. The city may establish levels of other pollutants which are to be subject to extra strength charges, the amount of the charges to be determined by the City Administrator. Payment of the extra-strength sewage charge does not relieve the discharger of responsibility for all other applicable provisions of this chapter.

(2) Basis of Extra-Strength Sewage Charge Rates:

(a) Concentration. The concentration of each pollutant in excess of the limits specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be used to determine the extra-strength sewage charge rate (dollars per one hundred cubic feet) throughout the time interval between sample periods. The concentration shall be the average value of daily composite samples taken over a period of five days, except when another period is specified by the City Administrator. Samples shall be taken at an approval sampling manhole or other location adjudged by the City Administrator to be suitable so that samples will be representative. The rate of charge for each pollutant is established by City Council resolution;

(b) Volume. The volume used to bill the extra- strength sewage charge shall be the total metered water supply to the premises. However, there the industrial waste is discharged separately from domestic, product, or cooling waters, and the industrial user provides a meter or other acceptable method of determining the quantity of water not subject to the extra-strength sewage charge, then an appropriate allowance for such other uses shall be made. The allowance for domestic sewage shall be one thousand cubic square feet per nine employees, unless this allowance is included in another measurement.

(3) Other Charge Computations. If unusual effluent conditions make calculations by the composite method impossible or unrealistic, another method of sampling and computations acceptable to the City Administrator and based on the rates established by City Council resolution may be implemented.

(4) Billing. Extra-strength sewage charges shall be either included with the periodic water-sewer bills or shall be billed separately by the City Administrator. Extra-strength charges shall be enforceable and collectable in the same manner as water and sewer charges.

(5) Minimal Charges—Suspension. The City Council by resolution may establish a minimum limit or monthly extra-strength charges. The billing for all accounts whose monthly extra-strength charges are below this minimum limit, will be suspended until such time as they are found to be higher.

(6) Adjustments. The City Administrator may check sewage strength as outlined in this section and adjust charges where applicable at any time in accordance with the most recent analysis.

(7) Resampling Request—Fees. Any discharger may request the city to resample wastewater at no charge if eighteen months or more have elapsed since the last such sampling. If less than eighteen months have elapsed since the last sampling, then requests for the city to resample wastes shall be submitted in writing and accompanied by full payment for the resampling fee.

(8) Termination or Limitation. Notwithstanding prior acceptance into the city sewer system of industrial wastes under this section, if the City Administrator finds that industrial wastes from a particular commercial or industrial occupancy or a class of wastes from similar commercial or industrial occupancies cause or may cause damage to the city sewer system; or a nuisance or hazard to the city system; or a nuisance or hazard to the city sewer system, city personnel or the receiving waters; then the City Administrator may limit the characteristics or volume of the industrial wastes accepted under this section, or may terminate the acceptance. Notice of the limitation or termination shall be given in writing to the occupant of the property involved and shall specify the date when the limitation or termination is to be effective. It is unlawful for any person to discharge or permit the discharge of industrial wastes in violation of this notice. The provisions of this subsection are in addition to the provisions of GMC Section 13.14.110.

13.20.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method to reimburse a person who finances the construction of a public improvement that has the capacity to serve development other than the development for which the improvement is built. The person seeking to finance the improvement must be deemed to pay all or a disproportionately large part of the improvement. The charge or charges paid by a benefitted property should be reasonably related to the use the benefitted property makes of the public improvement. The process set forth in this chapter is jurisdictional, and cannot be waived or extended and the failure of a person to follow the provisions of this chapter shall result in the City Administrator rejecting the application.

Statutory Reference: ORS Ch. 280

History: Ord. 1051 §1, 1985; Ord. 1346, 2004.

(5) “LGIP” means local government investment pool.

(6) “Person” is a natural person, the person’s heirs, executors, administrators or assigns; a firm, partnership, corporation, association or legal entity, its successors or assigns; any agent, employee or any representative of the above or any other legal entity, including the City of Gladstone.

History: Ord. 1051 §1, 1985; Ord. 1093 §1, 1988; Ord. 1346, 2004.


13.20.030 Initiation and application.

(1) Any person may choose, or pursuant to a land use decision approval may be required, to construct a public improvement that costs in excess of the current threshold amount. If this person finances the improvement, in whole or disproportionately large part, and the improvement will or could provide service to development other than the development owned by that person or for which the improvement is built, that person may apply to the city to form a reimbursement district.

(2) An application or reapplication to establish a reimbursement district shall be in writing, shall be filed with the City Administrator, and shall be accompanied by a processing fee established by resolution of the City Council.

(3) The application or reapplication shall include the following:

(a) A description of the location, type and capacity of the public improvement proposed to be the basis for the reimbursement district;

(b) A narrative statement explaining why the person financing the public improvement believes all or part of the cost of the public improvement is eligible for reimbursement pursuant to this chapter. This statement shall clearly indicate that only the costs of improvements not benefitting the person’s property are subject to reimbursement;

(c) A map showing the area proposed to be included in the proposed reimbursement district and indicating the following information:

(A) The comprehensive plan designation, and zoning for each property in the proposed reimbursement district;

(B) The frontage length and square footage of each property within the proposed reimbursement district, or other similar data necessary for calculating the apportionment of the costs; and

(C) Identification of the properties owned by the person applying for the reimbursement district, or in the alternative, those properties benefitting from the improvement and being developed by the person.

(d) Legal descriptions of all or some of the properties within the proposed reimbursement district, if requested by the City Administrator.

(e) Mailing labels for notice to all parties entitled to receive mailed notice of the application. The person applying for the reimbursement district shall use the names and addresses of property owners within the notice area indicated on the most recent property tax roll. This may require the person applying for the reimbursement district to resubmit additional labels depending on the final report’s recommendations;

(f) A proposed methodology for calculating costs to future development in the reimbursement district. The City Administrator may be able to provide possible methodologies to the person applying for the reimbursement district, however, use of a methodology suggested by the City Administrator shall not guarantee approval of either the methodology or the reimbursement district;

(g) The estimated costs of the public improvement to be reimbursed as evidenced by bids, projections of the cost of labor and materials, or other evidence satisfactory to the City Administrator; and

(h) The date the public improvement is estimated to be complete.

(4) The City Council finds that it is in Gladstone’s best interest for a district to be established, if at all, prior to the construction of public improvements. Therefore, the initial application for formation of a reimbursement district shall be made before city approval of specific reimbursement district portions of construction plans and authorization to proceed with the construction of the portions of public improvements. The person applying for the reimbursement district may proceed at their own risk with the construction of the public improvements prior to City Council authorizing the reimbursement district. However, in such cases, if the City Council does not authorize the district, the person applying for the reimbursement district shall be responsible for the full cost of the public improvement.

(5) If the person applying for the reimbursement district desires to reapply after a district is not created, that person shall submit a new application and processing fee.

17.25.010 Purpose.

Chapter 17.25 is adopted to implement the policies of the Comprehensive Plan for Habitat Conservation Areas.


17.25.020 Area of application.

A. Chapter 17.25 applies in the Habitat Conservation Area District (HCAD). The HCAD applies to all parcels containing a Habitat Conservation Area (HCA). The HCAD also applies to any area that is less than 100 feet outside the boundary of an HCA even if the area is not located on the same parcel as the HCA. HCAs are identified on maps adopted by reference in Chapter 6 of the Comprehensive Plan (hereinafter referred to as the HCA Map) and are categorized as High, Moderate, or Low HCA.

B. An applicant may dispute the location of an HCA by submitting an application for HCA Map Verification pursuant to Section 17.25.060(B) or by applying for a Comprehensive Plan amendment to modify the HCA Map. HCA Map Verification does not amend the Comprehensive Plan.

C. Development within an HCA in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.25 shall not result in removal of such developed areas from the HCA and shall not change the applicable HCA category.


17.25.030 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined in this Subsection, words or phrases used in Chapter 17.25 shall be interpreted to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and to give Chapter 17.25 its most reasonable application.

A. Bankfull Stage: The stage or elevation at which water overflows the natural banks of streams or other waters of the state and begins to inundate the upland. The bankfull stage may be approximated using either the two-year recurrence interval flood elevation or one foot measured vertically above the ordinary mean high water line.

B. Building Footprint: The area that is covered by buildings or other roofed structures. A roofed structure includes any structure more than six feet above grade at any point, and that provides an impervious cover over what is below. Building footprint also includes uncovered horizontal structures such as decks, stairways, and entry bridges that are more than six feet above grade. Eaves are not included in the building footprint. Underground facilities and structures are defined based on the foundation line.

C. Developed Areas Not Providing Vegetative Cover: Areas that do not meet the definition of Forest Canopy, Low Structure Vegetation or Open Soils, or Woody Vegetation.

D. Developed Flood Area: A flood area (a) upon which a building or other structure has been located, or (b) that is an uncovered, hard-surfaced area or an area covered with a perforated hard surface (such as “Grasscrete”) that is able to withstand vehicular traffic or other heavy-impact uses; provided, however, that graveled areas shall not be considered developed flood areas.

E. Development: any manmade change defined as structures, roads, utilities, mining, dredging, paving, filling, or grading in amounts greater than 10 cubic yards. In addition, “development” is any other activity that results in the removal of more than 10 percent or 20,000 square feet of the Habitat Conservation Area vegetation on a lot of record, whichever is less. The calculation of the amount of vegetative cover removed shall be done separately for each lot of record and shall include all vegetative cover removed after December 8, 2009, regardless of whether the removal is done as one project or a series of projects. When individual trees are removed, the area contained within the tree’s drip line shall be the basis for calculating the square footage of vegetation removed.

F. Disturb: Manmade changes to the existing physical status of the land, which are made in connection with development.

G. Disturbance Area: An area that contains all temporary and permanent development, exterior improvements, and staging and storage areas on the site. For new development the disturbance area must be contiguous. The disturbance area does not include agricultural and pasture lands or naturalized areas.

H. Drip Line: The outermost edge of a tree’s canopy; when delineating the drip line on the ground, it will appear as an irregularly shaped circle defining the canopy’s perimeter.

I. Ecological Functions: The primary biological and hydrologic characteristics of healthy fish and wildlife habitat. Riparian ecological functions include microclimate and shade, streamflow moderation and water storage, bank stabilization and sediment/pollution control, sources of large woody debris and natural channel dynamics, and organic material sources. Upland wildlife ecological functions include size of habitat area, amount of habitat with interior conditions, connectivity of habitat to water resources, connectivity to other habitat areas, and presence of unique habitat types.

J. Emergency: Any manmade or natural event or circumstance causing or threatening loss of life, injury to person or property, and includes, but is not limited to, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, drought, earthquake, volcanic activity, spills or releases of oil or hazardous material, contamination, utility or transportation disruptions, and disease.

K. Enhancement: The process of improving upon the natural functions and/or values of an area or water resource that has been degraded by human activity. Enhancement activities may or may not return the site to a pre-disturbance condition, but create/recreate beneficial processes and resources that occur naturally.

L. Erosion: The movement of soil particles resulting from actions of water or wind.

M. Fill: Any material such as, but not limited to, sand, soil, rock, or gravel that is placed in a wetland or flood area for the purposes of development.

N. Flood Areas: Lands contained within the Floodplain Management District regulated by Section Chapter 17.25 and lands that were inundated in the February 1996 flood. (Note: Areas that were mapped as flood areas but were filled to a level above the base flood level prior to September 30, 2005, consistent with all applicable local, state, and federal laws shall no longer be considered habitat based on their status as flood areas.)

O. Flood Management Areas: Flood areas and, in addition, lands that have documented evidence of flooding.

P. Forest Canopy: Areas that are part of a contiguous grove of trees of one acre or larger in area with approximately 60% or greater crown closure, irrespective of whether the entire grove is within 200 feet of the relevant water resource.

Q. Habitat-Friendly Development: A method of developing property that has less detrimental impact on fish and wildlife habitat than do traditional development methods. Examples include clustering development to avoid habitat, using alternative materials and designs such as pier, post, or piling foundations designed to minimize tree root disturbance, managing storm water on-site to help filter rainwater and recharge groundwater sources, collecting rooftop water in rain barrels for reuse in site landscaping and gardening, and reducing the amount of effective impervious surface created by development.

R. Invasive Non-Native or Noxious Vegetation: Plant species that are listed in the Oregon Department of Agriculture’s Noxious Weed Policy and Classification System.

S. Low Structure Vegetation or Open Soils: Areas that are part of a contiguous area one acre or larger of grass, meadow, crop-lands, or areas of open soils located within 300 feet of a surface stream (low structure vegetation areas may include areas of shrub vegetation less than one acre in size if they are contiguous with areas of grass, meadow, crop-lands, orchards, Christmas tree farms, holly farms, or areas of open soils located within 300 feet of a surface stream and together form an area of one acre in size or larger).

T. Mitigation: The reduction of adverse effects of proposed development by considering, in the following order

1. Avoiding the impact by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

2.  Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation;

3.  Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

4.  Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action by monitoring and taking appropriate measures; and

5.  Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing comparable substitute Habitat Conservation Areas.

U. Native Vegetation: Vegetation native to the Portland metropolitan area provided that it is not invasive non-native or noxious vegetation.

V. Open Space: Land that is undeveloped and that is planned to remain so indefinitely. The term encompasses parks, forests, and farmland. It may also refer only to land zoned as being available to the public, including playgrounds, watershed preserves, and parks.

W. Ordinary Mean High Water Line: The line on the bank or shore to which water ordinarily rises in season.

X. Practicable: Available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purpose and probable impact on ecological functions. The practicability of a development option shall include consideration of the type of HCA that will be affected by the proposed development. For example, High HCAs have been so designated because they are areas that have been identified as having lower urban development value and higher-valued habitat, so it should be more difficult to show that alternative development options that avoid the habitat are not practicable. On the other hand, Low HCAs have been so designated because they are areas that have been identified as having higher urban development value and lower-valued habitat, so it should be less difficult to show that alternative development options that avoid the habitat are not practicable.

Y. Restoration: The process of returning a disturbed or altered area or water resource to a previously existing natural condition. Restoration activities reestablish the structure, function, or diversity to that which existed prior to impacts caused by human activity.

Z. Riparian: Those areas associated with streams, lakes, and wetlands where vegetation communities are predominately influenced by their association with water.

AA. Significant Detrimental Impact: An impact that affects the natural environment, considered individually or cumulatively with other impacts on the HCA, to the point where existing fish and wildlife habitat functional values are degraded.

BB. Stormwater: The surface water runoff that results from all natural forms of precipitation.

CC. Stormwater Pretreatment Facility: Any structure or drainage way that is designed, constructed, and maintained to collect and filter, retain, or detain surface water run-off during and after a storm event for the purpose of water quality improvement.

DD. Stream: A body of running water moving over the earth’s surface in a channel or bed, such as a creek, rivulet, or river. A stream flows at least part of the year, including perennial and intermittent streams. Streams are dynamic in nature and their structure is maintained through build-up and loss of sediment.

EE. Structure: A building or other major improvement that is built, constructed, or installed, not including minor improvements—such as fences, utility poles, flagpoles, or irrigation system components—that are not customarily regulated through zoning codes.

FF. Urban Development Value: The economic value of a property lot or parcel as determined by analyzing three separate variables: assessed land value, value as a property that could generate jobs (“employment value”), and the Metro 2040 design type designation of property. The urban development value of all properties containing regionally significant fish and wildlife habitat is depicted on the Metro Habitat Urban Development Value Map.

GG. Utility Facilities: Buildings, structures, or any constructed portion of a system that provides for the production, transmission, conveyance, delivery, or furnishing of services including, but not limited to, heat, light, water, power, natural gas, sanitary sewer, stormwater, telephone, and cable television. Utility facilities do not include stormwater pre-treatment facilities.

HH. Water Resource: All rivers, streams (regardless of whether they carry year-round flow, i.e., including intermittent streams), springs which feed streams and wetlands and have year-round flow, flood management areas, wetlands, and all other bodies of open water.

II. Watershed: A watershed is a geographic unit defined by the flows of rainwater or snowmelt. All land in a watershed drains to a common outlet, such as a stream, lake, or wetland.

JJ. Wetlands: Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands are those areas identified and delineated by a qualified wetland specialist as set forth in the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual.

KK. Woody Vegetation: Areas that are part of a contiguous area one acre or larger of shrub or open or scattered forest canopy (less than 60% crown closure) located within 300 feet of a surface stream.

1. Development in an HCA or for a parcel that:

a. Contains an HCA; and

b. Is the subject of a land use application for a partition or subdivision.

2. If a parcel is subject to Subsections 17.25.060(C)(1)(a) and (b), an application for an HCA Development Permit shall be filed concurrently with the application for a partition or subdivision.

3. An application for an HCA Development Permit shall be reviewed pursuant to Section 17.94.050 unless the application is filed concurrently with another land use application that requires review by the Planning Commission or City Council, in which case the applications will be consolidated and reviewed pursuant to Section 17.94.040.

D. HCA Map Verification and HCA Development Permits shall be valid for five years from the date of the final written decision, except:

1. If development lawfully commences within the five-year time period, HCA Map Verification and HCA Development Permits shall remain valid until the development is complete or has been abandoned. Development will be considered to be abandoned if building or grading permits authorizing the development have lapsed or work not requiring a building or grading permit has been discontinued for more than one year; and

2. HCA Map Verification that was valid on the date when the final plat for a subdivision or partition was recorded with the County Clerk shall remain valid for subsequent development on the lots or parcels created by the subdivision or partition.

17.25.080 Construction management plans.

A Construction Management Plan (CMP) shall comply with the following criteria.

A. Erosion prevention and sediment control (EPSC) measures shall be required and shall comply with the standards of the EPSC regulatory authority.

B. Orange construction fencing (i.e. safety fencing, snow fencing, or a comparable product) shall be installed on or outside the boundary of the HCA, except where the drip line of a protected tree extends outside the HCA, in which case the drip line shall be included inside the fencing. This requirement may be modified or waived if:

1. Disturbance of the HCA is authorized pursuant to Section 17.25.040 or 17.25.100, in which case the fencing shall be installed in such a manner as to protect the area of the HCA not authorized for disturbance; or

2. The HCA is already lawfully developed, in which case the fencing shall be installed in such a manner as to protect any water resource that is the basis for the HCA designation and any area of the HCA where naturalized vegetative cover exists.

C. Trees in the HCA shall not be used as anchors for stabilizing construction equipment.

D. Native soils disturbed during development shall be conserved on the subject property.

E. Development shall not commence until the EPSC measures and fencing required pursuant to Subsections 17.25.080(A) and (B) are in place.

F. Compliance with the CMP shall be maintained until the development is complete.


17.25.090 HCA map verification.

HCA Map Verification shall be subject to the following criteria.

A. An applicant for HCA Map Verification shall use one or more of the following methods to verify the Habitat Conservation Area (HCA) boundary and, if applicable, the boundary between High, Moderate, and Low HCA.

1. The applicant may concur with the accuracy of the HCA Map of the subject property;

2. The applicant may demonstrate that a computer mapping error was made in the creation of the HCA map (e.g., the mapped vegetative cover layer—which was derived from aerial photographs taken in the summer of 2002 and was used to establish the Vegetative Cover Map and the HCA Map—in Metro’s geographic information system database does not align precisely with the tax lot layer, thereby resulting in an HCA Map of the subject property that is also misaligned with tax lot lines);

3. The applicant may demonstrate that the subject property was developed lawfully between August 1, 2002 (when the taking of the aerial photographs used to determine the regional habitat inventory commenced) and December 8, 2009 and, therefore, that the HCA boundary or category (High, Moderate, or Low) is inaccurate; or

4. If the identified HCA is riparian habitat rather than publicly-owned upland habitat, the applicant may demonstrate that the HCA Map is inaccurate for a reason other than those described in Subsections 17.25.090(A)(2) and (3).

B. The Planning Administrator, or if the application is reviewed pursuant to the Planning Commission provisions of Chapter 17.94 the Planning Commission, shall determine the location of any HCA on the subject property by considering information submitted by the applicant, information collected during any site visit that may be made to the subject property, information generated by prior HCA Map Verification that has occurred on adjacent properties, and any other relevant information that has been provided.

C. For applications filed pursuant to Subsection 17.25.090(A)(1) or (2), the HCA Map shall be deemed to be accurate unless, as described in Subsection 17.25.090(A)(2), there was a computer mapping error (e.g., an alignment error) made in the creation of the HCA map.

D. For applications filed pursuant to Subsection 17.25.090(A)(3), developed areas not providing vegetative cover shall be removed from the HCA, provided that they were developed lawfully between August 1, 2002, and December 8, 2009, and are more than 50 feet from the water resource. Developed areas not providing vegetative cover that were developed lawfully between August 1, 2002, and December 8, 2009, and are 50 feet or less from the water resource, shall remain classified as HCA, but the HCA category shall be changed if necessary to remain consistent with Tables 1 and 2.

E. For applications filed pursuant to Subsection 17.25.090(A)(4), the HCA boundary shall be established as follows:

1. Locate the water resource that was inventoried by Metro and is the basis for the HCA designation, including: Bankfull stage of streams, rivers, and bodies of open water on or within 200 feet of the subject property; flood areas on or within 100 feet of the subject property; and wetlands on or within 150 feet of the subject property based on the 1994 Clackamas County Wetland Inventory maps adopted by reference in the Comprehensive Plan and the Metro 2002 Wetland Inventory Map (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 N.E. Grand Ave., Portland, OR 97232; 503-797-1742). Identified wetlands shall be further delineated consistent with methods currently accepted by the Oregon Division of State Lands and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

2. Identify the vegetative cover status of all areas on the subject property that are within 200 feet of the bankfull stage of streams, rivers, and bodies of open water; are wetlands or are within 150 feet of wetlands; and are flood areas or are within 100 feet of flood areas.

a. Vegetative cover status shall be as identified on the Metro Vegetative Cover Map (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 N.E. Grand Ave., Portland, OR 97232; 503-797-1742); or

b. Vegetative cover status may be adjusted if the property was developed lawfully between August 1, 2002, and December 8, 2009, or an error was made at the time the vegetative cover status was determined by Metro. To assert the latter type of error, applicants shall submit an analysis of the vegetative cover on their property using summer 2002 aerial photographs and the definitions of the different vegetative cover types provided in Section 17.25.030.

3. Determine whether the degree that the land slopes upward from all streams, rivers, and bodies of open water on or within 200 feet of the subject property is greater than or less than 25 percent. A minimum of three slope measurements along the water resource shall be made on the subject property. The measurements shall be made at no more than 100-foot increments, which means that more than three measurements may be required, depending on the length of the water resource on the subject property. Slope shall be measured in 25-foot increments away from the water resource until a point 200 feet from the starting point of measurement is reached. Where the protected water resource is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of ravine is the break in the greater-than-25-percent slope; and

4. Using Table 1 and the data identified pursuant to Subsections 17.25.090(E)(1) through (3), identify all Class I and II riparian areas on the subject property. The riparian class may vary within a single property.

Table 1 

Method for Locating Boundaries of Class I and II Riparian Areas 

	Distance from Water Resource	Vegetative Cover Status1

	Developed areas not providing vegetative cover	Low structure vegetation or open soils 	Woody vegetation	Forest canopy

	Streams

	0-50’ 	Class II 	Class I2 	Class I 	Class I

	50’-100’ 	 	Class II3	Class I 	Class I

	100’-150’ 	 	Class II3 if slope>25% 	Class II3 if slope>25% 	Class II3

	150’-200’ 	 	Class II3 if slope>25% 	Class II3 if slope>25% 	Class II3 if slope>25%

	Wetlands (Wetland itself is a Class I Riparian Area)

	0-100’ 	 	Class II3	Class I 	Class I

	100’-150’ 	 	 	 	Class II3

	Flood Areas

	Within 300’ of river or surface stream	 	Class I	Class I	Class I

	More than 300’ from river or surface stream	See footnote 4.	Class II3	Class II3	Class I

	0-100’ from edge of flood area	 	 	Class II3,5	Class II3

	1 The vegetative cover type assigned to any particular area is based on two factors: the type of vegetation and the size of the overall contiguous area of vegetative cover to which a particular piece of vegetation belongs. For example, in order to qualify as “forest canopy,” the forested area has to be part of a larger patch of forest of at least one acre in size.

2 These areas shall be Class II riparian areas if the stream is a high gradient stream. High gradient streams are identified on the Metro Vegetative Cover Map. If the applicant believes the gradient of a stream was incorrectly identified, then the applicant may demonstrate the correct classification by identifying the channel type using the methodology described in the Oregon Watershed Assessment Manual, published by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, and appended to the Metro’s Riparian Corridor and Wildlife Habitat Inventories Report, Attachment 1 to Exhibit F to Metro Ordinance No. 05-1077C.

3 Areas that have been identified as habitats of concern, as designated on the Metro Habitats of Concern Map (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 N.E. Grand Ave., Portland, OR 97232; 503-797-1742), shall be Class I riparian areas, unless additional information is provided that establishes that they do not meet the criteria used to identify habitats of concern as described in Metro’s Technical Report for Fish and Wildlife. Examples of habitats of concern include: Oregon white oak woodlands, bottomland hardwood forests, wetlands, native grasslands, riverine islands or deltas, and important wildlife migration corridors.

4 If development prior to December 8, 2009, within a contiguous, undeveloped flood area (to include contiguous flood areas on adjacent properties) that was not mapped as having any vegetative cover has reduced the size of that contiguous flood area to less than one half of an acre in size, then the remaining flood area shall also be considered a developed flood area and shall not be identified as habitat.

5 Only if within 300 feet of a river or surface stream.

5. Use the Metro Habitat Urban Development Value Map (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 N.E. Grand Ave., Portland, OR 97232; 503-797-1742) to identify the urban development value of the subject property.

a. An upward adjustment of the subject property’s urban development value designation shall be made if the Metro 2040 Design Type designation for the subject property has changed from a category designated as a lower urban development value category to one designated as a higher urban development value category. 2040 Design Type designations are identified on the Metro 2040 Applied Concept Map (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 N.E. Grand Ave., Portland, OR 97232; 503-797-1742). The urban development value categories of the 2040 Design Types are identified in the footnotes to Table 2.

b. If the subject property is owned by a regionally significant educational or medical facility, as designated by Title 13 of the Metro Urban Growth Management Functional Plan, it is designated as of high urban development value.

c. If the subject property is located outside the Portland Metropolitan Urban Growth Boundary and therefore does not have a Metro 2040 Design Type designation, it is designated as of high urban development value.

6. Use Table 2 to cross-reference habitat class with urban development value in order to categorize identified HCA as High, Moderate, or Low HCA.

Table 2 

Method for Identifying Habitat Conservation Areas (HCA) 

	Fish & wildlife habitat classification 	High urban development value1	Medium urban development value2	Low urban development value3	Publicly owned parks and open spaces

	Class I Riparian 	Moderate HCA 	High HCA 	High HCA 	High HCA4

	Class II Riparian 	Low HCA 	Low HCA 	Moderate HCA 	Moderate HCA4

	Class A Upland Wildlife 	No HCA 	No HCA 	No HCA 	High HCA 4

	Class B Upland Wildlife 	No HCA 	No HCA 	No HCA 	High HCA 4

	NOTE: The default urban development value of property is as depicted on the Metro Habitat Urban Development Value Map. The Metro 2040 Design Type designations provided in the following footnotes are only for use when making an adjustment pursuant to Subsection 706.09(E)(5)(a).

1 Primary 2040 design type: Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, and Regionally Significant Industrial Areas

2 Secondary 2040 design type: Main Streets, Station Communities, Other Industrial Areas, and Employment Centers

3 Tertiary 2040 design type: Inner and Outer Neighborhoods and Corridors

4 HCAs in publicly owned parks and open spaces designated as natural areas shall be considered High HCA+. HCAs in other publicly owned parks and open spaces shall be designated as shown in Table 2.


17.25.100 Habitat conservation area development permits.

A Habitat Conservation Area (HCA) Development Permit shall be approved if the applicant provides evidence substantiating compliance with either Subsection 17.25.100(A) or (B). However, if the proposed development is in a Water Quality Resource Area District regulated pursuant to Chapter 17.27, it shall comply with either Subsection 17.25.100(B) or 17.25.100, except that if the subject parcel contains an HCA and a WQRA and is the subject of a land use application for a partition or subdivision, the partition or subdivision shall comply with the requirements of Sections 17.25.100 and 17.25.110, and if the provisions conflict, the most restrictive standard shall apply.

A. Development in an HCA shall be permitted subject to the following criteria:

1. Except as provided in Subsections 17.25.100(A)(2) through (5), a maximum disturbance area (MDA) shall apply to the subject property.

a. The MDA shall be calculated pursuant to Table 3 for property with a Comprehensive Plan designation of Urban Low Density Residential and Table 4 for property with any other Comprehensive Plan designation.

Table 3 

Maximum Disturbance Area for Urban Low Density Residential Property 

	HCA Type 1	Maximum Disturbance Area

	High	50 percent of the area of the subject property, up to a maximum of 5,000 square feet

	Moderate/Low2	65 percent of the area of the subject property, up to a maximum of 6,000 square feet

	1 If more than one HCA Type is present on the subject property, the MDA shall be based on the predominant type. For the purpose of this provision, High HCA shall be the predominant type if at least 50 percent of the area of the HCA on the subject property is High HCA.

2 For the purpose of Table 3, Moderate and Low HCA shall be combined as one HCA Type.

Table 4 

Maximum Disturbance Area for Other Property Inside the City 

	HCA Type	Maximum Disturbance Area1

	High 	10 percent of High HCA on the subject property

	Moderate 	15 percent of Moderate HCA on the subject property

	Low 	50 percent of Low HCA on the subject property

	1 The MDA refers only to the maximum percentage of each type of HCA that may be disturbed. Table 4 imposes no limit on disturbance area outside an HCA.

2. The following disturbance area limitations shall apply to certain utility facilities. Utility facilities other than those addressed in Subsections 17.25.100(A)(2)(a) through (c) shall be subject to Subsection 17.25.100(A)(1).

a. The disturbance area for private connections of utility lines, pipes, or cables to other utility facilities shall be no greater than 10 feet wide.

b. The disturbance area for the upgrade of existing utility lines, pipes, or cables shall be no greater than 15 feet wide.

c. The disturbance area for new underground utility lines, pipes, or cables shall be no greater than 25 feet wide and shall disturb no more than 200 linear feet of the Water Quality Resource Area District regulated pursuant to Chapter 17.27, provided that this disturbance area, with the exception of necessary access points to the utility facility, shall be restored by the planting of native vegetation.

3. A partition of a parcel that contains an HCA shall comply with one of the following options:

a. There shall be no more than a 30 percentage point difference in the percentage of each parcel’s area that is in an HCA. For example, a partition that produces two parcels, one that is 55 percent HCA and the other that is 35 percent HCA, is permissible; whereas a partition that produces two parcels, one that is 75 percent HCA and the other that is 30 percent HCA, is not permissible. In this case, development in the HCA shall be subject to further review under Chapter 17.25;

b. The partition shall comply with Subsection 17.25.100(A)(4); or

c. The applicant shall demonstrate, through an analysis of different possible partition plans based on the characteristics and zoning of the subject property, that it is not practicable to comply with Subsection 17.25.100(A)(3)(a) or (b) and that the applicant’s alternate plan will result in the smallest practicable percentage point difference in the percentage of each parcel’s area that is in an HCA.

4. A subdivision of property that contains an HCA shall require that a minimum of 90 percent of the subject property’s High HCA and a minimum of 80 percent of its Moderate HCA shall be platted as a tract rather than as part of any lot. Any HCA that remains outside such a tract may be developed, subject to compliance with the mitigation standards of Subsection 17.25.100(A) or (B). Unless any HCA that remains outside an HCA tract is protected from development by a restrictive covenant or a conservation easement, it shall be assumed that such areas eventually will be developed, and mitigation shall be required. Mitigation shall be completed, or a performance bond in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of mitigation shall be posted with the County, prior to approval of the final plat.

a. If over 50% of the HCA on the subject property is High HCA, the entire calculation is for High (i.e., 90% of the HCA shall be placed within a separate tract).

b. If over 50% of the HCA on a property is Moderate HCA, the entire calculation is for Moderate (i.e., 80% of the HCA shall be placed within a separate tract).

c. An HCA tract shall be protected from development by restrictive covenant, conservation easement, or public dedication. However, the tract may be subject to an easement conveying storm and surface water management rights to the surface water management authority. The tract shall be designated as one of the following prior to final plat approval:

i. A private natural area owned by a homeowners association or a private non-profit with the mission of land conservation; or

ii. A public natural area where the tract has been dedicated to a public entity.

5. The MDA for publicly owned parks and open spaces designated as natural areas shall be five percent of the HCA on the subject property. Subsection 17.25.100(A)(5) imposes no limit on disturbance area outside an HCA for such natural areas.

6. If development in an HCA is approved pursuant to Subsection 17.25.100(A), compliance with the following mitigation standards shall be required, except that the mitigation standards for development in a wetland (as distinct from an HCA that is adjacent to a wetland) shall be only those required by federal and state law.

a. Required Plants and Plant Densities. All trees, shrubs and ground cover shall be native vegetation. An applicant shall comply with Subsection 17.25.100(A)(6)(a)(i) or (ii), whichever results in more tree plantings, except that where the disturbance area is one acre or more, the applicant shall comply with Subsection 17.25.100(A)(6)(a)(ii).

i. The mitigation requirement shall be calculated based on the number and size of trees that are removed from the site. Trees that are removed from the site shall be replaced as shown in Table 6. Conifers shall be replaced with conifers. Bare ground shall be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs. Non-native sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded, in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs; or

Table 6 

Tree Replacement 

	Size of Tree to be Removed (inches in diameter at breast height) 	Number of Trees and Shrubs to be Planted

	6 to 12 	2 trees and 3 shrubs

	over 12 to 18 	3 trees and 6 shrubs

	over 18 to 24 	5 trees and 12 shrubs

	over 24 to 30 	7 trees and 18 shrubs

	over 30 	10 trees and 30 shrubs

ii. The mitigation requirement shall be calculated based on the size of the disturbance area within the HCA. Native trees and shrubs shall be planted at a rate of five trees and 25 shrubs per every 500 square feet of disturbance area (calculated by dividing the number of square feet of disturbance area by 500, and then multiplying that result times five trees and 25 shrubs, and rounding all fractions to the nearest whole number of trees and shrubs; for example, if there will be 330 square feet of disturbance area, then 330 divided by 500 equals 0.66, and 0.66 times five equals 3.3, so three trees shall be planted, and 0.66 times 25 equals 16.5, so 17 shrubs shall be planted). Bare ground shall be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs. Non-native sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded, in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs.

b. Plant Size. Replacement trees shall be at least one-half inch in caliper, measured at six inches above the ground level for field grown trees or above the soil line for container grown trees (the one-half inch minimum size may be an average caliper measure, recognizing that trees are not uniformly round), unless they are oak or madrone which may be one-gallon size. Shrubs shall be in at least a one-gallon container or the equivalent in ball and burlap and shall be at least 12 inches in height.

c. Plant Spacing. Trees shall be planted between eight and 12 feet on center, and shrubs shall be planted between four and five feet on center, or clustered in single species groups of no more than four plants, with each cluster planted between eight and 10 feet on center. When planting near existing trees, the drip line of the existing tree shall be the starting point for plant spacing measurements.

d. Plant Diversity. Shrubs shall consist of at least two different species. If 10 trees or more are planted, then no more than 50 percent of the trees may be of the same genus.

e. Invasive Vegetation. Invasive non-native or noxious vegetation shall be removed within the mitigation area prior to planting, and shall be removed or controlled for five years following the date that the mitigation planting is completed.

f. Mulching. Mulch shall be applied around new plantings at a minimum of three inches in depth and 18 inches in diameter.

g. Tree and Shrub Survival. Trees and shrubs that die shall be replaced in kind to the extent necessary to ensure that a minimum of 80 percent of the trees initially required and 80 percent of the shrubs initially required shall remain alive on the fifth anniversary of the date that the mitigation planting is completed.

h. Monitoring and Reporting. Monitoring of the mitigation site shall be the ongoing responsibility of the property owner. For a period of five years following the date that the mitigation planting is completed, the property owner shall submit an annual report to the Planning Director documenting the survival of the trees and shrubs on the mitigation site. In lieu of complying with the monitoring and reporting requirement, the property owner may post with the County a performance bond, or other surety acceptable to the County, in an amount sufficient to cover costs of plant material and labor associated with site preparation, planting, and maintenance. An applicant who elects to post a surety shall be subject to Chapter 17.96.

7. The mitigation area required by Subsection 17.25.100(A)(6) shall be located as follows:

a. All vegetation shall be planted on the subject property, either within the HCA or in an area contiguous to the HCA, provided, however, that if the vegetation is planted in an area contiguous to the HCA, such area shall be protected from development by a restrictive covenant, conservation easement, or public dedication.

b. Off-site mitigation within the same subwatershed (6th Field Hydrologic Unit Code) as the HCA within which development is proposed, may be approved for part or all of the required mitigation, if the applicant provides evidence substantiating that:

i. It is not practicable to complete the mitigation on-site; and

ii. The applicant possesses legal authority to conduct and maintain the mitigation, such as having a sufficient ownership interest in the mitigation site, and, if the mitigation is not within an HCA, that the mitigation site will be protected from development after the monitoring period expires by a restrictive covenant, conservation easement, or public dedication.

8. An applicant may request to proportionally vary the number and size of trees and shrubs required pursuant to Subsections 17.25.100(A)(6)(a) and (b)—for example, to plant fewer larger trees and shrubs or to plant more smaller trees and shrubs—and a corresponding modification of the plant spacing requirements of Subsection 17.25.100(A)(6)(c). The request shall be approved if the applicant provides evidence substantiating that the proposed planting will achieve, at the end of the fifth year after initial planting, comparable or better mitigation results as the results that would be achieved if the applicant complied with all of the requirements of Subsections 17.25.100(A)(6)(a) through (c).

B. Development in an HCA that does not comply with Subsection 17.25.100(A) shall be permitted subject to the following criteria:

1. Development in the HCA shall be avoided to the extent practicable. If there is more than one category (High, Moderate, or Low) of HCA on the subject property, then the applicant shall first avoid the intrusion of development into the higher-valued HCA, to the extent practicable. To comply with these requirements, the following approaches shall be used, to the extent practicable:

a. Multi-story construction;

b. Minimizing building and development footprint;

c. Maximizing the use of native landscaping materials and meeting applicable landscaping requirements by preservation of the HCA as permitted by Chapter 17.46;

d. Minimal excavation foundation systems (e.g., pier, post, or piling foundation);

e. Placing facilities that are required to infiltrate stormwater onsite, including associated piping, within the HCA, provided that such facilities comply with Subsection 17.25.040(R); and

f. Complying with the setback standards of Section 17.25.110 rather than those of the underlying zoning district.

2. If there is no practicable alternative that will avoid disturbance of the HCA, then significant detrimental impacts to the HCA shall be minimized as follows:

a. The proposed development shall minimize loss of habitat as compared to other practicable alternatives, including significantly different practicable alternatives that would result in less development within the HCA.

b. The proposed development shall minimize significant detrimental impacts to ecological functions of the HCA on the subject property as compared to other practicable alternatives, including significantly different practicable alternatives that would result in less development within the HCA. The ecological functions that shall be considered are:

i. Connectivity of the habitat to water;

ii. Connectivity of the habitat to other habitat areas; and

iii. The functions identified in Table 7.

Table 7 

Ecological Functional Values of Riparian Corridors 

	Ecological function 	Landscape features providing functional values

	Microclimate and shade	Forest canopy or woody vegetation within 100 feet of a stream; a wetland1; or a flood area2

	Streamflow moderation and water storage 	A wetland or other water body3 with a hydrologic connection to a stream; or a flood area2

	Bank stabilization, sediment and pollution control 	All sites within 50 feet of a surface stream;

Forest canopy, woody vegetation, or low structure vegetation/open soils within 100 feet of a stream or a wetland; or forest canopy, woody vegetation, or low structure vegetation/open soils within a flood area; and

Forest canopy, woody vegetation, or low structure vegetation/open soils within 100-200 feet of a stream if the slope is greater than 25 percent

	Large wood and channel dynamics 	Forest canopy within 150 feet of a stream or wetland, or within a flood area; and

The channel migration zone is defined by the flood area, but where there is no mapped flood area, a default of 50 feet is established to allow for the channel migration zone.

	Organic material sources 	Forest canopy or woody vegetation within 100 feet of a stream or wetland, or within a flood area

	1 Refers to “hydrologically-connected wetlands,” which are located partially or wholly within ¼ mile of a surface stream or flood area.

2 Developed flood areas are not identified as HCAs because they do not provide primary ecological functional value.

3 “Other water body” could include lakes, ponds, reservoirs, or manmade water resource that is not a water quality facility or farm pond.

c. If there is more than one category of HCA on the subject property, then development within a higher-valued HCA shall be considered more detrimental than development within a lower-valued HCA.

d. To the extent practicable, development in the HCA shall be designed, located, and constructed to:

i. Minimize grading, removal of native vegetation, and disturbance and removal of native soils by using the approaches required by Section 17.25.080, reducing building footprints, and using minimal excavation foundation systems (e.g., pier, post, or piling foundation);

ii. Minimize adverse hydrological impacts on water resources, such as by using the techniques described in Part (a) of Table 8, unless their use is prohibited by an applicable and required state or federal permit issued to a unit of local government having jurisdiction in the area, such as a permit required under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§1251 et seq., or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§300f et seq., and including conditions or plans required by such permit;

iii. Minimize impacts on wildlife corridors and fish passage, such as by using the techniques described in Part (b) of Table 8; and

iv. Consider using the techniques described in Part (c) of Table 8. 

 

Table 8 

Habitat-Friendly Development Practices1

	Part (a): Design and Construction Practices to Minimize Hydrologic Impacts

	1. Amend disturbed soils to original or higher level of porosity to regain infiltration and stormwater storage capacity.

2. Use pervious paving materials for residential driveways, parking lots, walkways, and within centers of cul-de-sacs.

3. Incorporate stormwater management in road right-of-ways.

4. Landscape with rain gardens to provide on-lot detention, filtering of rainwater, and groundwater recharge.

5. Use green roofs for runoff reduction, energy savings, improved air quality, and enhanced aesthetics.

6. Disconnect downspouts from roofs and direct the flow to vegetated infiltration/filtration areas such as rain gardens.

7. Retain rooftop runoff in a rain barrel for later on-lot use in lawn and garden watering.

8. Use multi-functional open drainage systems in lieu of more conventional curb-and-gutter systems.

9. Use bioretention cells as rain gardens in landscaped parking lot islands to reduce runoff volume and filter pollutants.

10. Apply a treatment train approach to provide multiple opportunities for storm water treatment and reduce the possibility of system failure.

11. Reduce sidewalk width and grade them such that they drain to the front yard of a residential lot or retention area.

12. Reduce impervious impacts of residential driveways by narrowing widths and moving access to the rear of the site.

13. Use shared driveways.

14. Reduce width of residential streets, depending on traffic and parking needs.

15. Reduce street length, primarily in residential areas, by encouraging clustering and using curvilinear designs.

16. Reduce cul-de-sac radii and use pervious vegetated islands in center to minimize impervious effects, and allow them to be utilized for truck maneuvering/loading to reduce need for wide loading areas on site.

17. Eliminate redundant non-ADA sidewalks within a site (i.e., sidewalk to all entryways and/or to truck loading areas may be unnecessary for industrial developments).

18. Minimize car spaces and stall dimensions, reduce parking ratios, and use shared parking facilities and structured parking.

19. Minimize the number of stream crossings and place crossing perpendicular to stream channel if possible.

20. Allow narrow street right-of-ways through stream corridors whenever possible to reduce adverse impacts of transportation corridors.

	Part (b): Design and Construction Practices to Minimize Impacts on Wildlife Corridors and Fish Passage

	1. Carefully integrate fencing into the landscape to guide animals toward animal crossings under, over, or around transportation corridors.

2. Use bridge crossings rather than culverts wherever possible.

3. If culverts are utilized, install slab, arch or box type culverts, preferably using bottomless designs that more closely mimic stream bottom habitat.

4. Design stream crossings for fish passage with shelves and other design features to facilitate terrestrial wildlife passage.

5. Extend vegetative cover through the wildlife crossing in the migratory route, along with sheltering areas.

	Part (c): Miscellaneous Other Habitat-Friendly Design and Construction Practices

	1. Use native vegetation throughout the development (not just in HCA).

2. Locate landscaping (required by other sections of this Ordinance) adjacent to HCA.

3. Reduce light spill-off into HCAs from development.

4. Preserve and maintain existing trees and tree canopy coverage, and plant trees, where appropriate, to maximize future tree canopy coverage.

	1 These development practices represent the state of scientific knowledge at the time of the adoption of Chapter 17.25. If more effective habitat-friendly practices become available, they may be used.

3. If development in an HCA is approved pursuant to Subsection 17.25.100(B), compliance with the following mitigation standards shall be required, except that the mitigation standards for development in a wetland (as distinct from an HCA that is adjacent to a wetland) shall be only those required by federal and state law.

a. Compliance with Subsections 17.25.100(A) (6), (7), and, if applicable, (8) shall be required; or

b. An alternative mitigation plan (e.g., a proposal to create an alternative plant community type such as an oak savannah or a low-structure plant community, or where an applicant demonstrates that a portion of identified HCA on the subject property provides only impaired ecological functions) may be approved, subject to the following criteria:

i. The mitigation plan shall demonstrate that it compensates for significant detrimental impacts to the ecological functions provided by the HCA on the subject property, after taking into consideration efforts to minimize such significant detrimental impacts through the use of the techniques described in Table 8 and through any additional or innovative techniques.

ii. Mitigation shall occur on the subject property, except that offsite mitigation may be approved pursuant to Subsection 17.25.100(A)(7)(b).

iii. All mitigation plantings shall be native vegetation.

iv. All in-stream work in fish-bearing streams shall be done in accordance with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in-stream work-timing schedule.

v. A mitigation maintenance plan shall be included and shall be sufficient to ensure the success of the planting.

4. Municipal potable water, stormwater (drainage), and wastewater utility facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants, raw water intakes, pump stations, transmission mains, conduits or service lines, terminal storage reservoirs, and outfall devices, shall not have to comply with Subsection 17.25.100(B)(1), provided that:

a. Where practicable, the development shall not encroach closer to a water resource than existing operations and development, or for new projects where there are no existing operations or development, the development shall not encroach closer to a water resource than practicable; and

b. Best management practices shall be employed that accomplish the following:

i. Account for watershed assessment information in project design;

ii. Minimize the trench area and tree removal within the HCA;

iii. Utilize and maintain erosion prevention and sediment control measures until other site stabilization measures are established, post-construction;

iv. Replant immediately after backfilling or as soon as effective;

v. Preserve wetland soils and retain soil profiles;

vi. Minimize compactions and the duration of the work within the HCA;

vii. Complete in-water construction during appropriate seasons, or as approved within requisite state or federal permits;

viii. Monitor water quality during the construction phases, if applicable; and

ix. Implement a full inspection and monitoring program during and after project completion, if applicable.


17.25.110 Setbacks.

For parcels that contain a Habitat Conservation Area, the minimum front, rear, and side yard setbacks shall be zero, except:

A. Garages and carports shall comply with the minimum front yard setback of the underlying zoning district; and

B. A greater setback may be required to comply with applicable fire or life safety requirements.

17.27.010 Purpose.

(1) The purpose of the Water Quality Resource Area (WQ) District is to implement the Comprehensive Plan, to protect and improve water quality, to support beneficial water uses, and to protect the functions and values of existing and newly established water quality resource areas that provide a vegetated corridor to separate protected water features from development. The vegetated corridor assists in many functions, including but not limited to, the following:

(a) Maintaining or reducing stream temperatures;

(b) Maintaining natural stream corridors;

(c) Reducing potential sediment, nutrient and pollutant loading into water;

(d) Providing filtration, infiltration and natural water purification; and

(e) Stabilizing slopes to prevent landslides contributing to sedimentation of water features.

Statutory Reference: ORS

History: Ord. 1334 §3 (Part), 2002.


17.27.020 Applicability.

(1) This chapter shall apply to development in the WQ district. The WQ district is composed of water quality resource areas and is an overlay district. “Water quality resource areas” means vegetated corridors and the adjacent protected water features as established by this chapter.

(2) A wetland shall be a primary protected water feature if the wetland meets any one of the following criteria and is not a constructed wetland:

(a) The wetland is fed by surface flows, sheet flows, or precipitation, and has evidence of flooding during the growing season, and has 60 percent or greater vegetative cover, and is over one-half acre in size;

(b) The wetland qualifies as having “intact water quality function” under the 1996 Oregon Freshwater Wetland Assessment Methodology;

(c) The wetland is in the Flood Management Area District, and has evidence of flooding during the growing season, and is five acres or more in size, and has a restricted outlet or no outlet;

(d) The wetland qualifies as having “intact hydrologic control function” under the 1996 Oregon Freshwater Wetland Assessment Methodology;

(e) The wetland or a portion of it is within a horizontal distance of less than one-fourth mile from a water body that meets the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s definition of a “water quality limited water body.”

(3) Other primary protected water features include all rivers and perennial streams, intermittent streams draining greater than 100 acres, natural lakes, and springs that feed streams and wetlands and have year-round flow. Secondary protected water features include all intermittent streams draining 100 acres or less.

(4) The minimum required width of the vegetated corridor is specified in Table 1.

(a) At least three slope measurements along the water feature, at no more than 100-foot increments, shall be made for each property for which development is proposed. Depending on the slope measurements, the width of the vegetated corridor may vary.

(b) To establish the width of the vegetated corridor, slope shall be measured in 25-foot increments away from the water feature until slope is less than 25 percent or a point 150 feet from the starting point of measurement is reached, whichever occurs first.

(c) If an improved, public road right-of-way runs parallel to and is included within a water quality resource area as defined above, the water quality resource area shall not extend beyond the improved, public road right-of-way.

Table 1 

	Protected Water Feature Type	Slope Adjacent to Protected Water Feature	Starting Point for Measurements from Water Feature	Width of Vegetated Corridor

	Primary Protected Water Feature	<25 percent	*Edge of bankfull stage *Delineated edge of protected wetland	50 feet

	Primary Protected Water Feature	=25 percent for 150 feet or more	*Edge of bankfull stage *Delineated edge of protected wetland	200 feet1

	Primary Protected Water Feature	=25 percent for less than 150 feet	*Edge of bankfull stage *Delineated edge of protected wetland	Distance from starting point of measurement to break in 25 percent slope plus 50 feet1, 2, 3

	Secondary Protected Water Feature	<25 percent	*Edge of bankfull stage	15 feet

	Secondary Protected Water Feature	=25 percent	*Edge of bankfull stage	50 feet1

	1    Vegetated corridors in excess of 50 feet for primary protected features, or in excess of 15 feet for secondary protected features, apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from the protected water feature.

2    Where the protected water feature is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of the ravine is the break in the greater-than-25-percent slope.

3    A maximum reduction of 25 feet may be permitted in the width of the vegetated corridor beyond the slope break if a geotechnical report demonstrates that the slope is stable.

 

(5) The text of this chapter shall determine whether development is located in the WQ district.

(a) Map 12 (Water Quality Resource Areas) of the Comprehensive Plan shall be a reference for identifying areas likely to be located in the WQ district. The map identifies protected water features generally, but does not map the boundaries of the features. Because the text of this chapter controls and the map is reference only, there may be water features not shown on the map that require protection pursuant to the text.

(b) If, in the course of a development review, evidence suggests that a property may contain a water quality resource area, the provisions of this chapter shall be applied to that development review. Additionally, the standards of GMC Section 17.27.080 (map administration) shall be applied and, if the standards are met, the WQ district boundaries shall be amended.

(A) However, neither the provisions of this chapter nor the standards of the GMC Section 17.27.080 shall be applied when, pursuant to the review of an application for a building permit, evidence suggests that a property may contain a water quality resource area not referenced on Map 12 (Water Quality Resource Areas) of the Comprehensive Plan.

(c) If, in the course of a development review, evidence suggests that a property may contain a vegetative corridor protecting a water feature lying outside of the city limits, and the protected water feature is identified on the respective jurisdiction’s Title 3 Water Quality Resource Areas Map, the provisions of this chapter shall be applied to that development review.

(6) Pursuant to GMC Subsection 17.27.042 (2) and Division VII (administrative procedures), applicants for development on a site presumed to be within the WQ district may request a determination that the subject site is not in the district and thus is not subject to the standards of this chapter.

(7) A determination by the city under the standards of this chapter shall not excuse the applicant from satisfying any state and federal requirements that are otherwise applicable.

(8) This chapter does not apply to work necessary to protect, repair, maintain or replace existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies provided that after the emergency has passed, adverse impacts are mitigated in accordance with Table 2.

Statutory Reference: ORS

History: Ord. 1334 §3 (Part), 2002.


17.27.030 Administration.

(1) Applications for subdivisions, partitions, planned unit developments, conditional uses, variances under GMC Chapter 17.72 (variances), alterations, expansions or changes of use of nonconforming uses, greenway conditional uses and design review shall demonstrate compliance with this chapter as part of the review proceedings for those developments.

(2) Uses identified in GMC Subsection 17.27.040(3) and not subject to review as a subdivision, partition, planned unit development, conditional use, variance under GMC Chapter 17.72 (variances), alteration, expansion or change of use of a nonconforming use, greenway conditional use or design review may be approved under a WQ district permit pursuant to GMC Division VII (administrative procedures) and the provisions of this chapter.

(g) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

(h) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and

(i) To protect Flood Management Areas, which provide the following functions:

(A) Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding;

(B) Flood storage, reduction of flood velocities, reduction of flood peak flows and reduction of wind and wave impacts;

(C) Maintain water quality by reducing and sorting sediment loads, processing chemical and organic wastes and reducing nutrients;

(D) Recharge, store and discharge groundwater; and

(E) Provide plant and animal habitat and support riparian ecosystems.

Statutory Reference: ORS

History: Ord. 1334 §4 (Part), 2002.


17.29.020 Applicability.

(1) This chapter shall apply to development in the FM district. The FM district includes all flood management areas and is an overlay district.

(2) The standards that apply in the FM district apply in addition to state and federal restrictions governing flood management areas.

Statutory Reference: ORS

History: Ord. 1334 §4 (Part), 2002.


17.29.030 Basis for establishing flood management areas.

(1) The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled Flood Insurance Study, Clackamas County, Oregon and Incorporated Areas dated June 17, 2008, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The flood insurance study is on file at the Clackamas County Department of Transportation and Development and the office of the City Recorder in the City Hall. For areas annexed to the city, the flood insurance study, with accompanying maps, of Clackamas County, Oregon shall govern until such time as the city’s study and/or maps are updated by FEMA.

(2) When base flood elevation data has not been provided in A and V zones by the above-referenced study and maps, the city shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state or other sources, in order to administer GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6) and GMC Section 17.29.140.

(3) Flood management areas also include lands that have physical or documented evidence of flooding within recorded history, including areas of inundation for the February 1996 flood. The most recent and technically accurate information available, such as aerial photographs of the 1996 flooding and digitized flood elevation maps, shall be used to determine the historical flood area.

(4) Map 13 (Flood Management Areas) of the Comprehensive Plan shall be a reference for identifying areas likely to be located in the FM district. The map identifies flood management areas generally. Because the text of this chapter controls and the map is a reference only, there may be flood management areas not shown on the map that are regulated pursuant to the text.

(5) If, in the course of a development review, evidence suggests that a property may contain a flood management area not shown on Map 13 (Flood Management Areas) of the Comprehensive Plan, the provisions of this chapter shall be applied to that development review. Additionally, the standards of the GMC Section 17.29.080 (map administration) shall be applied and, if the standards are met, the FM district boundaries shall be amended.

17.29.090 Variances and appeals.

(1) To ensure that compliance with this chapter does not cause unreasonable hardship, including depriving an owner of all economically viable use of land, the requirements of this chapter may be varied.

(2) Variance applications shall be reviewed pursuant to GMC Division VII (administrative procedures) and the provisions of this chapter.

(3) Metro shall be notified of a variance application and within seven days of a decision on the variance.

(4) Variance approval shall be granted only if the following criteria are satisfied:

(a) The only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be approved is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(b) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

(c) Variances shall not be approved within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(d) Variances shall only be approved upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(e) Variances shall only be issued upon:

(A) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(B) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

(C) A determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(f) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

(g) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except GMC Subsection 17.29.090(4)(a) and otherwise complies with GMC Subsection 17.29.100(5)(a).

(h) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(i) The variance shall be the minimum necessary to allow the proposed use or activity;

(j) The variance shall not increase danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;

(k) The impact of the increase in flood hazard, which will result from the variance, shall not prevent the city from meeting the requirements of this chapter. In support of this criterion, the applicant shall have a qualified professional engineer document the expected height, velocity and duration of floodwaters and estimate the rate of increase in sediment transport of the floodwaters expected both downstream and upstream as a result of the variance;

(l) The variance shall not increase the cost of providing and maintaining public services during and after flood conditions so as to unduly burden public agencies and taxpayers; and

(m) In approving a variance, all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the following shall be considered:

(A) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(B) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(C) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(D) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(E) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(F) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(G) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(H) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for the area;

(I) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(J) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(K) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

(5) Conditions deemed necessary to further the purposes of this chapter may be attached to a variance approval.

(6) The Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the City Administrator or designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Such appeals shall be processed pursuant to GMC Division VII (administrative procedures).

(7) The City Recorder shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and the City Administrator or designee shall report any approved variances to the Federal Insurance Administration or FEMA upon request.

17.29.100 Standards.

(1) The following uses are allowed outright:

(a) Excavation and fill required to plant any new trees or vegetation, provided such activities do not constitute development;

(b) Restoration or enhancement of floodplains, riparian areas, wetlands, upland and streams that meet federal and state standards, provided that any project which encroaches in the floodway complies with GMC Section 17.29.140 (floodways).

(2) All uses allowed in the underlying zoning district are allowed subject to compliance with the standards of this chapter.

(3) The following uses are prohibited:

(a) Any use prohibited in the underlying zoning district;

(b) Uncontained areas of hazardous materials as defined by the Department of Environmental Quality.

(4) All development in the FM District shall conform to the following balanced cut and fill standards:

(a) This subsection does not apply to work necessary to protect, repair or maintain existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies provided that, after the emergency has passed, adverse impacts are mitigated in accordance with applicable standards.

(b) No net fill in any floodplain is allowed. All fill placed in a floodplain shall be balanced with at least an equal amount of soil material removal. For the purposes of calculating net fill, fill shall include any structure below the design flood elevation that has been floodproofed pursuant to GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6)(b). Such information shall be certified by an engineer.

(c) Any excavation below bankfull stage shall not count toward compensating for fill.

(d) Excavation to balance a fill shall be located on the same parcel as the fill unless it is not practicable to do so. In such cases, the excavation shall be located in the same Gladstone floodplain, so long as the proposed excavation and fill will not increase flood impacts for surrounding properties as determined through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis.

(e) For excavated areas identified by the city to remain dry in the summer, such as parks or mowed areas, the lowest elevation of the excavated area shall be at least six inches above the winter “low water” elevation, and sloped at a minimum of two percent towards the protected water feature pursuant to GMC Chapter 17.27 (WQ – water quality resource area district). One percent slopes will be allowed in smaller areas.

(f) For excavated areas identified by the city to remain wet in the summer, such as a constructed wetland, the grade shall be designed not to drain into the protected water feature pursuant to GMC Chapter 17.27 (WQ – water quality resource area district).

(g) Minimum finished floor elevations shall be at least one foot above the design flood elevation or highest flood of record, whichever is higher, for new habitable structures in the flood area.

(h) Parking areas in the floodplain shall be accompanied by signs that inform the public that the parking area is located in a flood management area and that care should be taken when the potential for flooding exists.

(i) Temporary fills permitted during construction shall be removed at the end of construction, 30 days after subdivision acceptance or completion of the final inspection.

(j) New culverts, stream crossings and transportation projects shall be designed as balanced cut and fill projects or designed not to significantly raise the design flood elevation. Such projects shall be designed to minimize the area of fill in the FM District and to minimize erosive velocities. Stream crossings shall be as close to perpendicular to the stream as practicable. Bridges shall be used instead of culverts wherever practicable.

(k) Excavation and fill required for the construction of detention facilities or structures, and other facilities, such as levees, specifically shall be designed to reduce or mitigate flood impacts and improve water quality. Such information shall be certified by an engineer. Levees shall not be used to create vacant buildable lands.

(5) The following construction standards shall apply in all flood management areas:

(a) Anchoring.

(A) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.

(B) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Additional techniques may be found in FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” publication.

(b) Construction Materials and Methods.

(A) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

(B) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(C) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(c) Utilities.

(A) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.

(B) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters.

(C) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

(6) In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided (Zones A, AH and AE) as set forth in GMC Subsections 17.29.030(1) and (2), the following provisions are required:

(a) Residential Construction.

(A) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above the design flood elevation.

(B) The following standards apply to Below-Grade Crawl Spaces:

(i) The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through the required openings stated in Section (ii) below. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater that five (5) feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer. Other types of foundations are recommended for these areas.

(ii) The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation (BFE) and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more that one (1) foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade.

(iii) Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE. The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above BFE.

(iv) Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.

(v) The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two (2) feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade.

(vi) The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four (4) feet in any point. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas.

(vii) There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means.

(viii) The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five (5) feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five (5) feet per second, other foundation types should be used.

(C) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited unless they are designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(D) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, shall comply with GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6)(a)(B); and

(E) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the design flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).

(b) Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at or above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

(A) Be floodproofed so that below the design flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, provided that the requirements of GMC Subsection 17.29.100 (4)(b) are met;

(B) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

(C) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided pursuant to GMC Subsection 17.29.070(2)(b)(B);

(D) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, shall comply with GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6)(a)(B); and

(E) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the design flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).

(c) Manufactured Homes.

(A) Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on-sites that are outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood , shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

(B) Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6)(c)(A) shall be elevated so that either:

(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement; or

(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than three feet in height above grade and is securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

(d) Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall:

(A) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

(B) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

(C) Comply with GMC Subsection 17.29.100(6)(c) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.

17.29.110 Review of building permits.

Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM or pursuant to GMC Subsection 17.29.030(2), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness shall be made by the City Administrator or designee, considering use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available, and the provisions of this chapter. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

17.29.140 Floodways.

(1) Located within areas of special flood hazard established in GMC Section 17.29.030 (basis for establishing flood management areas) are areas designated as floodways. Because the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(a) Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(b) New construction and substantial improvements shall comply with the applicable standards of GMC Sections 17.29.100 (standards), 17.29.110 (review of building permits) and 17.29.120 (subdivision standards).

17.44.010 Applicability.

Building siting and design standards shall apply to all development that is subject to design review.

Statutory Reference: ORS Ch. 197 and 227

History: Ord. 1131 §2, 1990; Ord. 1289 §1, 2000.


17.44.020 General standards.

Building siting and design standards are as follows:

(1) Siting. Where there are no conflicts with other design standards or requirements in this Title, site buildings to maximize solar access where practical, using such techniques as:

(a) Maximizing east-west street length so that principal building façades will face south;

(b) Orienting buildings within twenty degrees of true south as well as maximizing their south-facing dimension;

(c) Placing higher buildings on the north portion of the site, while protecting solar access for adjacent sites;

(d) Placing major yard spaces on south side of buildings.

(2) Energy Efficient Design. Where there are no conflicts with other design standards or requirements in this Title, design buildings that are conducive to energy efficiency and conservation, using techniques including, but not limited to, those listed below which are most appropriate to the development:

(a) Concentrate window areas on the south side (within twenty degrees of true south) of buildings where there is good southern exposure, and provide overhangs, balconies, or other shading devices to prevent excessive summer heat gains;

(b) Use architectural features, shapes or buildings, fences, natural landforms, berms and vegetation to catch and direct summer breezes for natural cooling and minimize effects of winter winds;

(c) Provide skylights or clerestory windows to provide natural lighting and/or solar heating of interior spaces.

(3) Compatibility. Arrange structures and use areas to be compatible with adjacent developments and surrounding land uses, considering the following design and siting techniques:

(a) Locate and design structures to protect scenic views or vistas from adjacent properties and public thoroughfares. Setbacks, building height and bulk should be considered;

(b) Design structures to provide visual order and avoid monotony in layout and design;

(c) Orient major service activity areas (e.g., loading and delivery areas) of the proposed project away from existing residences;

(d) Provide opaque enclosures and gates for all refuse storage areas;

(e) Screen mechanical equipment, except solar collection apparatus, from view or place such equipment in locations where it will not be viewed by the public. Screening shall be accomplished by the use of a sight-obscuring fence or hedge, a landscaped earth berm, building placement or other design techniques;

(f) Buffering and/or screening shall be used to mitigate adverse visual impacts, dust, noise and pollution, and to provide for compatibility between dissimilar adjoining uses. Special consideration will be given to the buffering, screening and siting of commercial and industrial uses to ensure that noise and odors are not detectable to normal sensory perception on adjacent residential properties. All development shall comply with GMC Chapter 8.12 (noise control).

(4) Building Materials. Buildings shall be constructed using high-image exterior materials and finishes such as masonry, architecturally treated tilt-up concrete, glass, wood or stucco. Buildings shall not be constructed with metal siding material, except as approved by the design review committee for specific high-image materials, except for:

(a) Canopies, awnings, screening for roof-mounted fixtures, or other architectural features:

(b) Utility equipment cabinets:

(c) Structures no greater than two hundred (200) square feet in floor area and ten (10) feet in height: and,

(d) Buildings, the portions of buildings, that are not visible from a road or adjacent property.

(5) Lighting. Adequate exterior lighting shall be provided to protect public safety and shall be deflected so as not to shine on a lot in a residential district.

(6) On-site Lighting. All on-site lighting shall be designed, located, shielded, or deflected so as not to shine into off-site structures or impair the vision of the driver of any vehicle. When required, engineered site lighting plans shall be developed consistent with Illuminating Engineering Standards (IES) including, but not limited to, average maintained illumination and maximum to minimum ratios. A master plan for on-site lighting shall include the design, height, and location of all proposed exterior lights, including:

(a) Parking and loading area lighting;

(b) Pedestrian walkway lighting;

(c) Internal access road lighting;

(d) Lighting of public entrances into buildings;

(e) Flood lights illuminating buildings or significant natural features.

(7) Equipment and Facilities. All utility lines shall be placed underground. All roof-mounted fixtures and utility cabinets or similar equipment which must be installed above ground shall be visually screened from public view.

(8) Trash Disposal and Recycling Collection. In addition to the preceding standards, new construction requiring full site plan review shall incorporate functional and adequate space for on-site storage and efficient collection of mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables prior to pick-up and removal by haulers.

(a) Minimum storage area for trash and recyclables shall be established by one of the following methods: minimum standards method or franchise hauler review method.

(A) Franchise Hauler Review Method. The applicant shall submit plans for storage and collection of solid waste and recyclables that are acceptable to the city’s franchise solid waste hauler; acceptance may be indicated on the site plan and/or by separate attachment; or

(B) Minimum Standards Method. The applicant shall submit plans for storage of solid waste and recyclables in accordance with the following:

(i) Multi-family complexes containing ten (10) or fewer dwelling units shall provide a minimum fifty (50) square feet; developments containing more than ten (10) residential units shall provide an additional five (5) square feet per dwelling unit above ten (10).

(ii) Nonresidential developments shall provide a minimum storage area of ten (10) square feet plus:

(aa)  office – 4 square feet /1,000 square feet gross floor area (GFA)

(bb) retail – 10 square feet /1,000 square feet GFA

(cc) wholesale/warehouse/manufacturing – 6 square feet /1,000 square feet GFA

(dd) educational & institutional – 4 square feet / 1,000 square feet GFA

(ee) Other – 4 square feet /1,000 square feet GFA

(C) The storage area requirement is based on the predominate use of the building, as described above in subparagraph (a)(B)(ii) of this subsection. If a building has more than one use and that use occupies twenty percent (20%) or less of the floor area of the building, the floor area occupied by that use shall be counted toward the floor area of the predominate use. If a building has more than one of the uses listed in subparagraph (a)(B)(ii) of this subsection, and that use occupies more than twenty percent (20%) of the floor area of the building, then the storage area requirement for the whole building shall be the sum of the requirement for the area of each use.

(D) The specific requirements shall meet the Uniform Fire Code and are based on an assumed storage height of four feet (4’) for solid waste/recyclables. Vertical storage higher than four feet (4’) but not higher than seven feet (7’) may be used to accommodate the same volume of storage in a reduced floor space.

(9) Temporary Structures. All temporary structures:

(a) Shall be located behind the front building line of the primary structure and shall meet the setback requirements for accessory structures of the underlying zoning district. On corner lots the streetside setback can be reduced to five feet.

(b) Exceptions to these standards may be made by the Planning Department for temporary storage of materials as long as the temporary structure is removed within 15 days, is not erected for more than 30 days in one calendar year and is not seen as a nuisance to the city. Any temporary structures for current activities, such as lemonade stands, gardening, temporary mechanical repair, temporary storage, and other similar activities, would be subject to this same provision.

(c) This section shall apply to all temporary structures in place after the effective date of this section.

(d) Any temporary structure will be secured per manufacturer’s instructions for proper anchoring.

17.48.030 Standards for developments subject to design review.

At the time of construction, enlargement, or change of use of any structure or development subject to GMC Chapter 17.80 (Design Review), except as provided in the C-2 district, off-street parking spaces shall be provided as follows unless greater requirements are otherwise established under this title:

(1) Calculation of Parking Requirements.

(a) Square Footage as Basis for Requirement. Where square feet of the structure or use is specified as the basis for the parking requirement, the calculation shall be based on the gross leasable area (GLA).

(b) Number of Employees as Basis of Requirement. When the number of employees is specified as the basis for the parking space requirement, the calculation shall be based on the number of employees working on the premises during the largest shift at peak season.

(c) If more than one use occupies a single structure or lot, the total minimum and maximum parking requirements for the structure or lot shall be the sum of the requirements for all uses. Where it can be shown that the peak parking demands are actually less (i.e., the uses operate on different days or at different times of the day), the total requirements may be reduced accordingly to the use with highest minimum parking requirement.

(d) When calculation of a minimum or maximum parking requirement results in a fractional space requirement, such fraction shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(e) Owners of two or more uses, structures or lots may agree to utilize jointly the same parking and loading spaces when the peak hours of operation do not substantially overlap. Satisfactory legal evidence shall be presented to establish the joint use. Shared parking spaces shall be included in the calculation of the minimum parking requirement for each of the joint users. For the purpose of calculating the maximum permitted parking for each of the joint users, shared spaces shall be apportioned between the joint users.

(f) On-street parking may count towards fulfilling up to one-quarter of the off-street parking requirements where on-street parking is allowed and the applicant can demonstrate that on-street parking is available. On-street parking must be available on the subject site’s frontage in order to be credited towards the off-street parking requirement. On-street parking credited for a specific use may not be used exclusively by that use, but shall be available for general public use at all times. No signs or actions limiting general public use of on-street spaces is permitted.

(g) Parking spaces fulfilling the minimum off-street parking space requirement shall not be used for display or storage and shall not be rented, leased or assigned to any other person or organization, except as authorized under subsection (l)(e) of this section.

(h) Off-Site Parking. Except for single-family dwellings, the vehicle parking spaces required by this chapter may be located on another parcel of land, provided the parcel is within 500 feet walking distance of the use it serves. The distance from the parking area to the use shall be measured from the nearest parking space to a building entrance, following a sidewalk or other pedestrian route. The right to use the off-site parking must be evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, easement, or similar written instrument.

(2) Minimum and maximum permitted parking.

(a) The number of surface parking spaces provided at no charge for a particular use shall not be less than the minimum nor exceed the maximum parking ratios identified for that use in Table 1. Minimum parking ratios for those uses not identified in Table 1 (below) shall be determined by the Planning commission during design review.

(b) For purposes of the maximum parking ratios identified in Table 1 (below), Zone A shall include those areas where 20-minute peak hour transit service is provided within a one-quarter (1/4) mile walking distance for bus transit stops or stations or one-half (1/2) mile walking distance for high capacity transit stops or stations. Zone B shall include all other areas.

(c) The following types of parking spaces are exempt from the maximum parking ratios:

(A) Parking spaces in parking structures;

(B) Fleet parking spaces;

(C) Parking spaces used to store vehicles that are for sale, lease or rent;

(D) Employee carpool parking spaces that are clearly delineated with signs;

(E) Dedicated valet parking spaces.

(d) Upon expansion of a nonconforming development or nonconforming use that does not comply with minimum or maximum parking ratios, additional parking spaces shall be provided as follows:

(A) If the existing number of parking spaces is less than the minimum parking ratio in Table 1 (below), the number of additional parking spaces required shall be based only on the floor area or capacity added and not on the area or capacity existing prior to the expansion.

(B) If the existing number of parking spaces exceeds the maximum parking ratio in Table 1 (below), additional parking spaces may only be provided if compliance with the maximum parking ratio will be met for the entire development or use following the expansion.

(e) Exceptions to the minimum and maximum parking ratios may be granted pursuant to GMC Section 17.80.090 (minor exception). Exceptions exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the requirement shall be subject to GMC Chapter 17.72 (variances).

17.48.040 Design requirements for permanent off-street parking and loading.

All structures and developments subject to design review shall provide permanent off-street parking and loading as follows:

(1) Parking and Loading:

(a) Parking and loading areas shall be paved with asphalt and/or concrete meeting city standards, maintained adequately for all weather use and so drained as to avoid flow of water across public sidewalks;

(b) Off-street parking and loading areas shall be screened from abutting properties located in a residential zoning district unless such abutting properties are developed with nonresidential uses. Required screening shall be accomplished by building placement, a landscaped earth berm or a sight-obscuring fence or hedge. Required screening shall be a minimum of six feet high and shall not conflict with GMC Chapter 17.54 (clear vision).

(c) Areas for standing and maneuvering vehicles, other than for the off-street parking and storage of truck tractors and/or semitrailers, shall be paved with an asphalt and/or concrete surface meeting city standards. The parking of truck tractors and/or semitrailers in off-street parking areas used exclusively for the parking and/or storage of said vehicles may be allowed utilizing a durable and dustless surface other than an asphalt and/or concrete surface. Such surface must be graded, compacted and surfaced in such a manner that it will adequately support these vehicles, including trailer standing gear, will not produce dust, will not produce tracking of mud or other materials onto adjoining streets or properties, and otherwise complies with other applicable provisions of this code.

(2) Parking:

(a) Required parking spaces shall be located not further than 200 feet from the building or use they are required to serve, measured in a straight line from the building;

(b) Required parking shall be provided in the same zoning district or a different zoning district of a more intensive use;

(c) In no case shall required parking for a commercial or industrial use be provided in a residential district, except for approved conditional uses;

(d) Groups of more than four parking spaces shall be permanently marked and so located and served by driveways that their use will require no backing movements or other maneuvering within a street right- of-way other than an alley;

(e) Parking spaces along the outer boundaries of a parking lot shall be contained by a curb at least four inches high and setback a minimum of five feet from the property line. A bumper rail may be substituted for a curb;

(f) Off-street parking and loading areas, including parking spaces and access aisles, shall meet or exceed the minimum dimensional standards identified in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1 (of this chapter). Access aisles shall be of sufficient width for all vehicular turning and maneuvering;

(g) Up to 50 percent of required parking spaces may be provided for compact cars;

(h) Parking areas shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid large, uninterrupted rows of parking spaces.

(3) Loading:

(a) A driveway designed for continuous forward flow of passenger vehicles for the purpose of loading and unloading passengers shall be located on the site of any school having a capacity greater than 25 students;

(b) Buildings or structures to be built or substantially altered which receive and distribute material or merchandise by truck shall provide and maintain off-street loading berths in sufficient numbers and size to adequately handle the needs of the particular use. If loading space has been provided in connection with an existing use or is added to an existing use, the loading space shall not be eliminated if elimination would result in less space than is required to adequately handle the needs of the particular use;

(c) Off-street parking areas used to fulfill the requirements of this section shall not be used for loading and unloading operations except during periods of the day when not required to take care of parking needs;

(d) Loading facilities shall be located at least 20 feet from residential property. Loading spaces shall be located on the site and directly accessible to the main structure.

(e) Exceptions and Adjustments. Loading areas within a street right-of-way in areas zoned mixed-use commercial in the C-2 zoning district may be approved when all of the following conditions are met: 

(A) Loading areas must be signed to limit the duration of the activity, which may not exceed one hour for each loading operation.

(B) Proposed loading areas must support a use that requires infrequent loading activity. Infrequent loading activity is defined as less than three operations that occur daily between 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m., or all operations that occur between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. at a location that is not adjacent to a residential zone. 

(C) The proposed loading area:

(i) Does not unreasonably obstruct traffic; 

(ii) Will be limited to one loading activity at a time;

(A) All development shall have a minimum two short-term bicycle parking spaces; and

(B) If more than seven bicycle parking spaces are required, at least 50 percent of the spaces shall be provided as long-term bicycle parking. 

(C) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a)(A) of this section, 100 percent of all bicycle parking spaces for multi-family development of four units and more shall be provided as long-term bicycle parking.

(2) Location and Design.

(a) Short-Term Bicycle Parking. Short-term bicycle parking facilities are lockers or racks that meet the standards of this section and that are located inside a building, or located outside within 30 feet of the main entrance to the building or at least as close as the nearest vehicle parking space, whichever is closer;

(b) Long-Term Bicycle Parking. Long-term bicycle parking includes:

(A) Racks, storage rooms, or lockers in areas that are secure or monitored (e.g., visible to employees or customers or monitored by security). 

(B) Covered outside bicycle parking spaces that meet the requirements of subsection (2)(g) of this section and are located within 100 feet of an entrance to the building;

(c) Signs. If the bicycle parking is not visible from the street or main building entrance, then a sign conforming to the city’s standards for on-site traffic control, GMC Section 17.52.060(1), shall be posted indicating the location of the parking facilities;

(d) Rack Type and Dimensions.

(A) Bicycle racks must hold bicycles securely by the frame and be securely anchored;

(B) Bicycle racks must accommodate:

(i) Locking the frame and one wheel to the rack with a high-security U-shaped shackle lock, or approved substitute; or

(ii) Locking the frame and both wheels to the rack with a chain or cable not longer than six feet;

(C) The Planning Commission may approve alternate bicycle racks provided they are convenient and secure;

(e) Bicycle parking spaces must be at least six feet long and two feet wide. An aisle five feet wide for bicycle maneuvering must be provided;

(f) Areas set aside for required bicycle parking must be clearly marked and reserved for bicycle parking only;

(g) Covered Parking (Weather Protection).

(A) When required, covered bicycle parking shall be provided in one of the following ways: inside buildings, under roof overhangs or awnings, in bicycle lockers, or within or under other structures.

(B) Where required covered bicycle parking is not proposed to be located within a building or locker, the cover must be permanent and designed to protect the bicycle from rainfall and provide seven-foot minimum overhead clearance.

(C) Where required bicycle parking is provided in lockers, the lockers shall be securely anchored.

17.50.020 Vehicular and pedestrian circulation generally.

Vehicular and pedestrian circulation facilities, including walkways, provisions for the handicapped, interior drives and parking as provided under GMC Chapter 17.48 (off-street parking and loading), shall be designated as follows:

(1) Impervious Surface. Provide for least amount of impervious surface necessary to adequately serve the type and intensity of proposed land uses within developments as well as providing adequate access for service vehicles.

(2) Traffic Separation. Provide when feasible, a separation of motor vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.

(3) Curbs and Sidewalks. Provide curbs, associated drainage, and sidewalks within the right-of-way or easement for public roads and streets.

(4) Traffic Volume Expansion. Provision shall be made to accommodate any increased volume of traffic resulting from the development consistent with GMC Section 17.50.050. If streets adjacent to or serving the site are inadequate, widening, dedication of property for future widening, or other street improvements may be required. The development shall be designed to minimize traffic volume increases on minor streets and underdeveloped streets.

(5) Handicapped Needs. Provide for the special needs of the handicapped such as wheelchair ramps and Braille signs.

(6) Pedestrian Circulation Standards. An on-site pedestrian circulation system shall be provided for new nonresidential and multi-family developments and for new buildings added to existing nonresidential and multi-family developments. The system may include sidewalks as part of the public rights-of-way, walkways, and multi-use paths. (Walkways only provide for pedestrian circulation; multi-use pathways accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.) The system shall comply with the following standards:

(a) The system shall connect all adjacent streets to the main entrances of nonresidential buildings and to unit and/or building entrances of multi-family developments;

(b) The system shall connect all buildings and other areas of the site, such as parking areas, bicycle parking, recreational areas, common outdoor areas and any pedestrian amenities;

(c) The system shall be hard-surfaced and constructed in accordance with the public works standards. For nonresidential development, the walkways shall be a minimum of six feet wide. For multi-family residential development, walkways shall be a minimum of five feet wide;

(d) The system and off-street parking and loading areas shall be designed to avoid, to the maximum extent possible, the system’s crossing off-street parking and loading areas. Where the system crosses driveways or off-street parking and loading areas, the system shall be clearly identifiable through the use of elevation changes, speed bumps, a different paving material or other similar method. Striping shall not fulfill this requirement;

(e) Where the system is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, the system shall be a raised path or be separated from the auto travel lane by a raised curb, bollards, landscaping or other physical barrier. If a raised path is used, the ends of the raised portions shall be equipped with curb ramps;

(f) The system shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA);

(g) Walkways or multi-use paths shall be provided at or near midblock where the block length exceeds the length required by GMC Section 17.64.020.

Multi-use paths used to comply with these standards shall conform to all of the following criteria:

(A) Multi-use paths are required to be no less than 10 feet wide and located within a 20-foot-wide right-of-way or easement that allows access for emergency vehicles. 

(B) The city may require landscaping within the pathway easement/right-of-way for screening and the privacy of adjoining properties.

(C) The Planning Commission may determine, based upon facts in the record, that a walkway or multi-use pathway is impracticable due to: physical or topographic conditions (e.g., freeways, railroads, extremely steep slopes, sensitive lands, and similar physical constraints); buildings or other existing development on adjacent properties that physically prevent a connection now or in the future, considering the potential for redevelopment; and sites where the provisions of recorded leases, easements, covenants, restrictions, or other agreements recorded as of the effective date of this code prohibit the pathway connection.

(7) Proposed new industrial, institutional, multi-family retail and office developments requiring full site design review that are adjacent to or incorporate transit streets shall provide transit improvements at any existing or planned transit stop located along the site’s frontage consistent with the transit operator’s adopted long-range plan.

(a) Transit facilities include bus stops, shelters, and related facilities. Required transit facility improvements may include the dedication of land or the provision of a public easement.

(b) Development shall provide reasonably direct pedestrian connections between building entrances and adjacent transit facilities and between buildings on the site and streets with adjoining transit stops.

(c) Improvements at Major Bus Stops. A proposed development that is adjacent to or includes an existing or planned major bus stop will be required to plan for access to the transit stop and provide for transit improvements, in consultation with TriMet and consistent with an agency adopted or approved plan at the time of development. 

(A) Major bus stops are identified as part of the regional transit system and depicted in the Gladstone transportation system plan transit plan as “major bus stops.”

(B) Requirements apply where the subject parcel(s) or portions thereof are within 200 feet of a transit stop. Development requirements and improvements may include the following:

(i) Intersection or mid-block traffic management improvements to allow for pedestrian crossings at major transit stops.

(ii) Building placement within 20 feet of the transit stop, a transit street or an intersection street, or a pedestrian plaza at the stop or at street intersections.

(iii) Transit passenger landing pads accessible to disabled persons to transit agency standards.

(iv) An easement or dedication for a passenger shelter and an underground utility connection to a major transit stop if requested by TriMet.

(v) Lighting to TriMet standards.

(d) Any land divisions where further divisions are possible and multiple-family developments, community services uses, and commercial or industrial uses located on an existing or future planned frequent bus route shall meet the TriMet transit facility requirements. Applicants shall consult with TriMet to determine necessary transit facility improvements in conjunction with the proposed development. Proposals shall be consistent with the road crossing improvements that are identified in the transportation system plan on streets with existing or planned transit service.

17.50.030 Streets and roads generally.

(1) The location, width and grade of streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to the topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to the proposed use of land to be served by the streets. The street system shall assure an adequate traffic or circulation system with intersection angles, grades, tangents and curves appropriate for the traffic to be carried considering the terrain. Where location is now shown in a development plan, the arrangement of streets shall either:

(a) Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or

(b) Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical.

(2) For new residential and mixed-use development on vacant land of five acres or more in the R-5, R-7.2, MR and C-2 zoning districts, street connections and access ways shall be provided as follows:

(a) Full street connections shall be provided at intervals that are consistent with the adopted transportation system plan for the identified street classification, except where prevented by topography, barriers such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as major streams and rivers;

(b) Access ways for pedestrians, bicycles or emergency vehicles shall be provided on public easements or right-of-way where full street connections are not possible, with spacing between full streets or access way connections of not more than 330 feet, except where prevented by topography, barriers such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as major streams and rivers;

(c) A variance to street spacing standards may be granted pursuant to GMC Chapter 17.72 if resources are present that are mapped on the Natural Resources Map, where street spacing can be achieved at a minimum of 800 feet and no greater than 1,200 feet. Where habitat quality or the length of the crossing required prevents a full street connection, an exception to the street spacing standards may be granted, pursuant to GMC Chapter 17.72.

17.50.040 Street and road standards.

The design and improvement of streets within a development and streets adjacent but only partially within the development shall comply with improvement specifications adopted pursuant to GMC Section 17.42.030 and with the following standards:

(1) Right-of-Way and Roadway Widths.

(a) Minimum right-of-way and roadway widths shall conform to the standards found in Table 16 of the Gladstone transportation system plan, consistent with a street’s functional classification.

(b) The street cross-sections found in the Gladstone transportation system plan may be modified to accommodate alternative stormwater management methods subject to the approval of the Public Works Supervisor. The Public Works Supervisor may require modification of the typical cross section to accommodate alternative stormwater management methods when associated with development proposals. Such modifications may be applied as conditions of development approval.

(2) Alignment. All streets other than minor streets or cul-de-sacs, as far as practical, shall be in alignment with existing streets by continuations of the center lines thereof. The staggering of street alignments resulting in T intersections shall, wherever practical, leave a minimum distance of two hundred feet between the center lines of streets having approximately the same direction and otherwise shall not be less than 100 feet.

(3) Future Extension of Streets. Where necessary to give access to or permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall be extended to the boundary of the subdivision. The point where the streets temporarily end shall conform to the standards below: 

(a) Extended streets or street stubs to adjoining properties are not considered to be cul-de-sacs since they are intended to continue as through streets when the adjoining property is developed.

(b) A barricade (e.g., fence, bollards, boulders, or similar vehicle barrier) shall be constructed at the end of the street by the subdivider and shall not be removed until authorized by the city or other applicable agency with jurisdiction over the street. 

(c) Temporary turnarounds (e.g., hammerhead or bulb-shaped configuration) shall be constructed for stub streets over 150 feet in length.

(d) Temporary turnarounds shall be formed as an easement and will not affect building setback lines. The removal of a temporary turnaround shall occur when the street is extended and shall be paid for by the person extending the street. Reserve strips (street plugs) may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.

(e) In the case of dead-end stub streets that will connect to streets on adjacent sites in the future, notification that the street is planned for future extension shall be posted on the stub street until the street is extended and shall inform the public that the dead-end street may be extended in the future.

(4) Reserve Strips. Reserve strips or street plugs controlling the access to streets will not be approved unless necessary for the protection of the public welfare or of substantial property rights and in these cases they may be required. The control and disposal of the land composing such strips shall be placed within the jurisdiction of the city under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.

(5) Intersection Angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at angles as near to right angles as practical, except where topography requires lesser angles, but in no case less than 60° unless a special intersection design is approved. Streets shall have at least 50 feet of tangent adjacent to intersections unless topography requires lesser distances. Intersections which are not at right angles shall have minimum corner radii of 15 feet along right-of-way lines which form acute angles. Right-of-way lines at intersections with arterial streets shall have minimum curb radii of not less than 35 feet. Other street intersections shall have curb radii of not less than 20 feet. All radii shall maintain a uniform width between the roadway and the right-of-way lines. Ordinarily, the intersection of more than two streets at any one time will not be allowed.

(6) Existing Streets. Whenever existing streets adjacent to or within a tract are of inadequate widths, additional right-of-way shall be provided at the time of development.

(7) Cul-de-sacs and Hammerheads. The use of cul-de-sac designs and closed-end street systems shall be limited to situations where topography, existing development, barriers such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as major streams and rivers prevent full street extensions. If cul-de-sacs are used, they shall be as short as possible and shall have maximum lengths of 200 feet except where topography, existing development, barriers such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as major streams and rivers prevent full street extensions. Closed-end street systems shall serve no more than 25 single-family dwellings and terminate with adequate vehicle turnaround.

(8) Street Names. No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names and numbers shall conform to the established pattern in or near the city and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.

(9) Grades and Curves. Grades shall not exceed 10 percent on major or minor arterials, 15 percent on connector streets, or twenty percent on any other street unless specifically approved. In fault areas, finished street grades shall have a minimum slope of 0.5 percent. Center line radii of curves shall not be less than 300 feet on major arterials, 200 feet on minor arterials, or 100 feet on other streets. On arterials there shall be a tangent of not less than 100 feet between reversed curves.

(10) Marginal Access Streets. Where a land division abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with suitable depth, screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear or side property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and for separation of through and local traffic.

(11) Alleys. Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial districts unless other permanent provisions for access to off-street parking and loading facilities are made as approved by the Planning Commission. While alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, the corners of necessary alley intersections shall have radii of not less than 10 feet.

(12) Private Streets. Private streets may serve development where a finding can be made that such streets are of adequate width, alignment, grade and restricted length to afford the same degree of public safety as public streets and that extension of the public street system is impractical due to lot size or shape, topography, the location of existing structures to be retained or other similar circumstances and where no more than six dwelling units will take access from the private streets. In no case shall a private street be less than 20 feet in width. Greater width may be required where necessary to provide for public safety, accommodate traffic volume, or provide for underground utilities. A street maintenance agreement, acceptable to the city and duly recorded, shall be required.

(13) Painting of Curbs and Sidewalks. Except where required for safety purposes or for the identification of house numbers, painting of curbs and sidewalks is prohibited. All such painting must be approved by the city.

(14) Curbs and Driveways. Curb cuts and driveway installations shall be installed, according to city standards.

(15) Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of a public street and at any special pedestrian way within a development. The Planning Commission may approve a development with sidewalks on one side only of a local street if special site conditions exist or if alternative pedestrian routes are available, or if the proposed sidewalk is not likely to become part of a complete pedestrian route in the foreseeable future.

(16) Bicycle and Pedestrian Routes. Bicycle/pedestrian routes shall be required when consistent with Map 5 of the comprehensive plan and when necessary to provide a system of interconnecting walkways and safe, convenient access to a transit stop for a school, park, church, day care center, library, commercial center, community center or similar facility. Separate bicycle/pedestrian ways not located in a street right-of-way shall include a 10-foot wide paved surface within a 12-foot wide right-of-way, unless conditions warrant otherwise and shall be illuminated as required in GMC Section 17.44.020(6).

(17) Street Signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all street intersections. Specifications for signs shall be submitted and approved prior to their erection.

(18) Street Lights. Street lights shall be installed and shall be served from an underground source of supply.

(19) Storm Sewers. Catch basins shall be installed and connected to drainage tile leading to storm sewers or drainage ways.

(20) Monuments. Upon completion of street improvements, monuments shall be reestablished and protected in monument boxes at every street intersection and all points of curvature and points of tangency of street center lines. Elevation bench marks shall be established at each street intersection monument with elevations to U.S. Geological Survey datum. All lot corners will be marked by a metal rod.

17.50.050 Traffic impact analysis (TIA).

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement Sections 660-012-0045(2)(b) and 660-012-0045(2)(e) of the State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR), which require the city to adopt performance standards and a process to apply conditions to land use proposals in order to minimize impacts on and protect transportation facilities. This section establishes requirements for when a traffic impact analysis (TIA) must be prepared and submitted; the analysis methods and content involved in a TIA; criteria used to review the TIA; and authority to attach conditions of approval to minimize the impacts of the proposal on transportation facilities.

This section refers to the TSP for performance standards for transportation facilities as well as for projects that may need to be constructed as mitigation measures for a proposal’s projected impacts. This section also relies on the Gladstone Public Works Design Standards and Gladstone Public Works Standard Construction Specifications to provide street design standards and construction specifications for improvements and projects that may be constructed as part of the proposal and mitigation measures approved for the proposal.

(2) Applicability.

(a) Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA). A TIA shall be submitted to the city with a land use application at the request of the city Public Works Supervisor or if the proposal is expected to involve one or more of the following:

(A) An amendment to the Gladstone comprehensive plan or zoning map.

(B) ODOT requires a TIA in conjunction with a requested approach road permit, as specified in OAR 734-051-3030(4).

(C) The proposal generates 25 p.m. peak hour trips or more on the local transportation system.

(D) The location of an existing or proposed access driveway does not meet minimum spacing or sight distance requirements.

(E) A change in internal traffic patterns that may cause safety problems, such as back up onto the highway or traffic crashes in the approach area.

(b) Traffic Assessment Letter (TAL). A TAL shall be submitted to the city with a land use application if the provisions of subsection (2)(a) of this section do not apply. The city Public Works Supervisor may waive this requirement. The applicant’s traffic engineer shall submit a TAL to the city demonstrating that the proposed land use action is exempt from the TIA requirements. The letter shall outline the trip-generating characteristics of the proposed land use and verify that the site-access driveways or roadways meet Gladstone standards and that adequate sight distance is provided.

(3) Requirements. The following are typical requirements that may be modified in coordination with Public Works staff based on the specific application:

(a) Pre-Application Conference. The applicant shall meet with the Public Works Supervisor prior to submitting an application that requires a TIA. This meeting will be coordinated with Clackamas County and ODOT when an approach road to a county road or Highway 99E serves the property, so that the TIA will meet the requirements of all relevant agencies.

(b) Preparation. The TIA shall be prepared by an Oregon registered professional engineer qualified to perform traffic engineering analysis and will be paid for by the applicant.

(c) Typical Average Daily Trips and Peak Hour Trips. The latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), shall be used to gauge p.m. peak hour vehicle trips, unless a specific trip generation study that is approved by the city Public Works Supervisor indicates an alternative trip generation rate is appropriate.

(d) Intersection-Level Analysis. Intersection-level analysis shall be determined based on the methodologies identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

(e) Transportation Planning Rule Compliance. The requirements of OAR 660-012-0060 shall apply to those land use actions that significantly affect the transportation system, as defined by the Transportation Planning Rule.

(4) Study Area. The following facilities shall be included in the study area for all TIAs:

(a) All site-access points and intersections (signalized and unsignalized) adjacent to the proposed development site. If the site fronts an arterial or collector street, the analysis shall address all intersections and driveways along the site frontage and within the access spacing distances extending out from the boundary of the site frontage.

(b) Roads, streets, and accessways through and adjacent to the site.

(c) All intersections where the analysis shows that 10 percent or more of an approach volume can be expected to result from the development.

(d) In addition to these requirements, the city Public Works Supervisor may require analysis of any additional intersections or roadway links that are deemed necessary to address safety or operational concerns in proximity to the site.

(5) Analysis Periods. To adequately assess the impacts of a proposed land use action, the following study periods, or horizon years, should be addressed in the transportation impact analysis where applicable:

(a) Existing year.

(b) Background Conditions in Project Completion Year. The conditions in the year in which the proposed land use action will be completed and occupied, but without the expected traffic from the proposed land use action. This analysis should account for all city-approved developments that are expected to be fully built out in the proposed land use action horizon year, as well as all planned transportation system improvements.

(c) Full Build-Out Conditions in Project Completion Year. The background condition plus traffic from the proposed land use action assuming full build-out and occupancy.

(d) Phased Years of Completion. If the project involves construction or occupancy in phases, the applicant shall assess the expected roadway and intersection conditions resulting from major development phases. Phased years of analysis will be determined in coordination with city staff.

(e) Twenty-Year or TSP Horizon Year. For comprehensive plan amendments or zoning map amendments, the applicant shall assess the expected future roadway, intersection, and land use conditions as compared to approved comprehensive planning documents.

(6) Approval Criteria. When a TIA is required, a proposal is subject to the following criteria, in addition to all criteria otherwise applicable to the underlying land use proposal:

(a) The analysis complies with the requirements of GMC Section 17.50.020(4);

(b) The analysis demonstrates that adequate transportation facilities exist to serve the proposed development or identifies mitigation measures in a manner that is satisfactory to the city Public Works Supervisor or the Planning Commission when applicable, and, when county or state highway facilities are affected, to Clackamas County and ODOT;

(c) For affected nonhighway facilities, the TIA demonstrates that applicable performance standards established in the adopted transportation system plan have been met;

(d) Proposed public improvements are designed and will be constructed to the street standards specified in transportation system plan and the Gladstone Public Works Design Standards and Gladstone Public Works Standard Construction Specifications.

(7) Conditions of Approval. The city may deny, approve, or approve a development proposal with conditions needed to ensure transportation safety and operations standards and provide the necessary right-of-way and improvements to ensure consistency with the future planned transportation system. Improvements required as a condition of development approval, when not voluntarily provided by the applicant, shall be roughly proportional to the impact of the development on transportation facilities. Findings in the development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are directly related to and are roughly proportional to the impact of development.

(d) Duration. If an electronic message center sign displays a segmented message, the entire message must be completed within 10 seconds.

(e) Integration required. A changeable copy sign will only be permitted if it is part of a freestanding or on¦building sign. This subsection does not allow for such signs to be displayed independent of a freestanding or on¦building sign.

(4) Portable A-frame signs. Portable A-frame signs are allowed in commercial and industrial zones.

(a) Number. One A-frame sign is allowed per business. If no business exists on a parcel of property, then one A-frame sign is allowed for that property. If a business or property, as relevant, uses an A-frame sign, then a temporary sign under Section 17.52.100 cannot be erected.

(b) Location. An A-frame sign must be located within a property’s setback, or within another commercially or industrially zoned business’s setback, except as provided below.

(A) If the sign is located on another commercially or industrially zoned property, the sign owner must obtain written consent from the business’s owner, or from the property’s owner if no business exists on the property. As only one A-frame sign is allowed per business or property, as relevant, this consent must also explicitly waive the owner’s right to an additional A-frame sign.

(B) For properties without setbacks, or for properties that directly abut a sidewalk, the sign cannot impede pedestrian access along the business’s frontage. A sign placed on or near a sidewalk must allow for at least five feet of unobstructed sidewalk width.

The form will include an acknowledgement by the sign’s owner of the city’s rules regarding A-frame signs, describe the precise location of the sign, and include other information necessary to ensure compliance with the city’s sign code.

(B) If an A-frame sign owner’s business license expires or is otherwise rendered invalid, the owner’s use of its A-frame sign is prohibited until a new business license is issued.

(C) A business cannot obtain more than one business license in order to have more than one A-frame sign.

(5) Other signs in commercial and industrial districts. Signs under this subsection are allowed within commercial and industrial zones. Signs allowed under this subsection are in addition to other signs permitted under this chapter.

(a) Internal sign.

(A) Location. An internal sign must be directed at visitors who have entered a given development, and not be directed to traffic passing by the development. To that end, the minimum setback for an internal sign is two times the minimum setback required in the zoning district in which the internal sign is located, or at another location that ensures the sign is only directed at visitors of a development, as determined by the City Administrator or designee. An internal sign traditionally identifies tenants or destinations within a development and directs traffic to such tenants or destinations.

(B) Area. The maximum area allowed for an internal sign is 40 square feet.

(C) Number. A development may have no more than four internal signs, and the total aggregate area for all such signs cannot exceed 40 square feet.

(b) If the city determines that a water line size greater man the required minimum in diameter is required to provide for future extension of the water system, the city will reimburse the developer the difference in cost of pipe and valves between that of the minimum diameter and the size stipulated by the city.

(6) Coordination with Street Surfacing. All underground utilities, sanitary sewers and storm drains installed in streets by the developer or by any utility company shall be constructed prior to the surfacing of the streets. Stubs for service connections for underground utilities and sanitary sewers shall be placed to a length minimizing the necessity for disturbing the street improvements when service connections are made.

(7) As-Built Submittals. A map showing all public improvements, as built, shall be filed with the city engineer upon completion of the improvements.

(8) Conditions for Refund to Developer.

(a) If required water mains or sewer facilities will without further construction other than individual laterals, directly serve properties outside the development, the city may enter into an agreement with the developer to require owners of the other benefiting properties to refund to the developer, a pro rata portion of the cost of the extension prior to allowing the benefiting property to connect thereto;

(b) Any such agreement shall contain a provision that the developer agrees to completely indemnify and hold harmless the city for any claim or injury or action arising from the city’s administration of such agreement;

(c) The right to require such a refund shall not continue for more than 10 years after the date of installation of the extension;

17.64.020 Blocks.

(1) General. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be designed with due regard for the provision of adequate building sites for the use contemplated, consideration of the need for traffic safety, convenience, access, circulation and control, and recognition of limitations and opportunities of topography.

(2) Sizes. Full street connections shall be provided at intervals consistent with the adopted transportation system plan for the identified street classification, except as modified by GMC Sections 17.50.020 and 17.50.030(2), or where prevented by topography, existing development, barriers such as railroads or freeways, or environmental constraints such as major streams and rivers.

(3) Easements:

(a) Utility lines. Easements for sewers, drainage, water mains, electric lines or other public utilities shall be dedicated wherever necessary. The easements shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width and centered on rear or side lot lines at change of direction points of easements, except for guy wire tieback easements which shall be six feet wide by 20 feet long along lot lines.

(b) Watercourses. If a tract is traversed by a watercourse such as a drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of the watercourse and adequate in width for the purpose. Streets, parkways or greenways parallel to or integrated with major watercourses may be required.

(c) Pedestrian and Bicycle Ways. Except as modified by GMC Section 17.50.030(2), in blocks over 800 feet in length, a pedestrian or bicycle way with a minimum width of 10 feet shall be provided through the middle of the block when desirable for public convenience. If unusual conditions require blocks longer than 1,200 feet, two pedestrian ways may be required. When desirable for public convenience, or when called for in the comprehensive plan, pedestrian ways may be required to connect cul-de-sacs, to pass through unusually shaped blocks, or to facilitate a linked system of pedestrian ways or greenways or bicycle ways.

(d) Greenways. When called for in the comprehensive plan, the Planning Commission may require the dedication, reservation or setting aside of greenways which will be open or accessible to the public. Except for trails or paths, such greenways will usually be left in a natural condition without improvements. Where appropriate, greenways may be combined with easements for utilities or watercourses.

17.64.030 Building sites.

(1) Size and Shape. Lot size, width, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. The width of a lot shall be at least 50 feet except that corner lots shall have a width of at least 60 feet to permit appropriate building setback from both streets. Minimum lot depth in a residential district shall be 60 feet. In the case of irregular lots, the width shall be measured along the front building line. Except in a PUD development, in no case shall a lot area be less than the zoning district required. The Planning Commission may, when such a minimum in the case of multi-family dwelling subdivision development would result in a conflict with the minimum area requirements of the zoning ordinance, require larger minimum area requirement so as to conform to the zoning ordinance. These minimum standards shall apply with the following exceptions:

(a) Where property is zoned and planned for commercial or industrial use, other widths and areas may be permitted at the discretion of the Planning Commission. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.

(2) Frontage. A lot shall have minimum frontage of 20 feet on a street other than an alley.

(3) Through Lots and Parcels. Through lots and parcels shall be avoided except where they are essential to provide separation of residential development from major traffic arteries or adjacent nonresidential activities or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement at least 10 feet wide, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of building sites abutting such a traffic artery or other incompatible use.

(4) Lot and Parcel Side Lines. The lines of lots and parcels as far as is practicable, shall run at right angles to the street upon which they face, except that on curved streets they shall be radial to the curve.

17.68.040 Conditions.

(1) City Council may require conditions. When necessary to properly relate new developments to existing or anticipated conditions in the vicinity or to make possible a higher quality of development than would otherwise be possible, the City Council may determine that a zone change will be accompanied by the acceptance or accomplishment of certain specified conditions. Conditions and requirements invoked pursuant to a zoning map amendment shall thereafter apply to the property so zoned.

(2) Acceptance of conditions. Such conditions shall be designed to further the objectives of the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance codified in this title and shall clearly set forth, in written form or upon drawings, all restrictions and requirements which will be applicable to the property rezoned. Where a zone change is made subject to such conditions, it shall become effective upon written acceptance and filing of the applicable terms and conditions by the property owner and by any other person intending to have an ownership interest in or to develop the property. The signed acceptance of conditions shall be filed with the City Recorder and a certified copy shall also be filed in the county deed records at the expense of the petitioner.

(3) Type of conditions. Conditions may include special measures designed to limit use or density, screen or separate buildings or portions of the site from adjoining property; limit access from important thoroughfares or through residential areas; provide additional right-of-way for an abutting street, preserve or provide public access to greenspace, floodplains, or river frontage; improve bicycle or pedestrian safety and connectivity; or improve transit capacity and efficiency.

(4) No variance of ordinance standards. In connection with the adoption of a zoning amendment, ordinance standards may be varied only when the Planning Commission finds that the development proposed and covered by specific limiting conditions will provide benefits and safeguards equal to or better than those possible under a strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance. In no case shall a use not specifically permitted within the zoning district be allowed under this section and Section 17.68.050. When circumstances as described in GMC Section 17.72.020 (circumstances for granting) exist, the regular variance procedures shall be followed.

(5) Building permit conditions. In addition to conditions as described above in this section, the Council may also provide that a zoning amendment will become effective upon satisfactory performance by the applicant of certain conditions or actions, such as a bona fide application for a building permit within a specified period of time.

17.68.050 Evidence supplied by applicant.

The applicant seeking a zoning map change pursuant to the provisions of GMC Section 17.68.010 must show by a preponderance of the evidence all of the following, unless otherwise provided for in this title:

(1) Granting the request fulfills a public need; the greater departure from present development policies or land use patterns, the greater the burden of the applicant.

(2) The public need is best carried out by granting the petition for the proposed action, and that need is best served by granting the petition at this time.

(3) The proposed action is consistent with the comprehensive plan and Metro’s Functional Plan (Metro Code 3.07), and the Transportation Planning Rule (OAR 660-012-0060).

(4) Proof of significant change in a neighborhood or community or a mistake in the planning or zoning for the property under consideration, when relevant.

(5) The property and affected area is presently provided with, or concurrent with development can be provided with, adequate public facilities, including, but not limited to, the planned function, capacity, and performance standards of the transportation system as adopted in the transportation system plan.

(6) The transportation system is capable of safely supporting the uses allowed by the proposed designation in addition to the existing and planned uses in the area, consistent with the Transportation Planning Rule (OAR 660-012-0060). Requirements of the State Transportation Planning Rule shall apply to those land use actions that significantly affect the transportation system, as defined by OAR 660-012-0060.

17.70.050 History: Ord. 1131 §2, 1990; Repealed by Ord. 1323 §1, 2002.


17.70.010 Authorization to grant or deny.

(1) Approval Criteria. A conditional use may be approved, pursuant to GMC Division VII (administrative procedures), if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed use:

(a) Is listed as a conditional use in the underlying zoning district or is authorized pursuant to GMC Chapter 17.74 (authorization of similar uses);

(b) Is suitable for the proposed site, considering size, shape, location, topography, existence of improvements and natural features;

(c) Is timely, considering the adequacy of transportation systems, public facilities and services existing or planned for the area affected by the use;

(d) The location, size, and functional characteristics of the proposal are such that it can be made reasonably compatible with and have a minimal impact on livability and appropriate development of properties in the area and neighborhoods surrounding the subject site.

(e) Satisfies the policies of the comprehensive plan that apply to the proposed use.

(2) Conditions of Approval. In addition to the specific requirements of this title, including those set forth in GMC Chapter 17.62 (special uses), and the comprehensive plan, approval of a conditional use may be granted subject to additional conditions that are found necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding area or the city as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) Limiting the hours, days, place and manner of operation;

(b) Requiring design features that minimize environmental impacts such as noise, vibration, smoke, dust, fumes and glare;

(c) Requiring increased setbacks, lot area, lot depth and lot width;

(d) Limiting building height, size, lot coverage and location on the site;

(e) Designating the size, number, location and design of vehicle access points;

(f) Requiring street right-of-way to be dedicated and streets to be improved;

(g) Requiring landscaping, screening, drainage and surfacing of parking and loading areas;

(h) Limiting the number, size, location, height and lighting of signs;

(i) Regulating the location and intensity of outdoor lighting;

(j) Requiring a sight-obscuring fence or hedge to screen the conditional use from adjacent to or nearby property;

(k) Construction of off-site transportation improvements to mitigate impacts resulting from development that relate to capacity deficiencies and public safety; and

(l) Upgrade or construct public facilities to city standards.

(3) Nonconforming Uses. When a nonconforming use is classified in this title as a conditional use, any change in the use, lot area or a structure associated with the use, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter, except:

(a) Normal maintenance, as defined in GMC Section 17.70.010(4), shall be permitted without conditional use review;

(b) Nonconforming single family dwellings may be expanded, remodeled, altered or replaced where there is no increase in the number of dwelling units, and where substantial construction of any replacement occurs within one year of destruction, without conditional use review;

(c) Uses operating between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., prior to the date uses operating between those hours were classified as conditional uses, shall be permitted without conditional use review, unless:

(i) There is a change in the underlying use of the given property. For instance, a restaurant that operated between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., prior to the date uses operating between those hours were classified as conditional uses, could continue to operate between those hours after said date, without conditional use review. Furthermore, a restaurant that operated between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. prior to said date could be operated as a different restaurant after said date and continue to operate between those hours, without conditional use review. However, a restaurant that operated between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. prior to said date could not continue to operate between those hours as a tavern, convenience store, etc., unless conditional use approval was sought and received. The city believes this approach to be rationally related to the city’s desire to ensure that any such change in the underlying use of a given property can be made compatible with and have a minimal impact upon surrounding neighborhoods if continued late night operation is desired.

(4) Modifications. With the exception of normal maintenance and the expansion, remodeling, alteration or replacement of a single-family dwelling, modification of an existing conditional use shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. Normal maintenance of structures and premises that are part of a conditional use shall be permitted provided there are no significant use or structural alterations. Normal maintenance may include painting, roofing, siding, interior remodeling, electrical work, plumbing work, re-paving of access roads and parking/loading areas, replacement of landscaping elements or other similar tasks. Normal maintenance does not include increasing the number of dwelling units, constructing new structures or constructing additions to existing structures except to the extent that an addition is necessary to render a structure accessible to the disabled. Normal maintenance performed shall be consistent with previous approvals of the conditional use. Expansion, remodeling, alteration or replacement of a single-family dwelling shall not qualify for the exception under this subsection if the modification would result in an increase in the number of dwelling units.

(5) Under GMC Sections 17.16.040, 17.18.040 and 17.20.040, a use shall be deemed operating if the use is open for operation to serve the general public, or open for operation to serve a private membership, without limitation.

17.76.020 Nonconforming uses and nonconforming developments.

(1) Continuance of a Nonconforming Use or a Nonconforming Development: Alteration of a Nonconforming Development. Except as provided herein, a nonconforming use may be continued but may not be altered or extended. The extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a development which was arranged or designed for the nonconforming use at the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this title is not an enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming development which conforms with respect to use may be altered or extended provided the alteration or extension conforms to the standards of this title.

(2) Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of one (1) year, further use of the property shall conform to this title.

(3) Maintenance. Normal maintenance of structures and premises that are part of a nonconforming use shall be permitted provided there are no significant use or structural alterations. Normal maintenance may include painting, roofing, siding, interior remodeling, electrical work, plumbing work, re-paving of access roads and parking/loading areas, replacement of landscaping elements or other similar tasks. Normal maintenance does not include increasing the number of dwelling units, constructing new structures or constructing additions to existing structures except to the extent that an addition is necessary to render a structure accessible to the disabled.

(4) Alterations Required by Law. Alteration of a nonconforming use shall be permitted when necessary to comply with any lawful requirement for alteration of the use or structures and premises associated with the use. Such alteration shall be subject to building, plumbing, electrical and other permit requirements in effect at the time the alteration is begun.

(5) Alterations Not Required by Law. A nonconforming use may be altered, expanded or changed to another nonconforming use pursuant to GMC Division VII (administrative procedures) and subject to the following criteria:

(a) The alteration, expansion or change of use will, after the imposition of conditions as authorized below, have no greater adverse impact on the neighborhood than the existing use.

17.76.040 Setback requirements.

The following exceptions to setback requirements may be authorized for a lot in any zoning district:

(1) Average of Adjacent Front Setbacks. If there are buildings on both abutting lots which are within one hundred feet (100’) of the intervening lot, and the buildings have front setbacks of less than the minimum for the zoning district, the front setback for the intervening lot need not exceed the average front setback of the abutting lots or ten feet (10’), whichever is greater. However, in all cases the minimum front setback requirement of the zoning district shall be maintained for a garage or carport if the garage vehicle entrance or an open side of the carport faces the front lot line.

(2) Related to Abutting Front Setbacks. If there is a building on one (1) abutting lot which is within one hundred feet (100’) of the lot, and this building has a front setback of less than the minimum for the zoning district, the front setback for the lot need not exceed the average of the front setback of the abutting lot and the minimum front setback for the zoning district, or ten feet (10’), whichever is greater. However, in all cases the minimum front setback requirement of the underlying zoning district shall be maintained for a garage or carport if the garage vehicle entrance or an open side of the carport faces the front lot line.

(3) Corner Lots with Frontage on a Private Street. Where a corner lot has frontage on a public street and also has frontage on a private street from which it does not receive vehicular access, the lot line abutting the private street shall be considered a side lot line for the purpose of determining the minimum setback requirement.

(4) Front Setbacks from Private Streets or Flag Lot Accesses. Where the front lot line of a lot in an R-5 or R-7.2 zoning district abuts a private street or the narrow deeded strip of land or easement providing access to a flag lot, the front setback may be reduced to ten feet (10’). However, if a garage vehicle entrance or an open side of a carport faces the front lot line, a minimum setback of twenty feet (20’) shall be maintained between the garage or carport and the interior edge of the private street or flag lot access drive.

(5) Flag Lots. For the purpose of determining the minimum setback requirements for a flag lot, the designation of front, rear and side property lines may be modified to allow flexibility in the placement of structures when one or both of the following conditions apply:

(a) It is not possible to extend the narrow deeded strip of land or easement providing access to the flag lot to serve additional lots due to physical conditions such as topography or existing development; or

(b) It is not necessary to extend the narrow deeded strip of land or easement providing access to the flag lot to serve additional lots because the subject property and adjacent property are fully developed or have adequate alternative access from existing streets.

(6) Fences and walls. There shall be no minimum setback requirements for fences and walls. Compliance with GMC Chapter 17.54 (clear vision) shall be required.

(7) Through lots. In the case of a through lot, either of the lot lines separating the lot from a street other than an alley may be designated by the property owner as the front lot line with the other such lot line designated as a rear lot line. However, in a residential zoning district, a minimum setback of twenty feet (20’) shall be maintained between a garage vehicle entrance or an open side of a carport and a street.

(b) A site visit by the City Police Chief demonstrates that the violation has been eliminated; or

(c) The City Administrator, in conjunction with the City Police Chief, determines that there are no public health and safety issues resulting from the violation and there are extenuating circumstances that justify providing the violator additional time, in excess of 30 business days from the date of the violation letter, to abate the violation. The amount of additional time to be provided to the violator shall be determined in the City Administrator’s sole discretion.

(5) When there is a violation of conditions attached to any land use permit approved pursuant to this title, the City Administrator may initiate a public hearing before the Planning Commission for revocation of the land use approval, pursuant to GMC Section 17.94.100.
