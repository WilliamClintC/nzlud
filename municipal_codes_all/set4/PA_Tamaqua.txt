suspend an action to enforce an order to correct until the matter is resolved. An action
relating to an unsafe building, structure, or equipment may not be stayed.
Hearings and decisions.
The Board shall decide an appeal, variance request, or request for extension of time by

Board, a quorum shall be required. A quorum shall constitute not less than a majority of
all the members of the Board. If the Board appoints a hearing officer from its own
membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf, the parties may waive further action by
the Board as provided above.
If the owner or owner's agent requests a hearing, the Board shall schedule a hearing and
notify the owner or owner's agent and building Code Enforcement Official of the date,
time and place of the hearing.
At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney.
When making its final decision, the Board may deny the request in whole or in part, grant
the request in whole or in part, or grant the request upon certain conditions being
satisfied.
The Board shall give the reasons for its decision or reasons in support of its findings, in
writing, to all parties (applicant, owner, representative, or Code Enforcement Official)
concerned who are entitled to receive same by law. If the Board does not make a
decision or notify the applicant within 45 days after the hearing or continued hearing, it
shall be deemed that such Board had decided in favor of the applicant seeking relief.

findings to the applicant or owner by registered mail on the day following its date. To all
other persons who have filed their name and address with the Board prior to the hearing,

If an Assistant Chief of the Fire Department candidate is appointed and does not meet the
minimum requirements at the time of the appointment, he or she will be given six months to
complete the applicable requirements. If the applicable requirements are not met, the Assistant
Chief of the Fire Department will be removed and the fire company will have the opportunity to
present another name to the Borough that meets the stated qualifications. The newly appointed
Assistant Chief of the Fire Department will go to the bottom of the seniority rotation.
Since the Borough has no control over the internal protocols, procedures, or bylaws of each
company, in the event that a company cannot present an Assistant Chief of the Fire Department
candidate with the qualifications, that company's unsuccessful designee may carry the title of
Company Chief. Under this classification, the Company Chief title will be equivalent to a Captain
rank within the chain of command of the department. The Company Chief is not entitled to any
compensation or recognition as an Assistant Chief of the Fire Department, and will not be
considered in any chain of command or seniority rotation. If at such time the Company Chief
obtains Assistant Chief of the Fire Department qualifications, they may be then presented to the
Council for appointment and, if successfully appointed, will enter at the bottom of the seniority
rotation as outlined above.
The Assistant Chiefs of the Fire Department shall continue their fire service training each year by
successfully completing no less than eight hours of fire service training from an accredited agency.
All required course documentation must be submitted to the Borough at the end of each year.
Any Assistant Chief of the Fire Department can be removed from office at any time by the
Borough if they feel there is legitimate just cause to do so or they do not meet the required
continuing education stipulation.

§ 148-2. Authority.
This chapter is adopted and enacted pursuant to the authority granted to the Borough of Tamaqua by
all relevant state and federal laws, including, but not limited to, the following:
The general authority granted by the Constitution of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Borough
Code to make and adopt all such ordinances, bylaws, rules, and regulations as may be deemed
expedient or necessary for the proper management, care, and control of the Borough of Tamaqua
and its finances and the maintenance of the health, safety, peace, good government, and welfare
of the Borough of Tamaqua;
The Constitution of Pennsylvania, Art. 1, Section 2, which provides that all power is inherent in the
people, and that all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace,
safety, and happiness;
The Constitution of Pennsylvania, Art. 1, Section 27, which guarantees a clean and safe
environment for the people of Pennsylvania; and
Pennsylvania Statutes, Title 53, Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Corporations, Section 46202,[1]
which authorizes the Borough of Tamaqua to enact ordinances necessary for the proper
management, care, and control of the Borough and its finances and the maintenance of peace,
good government, safety, health and welfare of the Borough and its citizens, trade, commerce,
and manufacturers.
Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1202.
§ 148-3. Findings and general purpose.
The Tamaqua Borough Council recognizes that:
A corporation is a legal fiction created by the express permission of the people of the Borough of
Tamaqua as citizens of this state;
A corporation is a limited liability entity, and its officers, directors, and investors are shielded from
liability for harms caused by the corporation;
If a corporation causes harms to the residents of the Borough of Tamaqua, the corporation's
structure as an incorporated entity, and the limited liability of the individuals that control the
corporation, make it more difficult to obtain redress and compensation from a corporation than
from a natural person or unincorporated association or partnership;
Protection of the natural environment and the residents of this Borough is a fundamental obligation
of the Tamaqua Borough Council in their role as elected representatives of the residents of the
Borough of Tamaqua; and
This Borough has experienced serious environmental degradation from projects commenced by
corporations. This Borough finds that prior degradation has diminished the quality of life of the
residents of the Borough, and that this chapter protects that quality of life by requiring a
corporation to select the most environmentally sound alternative for particular projects.
§ 148-4. Specific purpose.
The specific purpose of this chapter is to require all corporations planning to undertake certain
activities within the Borough of Tamaqua to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to
examine the environmental and community impacts resulting from major corporate projects, to analyze

alternatives to the proposed projects, and to select the most environmentally sound alternative for
those projects.
§ 148-5. Statement of law.
Corporations planning significant corporate actions within the Borough of Tamaqua shall prepare a
detailed statement known as an environmental impact statement (EIS) for all significant corporate
actions within the Borough. By law, corporations shall be required under this chapter to select the most
environmentally sound alternative for any project undertaken by the corporation.
§ 148-6. Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to words used within this chapter:
ALTERNATIVES
Alternatives to the proposed significant corporate action which fully examine a range of all
possible approaches to a particular project, including the total abandonment of the project. A
corporation shall not artificially narrow the goal of the project to narrow the range of alternatives
considered for the project. The consideration of alternatives must rigorously explore and
objectively evaluate all alternatives to the project.
CONNECTED ACTIONS
Actions which are closely related and which depend on other actions which are taken previously or
simultaneously, or are interdependent parts of a larger action.
CORPORATION
Any corporation organized under the laws of any state of the United States or any country. The
term "corporation" shall include all entities that possess limited liability characteristics, including
limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, business trusts, and limited liability corporations
organized under the laws of any state or the United States or any country. This term shall not
include general partnerships, except general partnerships in which corporations are partners.
MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND ALTERNATIVE
The alternative to the proposed corporate action that has the least impact on the natural
environment and communities within the Borough of Tamaqua, of the range of alternatives
examined to the proposed significant corporate action.
SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE ACTION
Any action entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, controlled, or approved by a
corporation which has more than a minor impact within the Borough. The aggregate impact of
multiple actions, each having minor impacts within the Borough, shall be considered a significant
corporate action if the multiple actions are connected actions or similar actions and have
cumulative impacts that are greater than minor impacts.
§ 148-7. The environmental impact statement.
The environmental impact statement shall include a detailed explanation and analysis of the following:
The environmental impact of the proposed action;
Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented;
Alternatives to the proposed action;

environmental impact statement:
Any corporate activity which requires a permit or other form of approval from the Borough Council;
Any corporate activity which will cause more than a minor impact to the Borough's natural
environment or its communities;
Any corporate activity similar to activities in other localities that have previously caused more than
a minor impact to the natural environment or communities.

Scoping phase. The corporation shall engage in a scoping process, through which the corporation
shall invite the participation of state and local agencies, interested persons within the community,
community nonprofit organizations, and other interested entities to determine the scope of the
project and the significant issues to be analyzed in depth within the statement. The scoping phase
shall be performed after the publication of a scoping notice in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Borough in which the project is being pursued. The scoping notice shall invite interested
persons to participate in the scoping process and will announce at least one public meeting to be
held at the Borough building after 6:00 p.m. on a non-holiday weekday.
Production of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The corporation shall prepare and
release a DEIS following the completion of the scoping phase. Notice of the availability of the
DEIS shall be advertised in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the affected Borough.
The DEIS shall contain several sections, including the following:
Cover sheet identifying the corporation, a brief description of the proposed corporate activity,
and contact information for the corporation;
A description of the corporation, including a listing of its board of directors and officers, and
including, as an attachment, a copy of the corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws;

environmentally sound alternative.

Large fireworks to be used solely by professional pyrotechnicians and designed primarily to
produce visible or audible effects by combustion, deflagration or detonation. The term includes,
but is not limited to:
Salutes that contain more than two grains or 130 milligrams of explosive materials;
Aerial shells containing more than 60 grams of pyrotechnic compositions; and
Other display pieces that exceed the limits of explosive materials for classification as
consumer fireworks and are classified as fireworks UN0333, UN0334 or UN0335 under 49
CFR 172.101 (relating to purpose and use of hazardous materials table).
ILLEGAL EXPLOSIVES
(For information purposes only) Illegal explosives associated with the fireworks season are
inherently dangerous because of their composition and unpredictability. Homemade explosives
can poses a particular risk for injury because the people making them often lack knowledge and
experience in manufacturing fireworks. Most law enforcement agencies consider devices such an
M-80s, M-100s, quarter stick, cherry bombs, silver salutes, etc., to be illegal because they exceed
the Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) limits for consumer fireworks, in addition to

Chapter 164. Floodplain Management
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Borough Council of the Borough of Tamaqua 11-18-2014 by Ord. No. 675.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
Article I. General Provisions
§ 164-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978,[1] delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of Tamaqua Borough does hereby order as follows.
8/17/2020 Borough of Tamaqua, PA Ecode360

Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 164-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents, by
preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 164-3. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough of Tamaqua unless
a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 164-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 164-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of Tamaqua or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and
report such fact to the Tamaqua Borough Council for whatever action it considers necessary.
The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain all records associated with the requirements of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection
and enforcement.

Article III. Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 164-16. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
Any areas of the Borough of Tamaqua classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated November 19, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study.
Any Community Identified Flood Hazard Areas.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments are
hereby adopted by the Borough of Tamaqua and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 164-17. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any
AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation
shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu of the above, the Borough of Tamaqua may
require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers
or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Borough of Tamaqua.

Community Identified Flood Hazard Areas shall be those areas where the Borough of Tamaqua
has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood
Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
§ 164-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council of Tamaqua Borough where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood
hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 164-21B for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 164-19. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Borough of Tamaqua and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Tamaqua Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 164-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article IV. Technical Provisions
§ 164-21. General.
Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the Borough of Tamaqua, and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development that
causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in
Zones A1-A30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including, but not
limited to, installing culverts and bridges) the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):

nonprofit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other.
The HARC may require that an applicant furnish additional information relevant to its
determination of unreasonable economic hardship.
Should the HARC determine that the owner's present return is not reasonable, it must consider
whether there are other uses currently allowed that would provide a reasonable return and
whether such a return could be obtained through investment in the property for rehabilitation
purposes. The HARC may choose to recommend to the Tamaqua Borough Council that special
economic incentives be developed to assist the owner of the resource in maintaining it and
obtaining a suitable economic return or achieving a reasonable beneficial use.
The HARC may seek the assistance of appropriate local, statewide or national preservation
organizations in developing solutions which would relieve the owner's economic hardship. If the
HARC chooses to explore such options, the HARC may delay issuing a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition on the basis of economic hardship for a period of 90 days in
addition to time periods otherwise applicable.
Should the applicant satisfy the HARC that he will suffer an unreasonable economic hardship if a
certificate of appropriateness is not approved, and should the HARC be unable to develop with the
Borough of Tamaqua or appropriate local, statewide and national preservation organization a
solution which can relieve the owner's economic hardship, the HARC must recommend a
certificate of appropriateness for demolition.

issues a certificate indicating that there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against real property and no costs incurred by the municipality for the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the real property, the insuring agent shall pay the claim of
the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the
insuring agent equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the
building restructure, the following procedures must be followed:
The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the designated officer of the
municipality in the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000 of a claim and for each fraction of that
amount of a claim, this section to be applied such that if the claim is $15,000 or less, the amount
transferred to the municipality shall be $2,000; or
If, at the time of a loss report agreed to between the named insured and the insuring agent, the
named insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure, the insuring agent shall transfer to the municipality from
the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges
insuring the building or other structure.

removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, and the designated officer shall
return the amount of the funds transferred to the municipality in excess of the estimate to the
named insured, if the municipality has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or
other structure.
Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the municipality shall do the following:
The designated officer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or structure
which are incurred by the municipality. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the municipality in connection with such
removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related thereto; and

proof of such completion received by the designated officer, and if the municipality has not
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named

deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the municipality
and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the
named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
The written request for the certificate to the Municipal Treasurer shall include: the tax description
of the property, the name and address of the insurance company, association or exchange and the

Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 206-1. Prohibited acts; duties of police.
For the purpose of this chapter, a person commits a violation if he loiters, lingers idly, or prowls about
in a public place, or street, or loiters in or around a public building, apartment building or place of
business, or obstructs corridors, stairways or doorways, so as to prevent free access to the buildings,
at a time, or in a manner not usual for law abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm
for the public safety or convenience of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances
which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor
refuses to identify himself, or explain his purpose for being in or about a public place, or in one of the
areas described hereinbefore, or refuses to move on without reasonable explanation upon request of a
police officer, or takes flight upon appearance of a police officer, or manifestly endeavors to conceal
himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a police
officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this chapter, afford the actor an opportunity to
dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him to identify himself and explain
his presence and conduct or by affording him the opportunity to move on. No person shall be convicted
of an offense under this chapter if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it
appears at trial that the explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by the police officer at
the time, would have dispelled the alarm.
§ 206-2. Violations and penalties.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Any person who violates or permits a violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction in a summary
proceeding under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be guilty of a summary offense and
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, plus court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred by the Borough in the enforcement proceedings. Upon judgment against any person by
summary conviction, or by proceedings by summons on default of the payment of the fine or penalty
imposed and the costs, the defendant may be sentenced and committed to the Schuylkill County
correctional facility for a period not exceeding 30 days. Each day that such violation exists shall
constitute a separate offense, and each section of this chapter that is violated shall also constitute a
separate offense.

the Jamesway Plaza Driveway and the western Borough line or on State Route 309 between the

contribute to the deterioration of property values and general disorder in a community. These problems
degrade the physical appearance of the Borough, which reduces business and tax revenue, inhibiting
economic development. The quality of life and community pride of the citizens of Tamaqua are
negatively impacted by the occurrences and existence of these activities. Recognizing these are
community problems, the purpose of this article is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of
the Borough by helping to create a clean environment for the citizens of Tamaqua.

§ 260-33. Measuring volume of sewage.
Whenever the entire water supply of any commercial establishment, industrial establishment or
institutional establishment discharging sewage into the sewers and sewer system shall be
supplied by the water system, the volume of water furnished, as determined from meter readings
of the water system, shall be used as the volume of water consumed in computing sewer rentals
or charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this article.
Whenever any commercial establishment, industrial establishment or institutional establishment
discharging sewage into the sewers and sewer system shall have a source or sources of water
supply in addition to or other than the water system, a meter shall be installed on such additional
or other source or sources of water supply. The total volume of water consumed, as determined
from the meter readings of the water system and the meter readings of the meter or meters on
such additional source or sources of water supply or the meter readings of the meter or meters on
such other source or sources of water supply, as appropriate, shall be used as the volume of
water consumed in computing sewer rentals or charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as
provided in this article.
Whenever any commercial establishment, industrial establishment of institutional establishment
shall have installed, as required by this Borough, or as may be elected at the option of any
commercial establishment, industrial establishment or institutional establishment, a meter or
meters for measuring the volume of sewage discharged into the sewers and sewer system, sewer
rentals or charges shall be based upon the actual metered volume of sewage so being discharged
into the sewers and sewer system. Such sewer rentals or charges shall be computed at the
applicable rates set forth in § 260-29 hereof.
[Amended 5-6-1975 by Ord. No. 347]
Exclusion from the sewer system of noncontaminated wastewaters and waters used for cooling
purposes may be required by this Borough or such exclusion may be optional with the owner if not
required by this Borough. When such waters are excluded, the volume of water or other measure
to be used for computation of sewer rentals or charges shall be computed in one of the following
methods:
By installing a meter or other measuring device on the connection to the sewer system. The
readings from such meter or other measuring device shall be used as the measure of
discharge of sewage in computing sewer rentals or charges in accordance with the applicable
rates set forth in § 260-29 hereof.

shall be deducted from the total water meter readings and the remainder shall be the volume
of water to be used in computing sewer rentals or charges in accordance with the applicable
rates set forth in § 260-29 hereof.
If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Borough, to install a meter or other measuring device
to determine continuously the volume of water not discharged into the sewer system, this
Borough may determine, in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the
percentage of metered water which is being discharged into the sewer system. The volume of
water to be used in computing sewer rentals or charges in accordance with the applicable
rates set forth in § 260-29 hereof shall be the percentage so determined of the volume of
water measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such estimated percentage
shall be submitted to this Borough, after notice of such estimate. The decision of this Borough
with respect to the matter shall be final for the then current calendar year.
The furnishing and installation of meters or other measuring devices which shall not be owned as
a part of the water system, but which shall be required or permitted under provisions of this article,
shall be the sole responsibility of the owner. The installation or use of such meters or other
measuring devices at all times shall be subject to the approval of this Borough and may be tested
and inspected by this Borough whenever necessary. The owner shall be responsible for the
maintenance, safekeeping and repair of any such meter, whether such repairs shall be made
necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes.
§ 260-34. Industrial waste regulations.
When directed by the Borough, owners of industrial establishments shall install, pay for, and

3.5 cents per 1,000 gallons of actual water consumption, arrived at on the basis of the calculations
set forth in Schedule A.[1]
Editor's Note: Schedule A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
3.1 cents per pound of five-day BOD, arrived at on the basis of the calculations set forth in
Schedule A.
1.4 cents per pound of suspended solids, arrived at on the basis of calculations set forth in
Schedule A.
13.9 cents per pound of phosphorus, arrived at on the basis of the calculations set forth in
Schedule A.
When noncontaminated wastewaters are excluded from the sewage system, or when any other
portion of water consumption does not reach the sewage system, the industrial cost recovery
charge shall be based upon total water consumption, less water excluded, as set forth under
Subsection A. Water excluded shall be determined from meters installed and maintained by the
industrial user as required and approved by the Borough, from estimates made by the Borough, or
the industrial user may elect to measure wastewater volumes actually discharged to the sewage
system as hereinafter provided. The Borough may require the industrial user, or the industrial user
may elect to install, pay for, and maintain a meter approved by the Borough for measuring
quarterly wastewater volumes discharged to the sewer system, in which case industrial cost
recovery charges under Subsection A shall be based upon the actual volume of wastewaters so
metered.
The strength of wastewaters to be used for establishing the amount of five-day BOD, suspended
solids, and phosphorus used to determine the charges for industrial cost recovery purposes as set
forth under Subsections B, C and D shall be determined at least once annually either (a) by
suitable sampling and analysis of the wastewaters for three consecutive days during a period of
normal plant operation; or (b) from estimates made by the Borough; or (c) from known
relationships of products produced to strengths of wastewaters for those industrial users where
such factors have been established. In establishing wastewater strengths for industrial cost
recovery purposes by analysis, analysis shall be made in accordance with procedures outlined in
the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published
by the American Public Health Association, Inc. Industrial users shall furnish the Borough, upon
request, all information deemed essential by the Borough for the determination of industrial cost
recovery charges under Subsections B, C and D. The cost of obtaining such information shall be
borne by the owner of the industrial establishment.
When industrial users discharge wastewaters to the sewage system from sanitary conveniences,
the industrial cost recovery charge shall be based upon total water consumption, less the
discharge volume from sanitary conveniences, as set forth under Subsection A. The discharge
volume from sanitary conveniences shall be determined from estimates made by the Borough.
Industrial cost recovery charges set forth herein shall be effective on June 1, 1977, and in effect
until June 1, 2007. All industrial cost recovery billings shall be rendered for calendar quarterly
periods on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year an industrial user is
connected to the sewage system. Billings in arrears shall be rendered quarterly for the quarterly
periods ending on the last days of February, May, August, and November of each year beginning
September 1, 1977. Industrial cost recovery billings under Subsections A, B, C and D and/or
Subsections E, F and G, as may be applicable, shall be based upon water consumed and
wastewater strength during the quarterly period immediately preceding the quarter in which the
billing is rendered. Industrial users connected to the sewage system for only a portion of the
calendar quarter shall pay a pro rata industrial cost recovery charge for the period of time actually
connected during the quarter. All industrial cost recovery billings shall be due and payable upon
presentation and, if not paid within 15 days from the date of billing, a penalty of 5% shall be
added. Payments mailed and postmarked on or before such 15th day shall be deemed to be

business day not a legal holiday shall be deemed to be payments within the period allowed for
payment without penalty.
§ 260-48. Access to sewage system.
Such industrial users shall be subject to the following:
The Borough or its duly authorized representatives shall, at all reasonable times, be permitted to enter
upon any and all properties for the purpose of inspecting, observing, and measuring process
wastewaters discharged to the sewage system.
§ 260-49. Additional regulations.
The industrial cost recovery system shall adhere to the following:
Industrial users are excluded from participation in industrial cost recovery if they discharge
primarily nonprocessed segregated domestic wastes, or primarily wastes from sanitary
conveniences, as determined by the Borough.
In accordance with Section 6.01 of the First Supplemental Agreement of Lease dated May 1,
1975, between the Tamaqua Borough Authority and the Borough of Tamaqua, the Borough agrees
to transmit any funds collected under this article to the Authority quarterly.
If the sewage system is upgraded or expanded, the basis of payment set forth in § 260-47A, B, C
and D will be adjusted accordingly.
In the event that an industrial user discharging process wastewaters to the sewer system or
anyone else affected by the industrial cost recovery system disagrees with the application of such
system or estimates made by the Borough of the quantities of process wastewaters discharged,
such person shall be entitled to a hearing. The industrial user and the Borough will, by mutual
agreement, with the assistance of the Borough's engineer, determine the correct quantities of
industrial process wastewater.

and state laws and their corresponding regulations, and by the inherent right of the citizens of the
Borough of Tamaqua to self-government, including, without limitation, the following:
The Declaration of Independence, which declares that people are born with "certain unalienable
rights" and that governments are instituted among people to secure those rights;

Municipal waste regulations, 25 Pa. Code §§ 271.1 et seq.; and
Land application of sewage sludge, 40 CFR Part 503.
§ 260-57. Findings and purpose.
In support of enactment of this article, the Borough Council of Tamaqua Borough finds and declares
that:
The land application of sewage sludge in Tamaqua Borough poses a significant threat to the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and environment of Tamaqua Borough.
In April 2002, the Inspector General of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which
oversees state sewage sludge regulations, issued a report in which it concluded, "EPA cannot
assure the public that current land application [of sewage sludge] practices are protective of
human health and the environment." Among the Inspector General's concerns were the following:
"failure to properly manage sludge may have adverse effects on human health and the
environment"; "EPA does not have an effective program of ensuring compliance with land
application requirements"; and state officials have criticized the lack of EPA oversight, staffing, and
commitment toward ensuring the safety of land applied sludge.
In 1994, eleven-year-old Tony Behun from Rush Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, died
from a staph infection shortly after being exposed to sewage sludge. The following year,
seventeen-year-old Daniel Pennock from Reading, Pennsylvania, died from a staph infection
shortly after being exposed to sewage sludge. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
recognizes staph as a potential pathogenic component of sewage sludge.
In spite of these risks, Tamaqua Borough has been rendered powerless by the state and federal
government to prohibit the land application of sewage sludge by persons that comply with all
applicable laws and regulations.
In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Tamaqua Borough, the soil,
groundwater, and surface water, the environment and its flora and fauna, and the practice of
sustainable agriculture, the Borough finds it necessary to ban corporations and other limited
liability entities from engaging in the land application of sewage sludge. It is recognized that a
small number of waste management corporations control the vast majority of sludge hauling and
land application, and that corporate concentration enables those corporations to define waste
management practices at the state level to the detriment of municipal communities. It is also
recognized that limited liability shields prevent financial recovery (and accountability) for damages
caused by business entities because limited liability insulates the persons managing the
corporation from harms caused by their decisions. Finally, the Borough recognizes that
corporations wielding government-conferred constitutional powers against the municipal
government renders the Borough Council unable to guarantee to its citizens a republican form of
government in the Borough.
In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Tamaqua Borough, the soil,
groundwater, and surface water, the environment and its flora and fauna, and the practice of
sustainable agriculture, it is necessary to test each load of sewage sludge to be applied by
persons before it is land applied within the Borough to determine if the level of pollutants,
pathogens, or vector attractants exceeds the levels allowed under applicable laws and regulations.
DEP does not possess sufficient funding or personnel to ensure that persons land applying
sewage sludge in Tamaqua Borough are doing so in compliance with state laws and regulations,
so Tamaqua Borough must have the option of enforcing those laws and regulations itself.
Tamaqua Borough's cost of testing sewage sludge prior to land application shall be borne by those
persons land applying sewage sludge in the Borough.

Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1202(5).
The Borough Code, Chapter 12, § 1202(20)(i)(A), which establishes the authority of Borough
governments in the commonwealth to adopt ordinances to prohibit, within the Borough, "the
carrying on of any manufacture, art, trade, or business which may be noxious or offensive . . . to . .
. the inhabitants."
The Borough Code, Chapter 12, § 1203, which establishes the general power of Borough
governments in the commonwealth to make and adopt ordinances that "may be expedient or
necessary for the proper management, care and control of the borough and its finances and the
maintenance of peace, good government, safety and welfare of the borough and its trade,
commerce and manufactures."
§ 273-14. Findings and purpose.
The general purpose of this article is to recognize that corporations engaged in certain types of waste
storage, "beneficial use" and/or waste disposal within the Borough constitute a threat to the health,
safety, welfare, and rights of the residents of Tamaqua Borough due to the limited liability of those
corporations, which may prevent full recovery for damages in the event of injuries caused to Borough
residents. That limited liability privilege shields and protects the individuals operating the corporation,
and thus serves to thwart any deterrent effect from lawsuits brought to remedy injuries caused by
those persons using the corporation to engage in waste disposal. The Borough of Tamaqua declares
that persons using corporations to store or dump dredged material, coal ash, sewage sludge,
construction and demolition (C&D) waste, radioactive material, and other waste deemed by the
Borough to be hazardous, toxic, or dangerous, place the residents of the Borough at increasing risk,
due to the harmful and dangerous composition of those wastes. The Borough of Tamaqua also
declares that corporations, engaging in waste disposal in any neighboring municipality, that causes
harm to residents of the Borough of Tamaqua, shall be held strictly liable for the migration of toxic and
hazardous contaminants across municipal borders. The Borough of Tamaqua also declares that waste
management, "beneficial use" of waste, waste disposal and mine "reclamation" corporations
increasingly determine waste policy in the commonwealth and that the Borough must take affirmative
steps to subordinate the powers of those corporations to the will of the majority within the Borough of
Tamaqua.
§ 273-15. Interpretation.
Anyone interpreting, implementing, or applying this article shall give priority to the findings and
purposes stated in § 273-14 over such accounting and business terms characterized as "economy,"
"efficiency" and "scheduling factors."
§ 273-16. Statements of law.
It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or other entity to use a corporation or syndicate to
engage in the storage, "beneficial use," land application, or disposal of hazardous waste, coal ash,
residual waste or materials derived from residual waste, dredged material, or PCB-containing
waste, as those terms are defined within Title 25, Chapter 271 et seq., and Chapter 287 et seq. of
the Pennsylvania Code, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,[1] and the provisions of this article, within
the Borough of Tamaqua. It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or other entity to use a

TAX YEAR
The period from January 1 to December 31.
TAXING AUTHORITY
The Borough of Tamaqua.
TCC
The tax collection committee established to govern and oversee the collection of earned income
tax within the TCD under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
TCD
Any tax collection district to which the taxing authority or any part of the taxing authority is
assigned under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 6924.101 et seq.
§ 305-3. Imposition of tax.
General purpose resident tax. The taxing authority hereby imposes a tax for general revenue
purposes at the rate of 0.5% on earned income and net profits of individual residents of the taxing
authority.
Ongoing tax. The tax shall continue at the above rates during the current tax year and each year
thereafter, without annual re-enactment, until this article is repealed or the rate is changed.
Local Tax Enabling Act applicable. The tax is imposed under authority of the Local Tax Enabling
Act and all provisions thereof that relate to a tax on earned income or net profits are incorporated
into this article. Any future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that are required to be
applied to a tax on earned income or net profits will automatically become part of this article upon
the effective date of such amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this article, to
the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
Applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures. The tax shall be collected and administered
in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and regulations, policies and procedures
adopted by the TCC or by the Collector. This includes any regulations, policies and procedures
adopted in the future to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
§ 305-4. Individuals under age 16 exempt from tax.
This governing body finds that minors of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial
sanction, been considered as comprising separate classes for many legislative purposes; and minors
under the age of 16 are generally emancipated and subject to compulsory school attendance and child
labor laws, and therefore have limited earned income and net profits and control of money such that
enforcement of reporting and collection of the tax hereunder against them would yield inconsequential
amounts and be unduly difficult, expensive and not in public interest. For these reasons, individuals
under the age of 16 years are exempt from liability for tax.
§ 305-5. Individual tax returns and payments.
Every individual receiving earned income or earning net profits in any tax year shall file tax returns and
pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 305-6. Employer withholding, remittance and tax returns.

Every employer shall register, withhold and remit tax and file tax returns in accordance with the Local
Tax Enabling Act.
§ 305-7. Tax Collector.
The tax will be collected from individuals and employers by the Collector.
§ 305-8. Interest, penalties, costs and fines.
Individuals and employers are subject to interest, penalties, costs and fines in accordance with the
Local Tax Enabling Act, including costs imposed by the Collector in accordance with the Local Tax
Enabling Act.
§ 305-9. Purpose: effect on other legislation, suites or
prosecutions.
The primary purpose of this article is to conform the earned income and net profits tax currently
imposed to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended and restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so
within the time frame required by Act 32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income or net
profits of individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read as stated in this article. Any other
prior enactment or part of any prior enactment conflicting with the provisions of this article is rescinded
insofar as the conflict exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in force immediately prior to
adoption of this article, the provisions of this article are intended as a continuation of such prior
enactment and not as a new enactment. If this article is declared invalid, any prior enactment levying a
similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this article. If any
part of this article is declared invalid, the similar part of any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall
remain in effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this article. The provisions of this article shall
not affect any act done or liability incurred, nor shall such provisions affect any suit or prosecution
pending or to be initiated to enforce any right or penalty or to punish offense under the authority of any
enactment in force prior to adoption of this article. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section,
this article shall amend and restate on the effective date any enactment levying a tax on earned
income or net profits in force immediately prior to the effective date.

a person may be employed.
§ 305-20. Exemption and refunds.
Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from all sources within the

to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for
the remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar
year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of
a person subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that
calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the
political subdivision may pursue collection under this article.
Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this subsection that employers shall
not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility
or exempting any employee from the local services tax.
Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and DCED, shall establish
procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal law
relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days
of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds
shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough
Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
§ 305-21. Duty of employers to collect.
Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those employers situated outside the
political subdivision but who engage in business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged
with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for
him within the political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the Collector.
Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her
employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the political subdivision.
A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata share of the tax for each
payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax
assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the
calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection

of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section, for purposes of this
section, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school
district and the municipality.
No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than one political
subdivision during each payroll period.
In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the tax if the
employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from
the employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee
will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the
number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The political subdivision
shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the withheld
tax money to the political subdivision if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount
withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 305-21B of this article
and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the end of each quarter
of a calendar year.
§ 305-22. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on forms to be supplied
to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not
the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be responsible for the
payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
§ 305-23. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to determine the number of
employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th
day following the end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 305-24. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or engages in any occupation
or profession within a primary place of employment within the political subdivision shall be required to
comply with this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th
day following the end of each quarter.
§ 305-25. Employment in more than one occupation or political
subdivision.

The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject
to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more than one
occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in
more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local
services tax shall be in the following order:
First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her principal office or is
principally employed;
Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works if the tax is levied by
that political subdivision;
Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposes the tax
nearest in miles to the person's home.
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring that the
taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other
political subdivisions.
§ 305-26. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of business outside of the
political subdivision but who perform services of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or
profession within the political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this article with the same
force and effect as though they were residents of the political subdivision. Further, any individual
engaged in an occupation within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event
his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the option of proceeding against either the
employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 305-27. Administration of tax.
The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political subdivision. It shall be the duty of the
Collector to accept and receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the
amount received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received.
The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this article and is
hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and
enforcement of this article, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this article, the examination and correction of any return made in compliance
with this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is
claimed or found to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall
have the right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(Municipalities may detail their appeal processes.)[1]
Editor's Note: See 53 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 8421 through 8428.
The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records of any employer in
order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the
means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30 days after the due dates
above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this
article, together with interest and penalty.
If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% on the amount of such tax
shall be calculated beginning with the due date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to
the flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax
or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be
responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]

pay a fine of not more than $600, plus court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the
Borough in the enforcement proceedings. If the penalty is not paid, the Borough shall initiate a civil
action for collection in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day a violation
exists shall constitute a separate offense, and each section of this chapter that is violated shall also
constitute a separate offense. In addition to or in lieu of enforcement under this section, the Borough
may enforce this chapter in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County.
§ 305-30. Interpretation.
Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the political subdivision to levy and
collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within the taxing power of the political
subdivision under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be held by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so imposed on other
persons or individuals as herein provided.
Except as set forth hereafter, all ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent herewith are
hereby repealed. Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal the imposition and collection of an
occupation privilege tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, for calendar year 2005 and all prior
calendar years, or of an emergency and municipal services tax, plus applicable penalties and
interest, for calendar years 2006 and 2007, as the same exist prior to this amendment.
The tax imposed by this article shall be effective on January 1, 2008, and all calendar years
thereafter unless repealed or modified by ordinance of the Borough of Tamaqua.
In all other respects, all other tax ordinances of the Borough of Tamaqua shall remain as
heretofore enacted, ordained and amended, which said ordinance as amended, is hereby reenacted
in its entirety herein.

the number of consumer units served thereby;
The schedule of meter rates for computing water rates, rents and charges as established
hereunder shall be applied to the resultant quotient; and

each consumer unit computed on the same basis as if each consumer unit were connected
separately and independently with the water system.

The Borough will be responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the service line
between the main and the curbline.
Service lines will not be installed when the service line passes over or through premises
which at the time may be the property of persons other than the owner of the premises to
be supplied, unless the owner of the premises supplied assumes the liability.
Service lines from curb to premises. The service line beyond the curb stop shall be installed
and maintained by and at the expense of the consumer. The portion of the service line
installed by the consumer shall be not less in size and quality than the service line in the
street laid by the Borough, and shall be laid not less than four feet below the surface, and
shall not be covered until the tap on the main is made and service line tested. If any defects in
workmanship are found the service shall not be turned on until such defects are remedied. All
plumbing connections should be able to withstand a pressure of at least 125 pounds per
square inch.

All bills for water service shall be due and payable when rendered. On all water bills
remaining unpaid 30 days after the service has been furnished, a penalty of 5% will be
added. Delinquency in payment of bills for 30 days after the service is furnished warrants
the Borough to disconnect the service upon seven days' notice.
Remittance in payment of bills sent by mail, on or previous to the last day of the nonpenalty
period, as evidenced by the United States Post Office mark on the envelope in
which they are received, will be accepted by the Borough as a tender of payment of the
bill within such non-penalty period.

charge and expense to the Borough, an easily accessible place in the cellar near the entrance
of service pipes to cellar, with a stop and waste cock on the inlet side of the meter and a stop
and waste cock on the outlet side of the meter; the stop and waste cock on the outlet side of
the meter will be furnished and installed at the expense of the consumer. If the Borough
decides that the meter is to be placed outside of the building, it must be placed in an
approved meter box at the expense of the consumer and must have suitable stop and waste
valves approved by the Borough.
Protection of meter. The consumer must, at all times, properly protect the meter from injury by
frost or any other cause and will be held responsible for repairs to the meter made necessary
due to their negligence. Damage due to freezing, hot water, or external cause shall be paid for
by the consumer.
Meter tests.
In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter, such meter shall be
tested, upon the request of the applicant, in conformity with the provisions of the rules
and regulations pertaining to water service utilities of the Public Utility Commission.
When meters are removed after installation, at the request of the applicant, for testing,
the following rule of the Public Utility Commission shall apply:
"If the meter so tested shall be found to be accurate within the limits herein specified, a
fee determined from the schedule indicated below, shall be paid to the utility by the
customer requiring such test; but if not so found, then the cost thereof shall be borne by
the utility furnishing the service. The amount of the fee shall be $2 for each water meter
having an outlet not exceeding one inch; for other water meters having an outlet not
exceeding two inches, the test fee shall be $5 per meter."
Rates for testing meters not included in the above classification, or which are so located
that the cost is out of proportion to the fee specified, will be furnished by the Commission.
If a meter is found to be in error at any test by more than 4%, an allowance or charge
shall be made to the customer by the utility equal to the excess or deficiency in quantity
charged the customer, figured back from the date of test through the entire period of the
current bill, unless it can be shown that the error is due to an accident or other cause, the
exact date of which can be determined, in which case it shall be figured back to such
date.
Leaks and defective plumbing. The Borough shall not be liable for any damage resulting from
leaks, broken pipes, or from any other cause, occurring to or within any house or building, or
between curb stop and meter, and it is expressly stipulated by and between the Borough and
the consumer, that no claims shall be made against the said Borough on account of the
bursting or breaking of any main or service pipe or any attachment to said water works.
Leaks or waste. All water passing through a meter shall be charged for at the regular rate,
and no allowance will be made for excessive consumption due to leaks or waste.
Use of hydrants.
All persons forbidden to open any fire hydrant or to use any water therefrom for sprinkling
streets, for building or any purpose without permission, in writing, from the Borough,
under the penalty prescribed by law, except in case of fire, and by fire companies to test
the hydrants, such tests shall be made directly under the supervision of an authorized
agent of the Borough.
The consumer will understand that fire protection charges are mainly a compensation for
"standing ready to serve" and that for said charge the use of water is not contemplated

Vacating the premises. A consumer desiring abatement of a water bill due to a vacancy shall
give notice, in writing, to the Borough requesting water service to be shut off. All vacancies
shall date from the day the required notice is received by the Borough or from the date
specified on the notice upon which water service is to be shut off, whichever is later.
Allowance shall be made for the period of vacancy in computing the bill of the consumer;
provided, however, that no abatement shall be made for a period of less than one month.
Connection or outlets between main and meter. No connection, or outlet, will be permitted on
the service pipe, or pipes, supplying any premises, between the street main and the meter. All
water used must pass through the meter.
Deposits from consumers.
Deposits may be required from all consumers in an amount equal to the estimated gross
bill for any single billing period plus one month, with a minimum of $5.
Deposits will be returned to the depositor when he has established his credit to the
satisfaction of the Borough.
The deposit will bear interest at the rate of 6% annum.
Any consumer having a deposit shall pay bills for water service as rendered, in
accordance with the rules of the Borough, and the deposit shall not be considered as
payment on the account of a bill during the time the consumer is receiving water service.
Multiple units. Where more than one consumer unit is located in one building, house or other
structure owned by one consumer, and such building, house or other structure, at the
discretion of the Borough, is served by one service connection, multiple charges per quarter
shall be imposed upon such consumer equal to the number of consumer units located in such
building, house or other structure. In the event that such building, house or other structure is
served by one meter, the multiple quarterly charge shall be computed in the following manner:
(1) the total consumption of water through such common water meter shall be divided by the
number of consumer units served thereby; (2) the schedule of meter rates as shown herein
shall be applied to the resultant quotient; and (3) the resultant pro rata rental and charge for
each consumer unit shall be multiplied by the number of such consumer units receiving water
service through such common water meter to arrive at the total bill for all such consumer units
served through the common meter; provided, however, that there shall be charged the
minimum quarterly rental and charge for each consumer unit computed on the same basis as
if each consumer unit were connected separately and independently.
Failure to receive bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not exempt any consumer from the
accruing of a penalty. The presentation of a bill to the consumer is only a matter of
accommodation and not a waiver of this rule.
Service. All contracts for water shall continue in force from month to month, but either party
may cancel contract by giving 10 days' written notice that the contract shall terminate on the
first day of the month succeeding date of notice. For service beginning during a monthly
period, the minimum charge shall be pro rated to the first day of the following month. In case
water is turned off at the curb at the end of any month, no further charge for water service will
be made until service is again requested.
Changing of rules and regulations. The Borough reserves the right to change, or amend, from
time to time, these rules and regulations and the rates for the use of water in the manner
provided by the Public Utility Law[1].
Editor's Note: See 66 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.

§ 340-4. Billing and payment.
All water bills will be made out only in the name of the property owner, whom the Water
Department, Borough of Tamaqua, will hold responsible for their payment and, in the event of a
change of ownership, the purchaser will be held for all unpaid water rents assessed to said
property.
[Amended 4-5-1977 by Ord. No. 359]
All bills for water service shall be due and payable as of the date thereof. If bills for water service
shall not be paid within 15 days after such shall become due and payable, a penalty of 5% shall
be added. Payments mailed and postmarked on or before such fifteenth day shall be deemed to
be payments within the period allowed for payment without penalty. If such 15th day shall be a
legal holiday or a Sunday, payments made on or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding
business day not a legal holiday shall be deemed to be payments within the period allowed for
payment without penalty.
A consumer whose water service remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after the same becomes
due and payable, is on the same line as a consumer whose water service is current at all times,
shall be ordered, upon seven days' notice by this Borough, to have his own separate line installed.
[Amended 4-5-1977 by Ord. No. 359]
Whenever water service to any consumer unit shall begin after the first day or shall terminate
before the last day of any billing period, the water rate, rent and charge for such period shall be
pro-rated equitably for that portion of the billing period during which service was provided.
A consumer desiring abatement of a water bill due to a vacancy shall give notice, in writing, to this
Borough requesting water service to be shut off. All vacancies shall date from the day the required
notice is received by this Borough or from the date specified on the notice upon which water
service is to be shut off, whichever is later. Allowance shall be made for the period of vacancy in
computing the bill of the consumer; provided, however, that no abatement shall be made for a
period of less than one month.
Every consumer initially shall provide this Borough with and thereafter shall keep this Borough
advised of his correct address. Failure of any person to receive bills for water rates, rents and
charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an
extension of the period of time during which such bills shall be payable without penalty.
§ 340-5. Enforcement.
Proper officers of this Borough hereby are authorized and directed to do all things and to take all legal
action necessary, including the filing of municipal claims in accordance with law, to enforce collection of
water rates, rents and charges established and imposed hereby and otherwise to carry out provisions
hereof.
§ 340-6. Rules and regulations.
This Borough, from time to time, in accordance with law, by appropriate ordinance or resolution,
may adopt such additional rules and regulations as, in the opinion of the Council of this Borough,
may be desirable, beneficial or necessary for or in connection with use and operation of the water
service facilities being operated by this Borough and which shall govern and control the
distribution and supply of water.
Any such rules and regulations shall be construed in conjunction with provisions hereof and shall
become effective upon the date fixed by this Borough upon adoption thereof.

Under no circumstances shall any person not authorized by the Borough open or close the stop
cocks or valves in any public or private line.
[Amended 3-1-1974 by Ord. No. 331]
In case two or more consumers are supplied with water from the same service pipe, a distinct and
separate stop cock and curb box will be provided for each consumer, if practical.
[Amended 3-1-1974 by Ord. No. 331]
No owner or tenant of any premises supplied with water by the Borough will be allowed to supply
other persons or families or other premises except by written permit from the Borough. Consumers
who violate this rule may have their water shut off after notice of five days, and it will be so until
the Borough is satisfied that the rules and regulations will be observed.
[Added 11-16-1982 by Ord. No. 408]
Service line approval, responsibility, maintenance and prohibition.
[Added 11-16-1982 by Ord. No. 408]
Upon the approval of the application of any domestic property owner for a supply of water the
Borough will tap the main, insert a corporation cock, carry the service pipe to the curb and
install a curb stop and service box.
The Borough will be responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the domestic service line
between the main and the curbline.
Service lines will not be installed when the service line passes over or through premises
which at the time may be the property of persons other than the owner of the premises to be
supplied, unless the owner of the premises supplied assumes the liability.
The service line beyond the curb stop shall be installed and maintained by and at the expense of
the consumer. The portion of the service line installed by the consumer shall not be less in size
and quality than the service line in the street laid by the Borough, and shall be laid not less than
four feet below the surface, and shall not be covered until the tap on the main is made and the
service line tested. If any defects in workmanship are found, the service shall not be turned on
until such defects are remedied. All plumbing connections should be able to withstand a pressure
of at least 125 pounds per square inch.
[Added 11-16-1982 by Ord. No. 408]
The service line from the curb to the premises shall be kept in good condition by the owner under
penalty of discontinuance of service by the Borough.
[Added 11-16-1982 by Ord. No. 408]
The Borough, upon written notification from the owner, shall allow the sidewalk excavation to
remain open for a period of 48 hours to allow the homeowner to replace the remainder of the
service line should they decide to do so. Along with this notification, the owner shall execute an
agreement with the Borough agreeing to indemnify, defend, and save harmless the Borough from
any liability as a result of the excavation remaining open.
[Added 11-16-1982 by Ord. No. 408]
In the event it is necessary for the Borough to remove the owner's sidewalk, and the removal is
not necessitated by a repair of the water line from the curb stop to the premises of the owner
(which would be the owner's responsibility), the Borough will backfill the sidewalk to grade and, in

CHAPTERS IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX.
ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Section 400. W-P (Woodland Preservation) Zoning District.
Section 401. Specific Intent. It is the purpose of the W-P Zoning District to discourage intensive
development in areas which present severe limitations to development because of such factors as steep slope,
shallow depth to bedrock, and stoniness, which are generally classified as having severe limitations for on-site
sewage disposal, are not proposed to be sewered, and which are not served by a road network. It is also the intent of
the W-P Zoning District to encourage the preservation of ecologically critical factors such as the headwaters of
streams and the surrounding watersheds, wetlands, wildlife habitats, and extensive wooded areas. The wooded areas
have even increased importance because they are located on steep slopes and in the watersheds surrounding the
headwaters of streams. By preserving these factors, wildlife populations within the ESP Region can be maintained,
stream quality can be protected, the adverse effects of increased stormwater run-off, erosion and sedimentation can
be minimized, and the recreation potential of the area maintained.
Section 402. Uses Permitted by Right. The following, as a principal use, their accessory uses and no
other, are permitted in the W-P Zoning District, provided that the use, type, dimensional, and all other applicable

detrimental to agriculture enterprises, to limit development which requires highways and other public
facilities in excess of those required by agricultural uses, and to maintain large contiguous agriculture
parcels.
D. To separate agricultural land use and activities from incompatible residential, commercial and industrial
development, and public facilities.
E. The regulations set forth in this section seek to achieve the protection of land for agricultural purposes
which is a legitimate zoning objective under the State Planning Statutes.

as specified in this Ordinance (See other note below).
Note: Any intensive agricultural uses not actually established and in operation prior to the date of adoption
of this ordinance must be located at least three hundred (300) feet from the boundary of any residential
zoning district.
Section 456. Family Farm Support Business
A. The Eastern Schuylkill Planning (ESP) Region recognizes the need to establish regulations pertaining to
farm-based occupations as a result of the increased need for the diversity of income for farmers to help
offset the rising cost of living. Such regulations must be developed in a manner which protects adjacent
agricultural uses from adverse effects. Since farm-based occupations in sparsely populated areas do not
typically represent a significant threat to adjacent property owners, the ESP Region has created regulations
for Family Farm Support Businesses in order to promote and preserve family farms within the
municipalities. Within the EAP Zoning District, a Family Farm Support Business is permitted as a Use by
Right, subject to the following standards:
1. For the purposes of this Ordinance, Family Farm Support Business may involve any one of a wide
range of uses, so long as the use is compatible with the primary agricultural use of the land. The
applicant must demonstrate that the Family Farm Support Business is compatible with the
existing rural setting of the municipality and will not create nuisances for nearby residences.
2. The Family Farm Support Business must be owned and operated by a person in residence of the
property.
3. Examples of Family Farm Support Businesses shall include the following: agricultural equipment
repair, welding, small machine repair, painting service, fencing service, sharpening service,
livestock grooming, shearing or trimming services, agricultural consulting services, specialized
small agricultural equipment and/or parts manufacturing, small-scale feed or fertilizer franchise,
butcher shops, blacksmith shops, carriage shop or harness shop, riding academies, riding stables,
horse boarding facility, woodworking.
4. No more than the equivalent of three (3) full time non-resident employees shall be employed by
the Family Farm Support Business.
5. The Family Farm Support Business shall occupy an area no greater than a maximum of four
thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area of any structure that is used for said business.
6. The maximum acreage devoted to a Family Farm Support Business (including the structure,
parking, storage, and driveway; if separate) shall be no more than five (5) contiguous acres.
7. Where practical, Family Farm Support Business shall be conducted within an existing farm
building; however, any new building constructed for use by the farm occupation shall:
a. Be located at least one hundred (100) feet from rear and side
property lines.
b. Meet, or exceed, the current EAP District front yard setback
requirements, as established in Section 455 of this Ordinance.
c. Be located within one hundred (100) feet of existing farm
buildings.
d. Not devote more than four thousand (4,000) square feet of the
57
gross floor area of said new structure to said business.
8. It must be shown to the Zoning Officers satisfaction that adequate space for employee parking,
customer parking, and turn-around areas for deliveries can be provided for use with existing
buildings and conditions. If new areas for parking and turn-around are to be created, they must
meet the requirements of Section 1509 of this Ordinance.
9. No outdoor storage of supplies, materials, or products shall be located within fifty (50) feet from
property lines. Such outdoor storage shall also be screened from adjoining roads and properties
per ESP SALDO.
10. One (1) free-standing sign shall be permitted for a Family Farm Support Business. Such signs
shall not exceed fifteen (15) square feet in total area and shall be regulated as per Section 1507 of
this Ordinance
11. No construction or other improvements required to support a Family Farm Support Business other
than those in existing farm buildings shall be permitted except pursuant to an approved Land
Development Plan.
12. The Zoning Officer shall review the application for compliance with this section, visit the
property, and approve or deny the application for the Family Farm Support Business Zoning
Permit.
Section 457. Subdivision and Land Development Permitted Within the EAP Zoning District.
Subdivision and land development shall be permitted in the EAP Zoning District, subject to the development
limitations and controls specified within this section of the Ordinance. Subdivision and land development is limited
to those EAP Parent Tracts as defined in subsection 457.A or to parcels which were allocated EAP Development
Units from said EAP Parent Tracts after the date of adoption of this ordinance.

Section 506. Family Farm Support Business
A. The Eastern Schuylkill Planning (ESP) Region recognizes the need to establish regulations pertaining to
farm-based occupations as a result of the increased need for the diversity of income for farmers to help
offset the rising cost of living. Such regulations must be developed in a manner which protects adjacent
agricultural uses from adverse effects. Since farm-based occupations in sparsely populated areas do not
typically represent a significant threat to adjacent property owners, the ESP Region has created regulations
for Family Farm Support Businesses in order to promote and preserve family farms within the
Municipalities. Within the A-P Zoning District, a Family Farm Support Business is permitted as a Use by
Right, subject to the following standards:
1. For the purposes of this Ordinance, Family Farm Support Business may involve any one of a wide
range of uses, so long as the use is compatible with the primary agricultural use of the land. The
applicant must demonstrate that the Family Farm Support Business is compatible with the existing
rural setting of the Municipality and will not create nuisances for nearby residences.
2. The Family Farm Support Business must be owned and operated by a person in residence of the
property.
3. Examples of Family Farm Support Businesses shall include the following: agricultural equipment
repair, welding, small machine repair, painting service, fencing service, sharpening service,
livestock grooming; shearing or trimming services; agricultural consulting services; specialized
small agricultural equipment and/or parts manufacturing, small-scale feed or fertilizer franchise,
65
butcher shops, blacksmith shops, carriage shop or harness shop, riding academies, riding stables,
horse boarding facility, woodworking.
4. No more than the equivalent of three (3) full time non-resident employees shall be employed by
the Family Farm Support Business.
5. The Family Farm Support Business shall occupy an area no greater than a maximum of four
thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area of any structure that is used for said business.
6. The maximum acreage devoted to a Family Farm Support Business (including the structure,
parking, storage, and driveway; if separate) shall be no more than five (5) contiguous acres.
7. Where practical, Family Farm Support Business shall be conducted within an existing farm
building; however, any new building constructed for use by the farm occupation shall:
a. Be located at least one hundred (100) feet from rear and side
property lines.
b. Meet, or exceed, the current A-P District front yard setback
requirements, as established in Section 505 of this Ordinance.
c. Be located within one hundred (100) feet of existing farm
buildings.
d. Not devote more than four thousand (4,000) square feet of the
gross floor area of said new structure to said business.
8. It must be shown to the Zoning Officers satisfaction that adequate space for employee parking,
customer parking, and turn-around areas for deliveries can be provided for use with existing
buildings and conditions. If new areas for parking and turn-around are to be created, they must
meet the requirements of Section 1509 of this Ordinance.
9. No outdoor storage of supplies, materials, or products shall be located within fifty (50) feet from
property lines. Such outdoor storage shall also be screened from adjoining roads and properties
per the ESP Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
10. One (1) free-standing sign shall be permitted for a Family Farm Support Business. Such signs
shall not exceed fifteen (15) square feet in total area and shall be regulated as per Section 1507 of
this Ordinance
11. No construction or other improvements required to support a Family Farm Support Business other
than those in existing farm buildings shall be permitted except pursuant to an approved Land
Development Plan.
12. The Zoning Officer shall review the application for compliance with this Section, visit the property,
and approve or deny the application for the Family Farm Support Business Zoning Permit.
Section 507. Subdivision and Land Development Permitted Within the A-P Zoning District.
Subdivision and land development shall be permitted in the Agricultural Preservation District (A-P), subject to the
development limitations and controls specified within this section of the Ordinance. Subdivision and land
development is limited to those A-P Parent Tracts as defined in Section 507.A or to parcels which were allocated
A-P Development Units from said A-P Parent Tracts after the date of adoption of this ordinance.
A. Definition of A-P Parent Tract. A-P Parent Tracts are contiguous tracts or land deeded either as a single
tract or as one deed with multiple purports existing as of the date of adoption of this ordinance that are
66
situate within the A-P Zoning District. In cases where individually deeded tracts of land are under single
ownership, each individually deeded tract will be considered to be its own A-P Parent Tract.
B. Subdivision and land development within the A-P District is allowed for the creation of the types of

dwelling on it which meets the requirements of Section 505 of this Ordinance and all other
provisions of this Ordinance. The A-P Development Unit may not be used for any other purpose
than the placement of a Single Family Dwelling upon the A-P Agricultural Lot; however
Agricultural Buildings as described in Section 201 which meet the requirements of this
Ordinance may be erected on an A-P Agricultural Lot.

Parent Tract as set forth in subsection 507.G of this Ordinance. This type of annexation shall not result in
an increase in the allocation of the A-P Development Units permitted by subsection 507.G of this
Ordinance to the A-P Parent Tract which is increased in size by the annexation, nor will the A-P
Agricultural Annexation Parcel be assigned A-P Development Units.
J. Any subdivision to create a lot which will be transferred to a municipality or a municipal authority created
by the Municipal Governing Body shall not be deducted from the A-P Development Units allocated to the
A-P Parent Tract as set forth in subsection 507.G of this Ordinance.

within twenty-five (25) miles of the location of the proposed farm-related business. The proposed Farm-related
Business should be directed at providing materials and services necessary to local farming and the processing and
distribution of goods produced on said farms; therefore, the applicant must provide evidence to the Municipal
Zoning Hearing Board that the proposed Farm-related Business is important to local farming and is specifically
sized to serve primarily local users. Additionally, Farm-related Businesses are subject to the following standards:
A. For the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, farm-related businesses may only involve the following types of
uses:

3. Butcher shops;
4. Grain mills;
5. Facilities devoted to the processing of locally produced agricultural products;
6. Feed supply, fuel and fertilizer distributors;
7. Other uses similar in character to those listed above.
B. The Farm-related Business shall occupy no more than five (5) acres. The applicant shall justify to the
Municipal Zoning Hearing Board that the size of the site is the minimum needed to conduct the farm-related
business.
C. By access drive which serve the Farm-related Business shall be of a sufficient length to accommodate
stacking of delivery and customer vehicles.
D. Farm-related Businesses shall not be permitted within fifty (50) feet of any property line.
E. Composting and other waste storage facilities shall not be permitted within two hundred (200) feet of any
property line. Additionally, any use permitted under subsection 508.A may require setbacks of a greater
width as may be determined by the Municipal Zoning Hearing Board.
F. Vegetative screening must be provided when a Farm-related Business abuts any property used principally
for residential purposes. Certain pieces of apparatus used for Farm-related Businesses which create
noxious dust, odor, light, or noise, may require setbacks and vegetative screening per the ESP Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance of a greater width or density as may be determined by the Municipal
Zoning Hearing Board.
70
G. Off-street parking, loading areas, and driveways shall be designated in accordance with Sections 1508 and
1509 of this Ordinance.
H. Any outdoor storage of supplies, materials and products shall be screened from adjoining roads and
properties. The display of mechanized farm equipment for sale shall be excluded from this screening
provision.
I. One (1) free-standing sign shall be permitted for a Farm-related Business. Such sign shall not exceed
fifteen (15) square feet in total area and shall be regulated as per Section 1507 of this Ordinance.
J. If, in the opinion of the Municipal Zoning Hearing Board, a proposed Farm-related Business presents a fire
hazard, emits smoke, dust or other air pollutants, noise, light or glare, or creates a nuisance as a result of the
hours of operation, the Municipal Zoning Hearing Board may attach reasonable conditions, as it deems
appropriate to adequately control and/or mitigate the potentially detrimental effects that any such Farmrelated
Business may have on the surrounding area.
K. No construction or other improvements required to support a Farm-related Business shall be permitted

(I).
I. Portable, A-Frame, and Wheeled Signs are permitted in the Commercial Districts (G-C, H-C).
1. These signs are as defined in this Ordinance.
2. Portable Signs are a particular type of sign that has the characteristics of a temporary sign, but that
has been or may have been inappropriately used as a permanent sign. This subsection, therefore,
will clearly require that if a permittee desires to regularly display a sign for regularly changing
messages then, that the permittee be directed by the Zoning Officer to obtain a zoning permit for a
permanent sign which shall comply all of the requirements of this Ordinance.
3. A Portable Sign, including any such sign that may have been displayed prior to the adoption of
this Ordinance and which does not have a lawful permit, shall only be permitted if it meets all of
the following requirements:
a. The portable Sign must be placed upon the lot of a permitted principal commercial use.
b. Any and all portable signs shall have a maximum total area of forty (40) square feet with
a maximum of two (2) sides.

J. Off-Premise Signs (Including Billboards and Advertising Signs).
1. Off-Premise Signs are further defined as:
A sign which directs attention to an object, product, service, place, activity, person, institution,
organization, or business that is offered or located at a location other than the lot upon which the
sign is located. This definition includes signs commonly called billboards and advertising
signs.
2. Off-Premise Signs are controlled by this Ordinance for the following purposes: to prevent visual
pollution in the ESP Region; to protect property values; to prevent glare from said signs adversely
affecting adjacent property and streets; to protect the open space and natural character of areas of
the ESP Region planned to remain agricultural, woodland, or rural preservation areas; to avoid the
creation of additional visual distractions to motorists, especially along the busy arterial streets that
involve complex turning movements, congestion and numerous traffic hazards; recognize that this
ordinance allows every landowner a reasonable use for their land; and to avoid to the extent
possible the placement of off-premise signs that would have an unfair advantage over on-premise
signs in the competition for attention, as off-premise signs are typically placed higher and are
typically larger than on-premise signs.
a. An Off-Premise Sign is only permitted in the G-C, H-C, L-I, and G-I Zoning Districts
and any and all such signs shall require a Zoning Permit.
b. An Off-Premise Sign is only permitted within a maximum of two hundred (200) feet of
an existing right-of-way of an arterial road and shall be placed a minimum of ten (10)
feet from any lot line. Any off-premises sign shall be setback a minimum of twenty (20)
feet from all existing and ultimate road rights-of-way. No off-premise sign shall be
located within two hundred (200) feet of any existing residential dwelling unit.
c. No Off-Premise Sign shall be attached in any way to any other off-premise sign. Off-
Premise Signs shall have a maximum of two (2) sign faces.
d. The maximum area of each sign face of any and all types of Off-Premise Signs shall be
three hundred (300) square feet.
e. Any and all Off-Premise Signs erected after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall be
separated by a minimum of one thousand (1,000) linear feet from any other off-premise
sign, including signs on either side of a street and including any existing signs located in
other municipalities.
f. The maximum height of any Off-Premise Sign shall be fifty (50) feet.
3. This Ordinance shall not require the removal of an existing, lawfully-placed, Off-Premise Sign
unless the Zoning Officer determines that any such sign is not in structurally sound condition.
4. This section applies to all types of Off-Premise Signs except as may be specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Ordinance.
101
5. Signs that are erected and maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (Penn
DOT) are permitted by right in all Districts. Such signs that identify business services available at
an interchange are specifically encouraged as an appropriate and orderly means of providing
information without causing visual pollution or traffic hazards.
K. Abandoned or Outdated Signs.
1. Signs advertising a business or use no longer in existence (other than a sign relating to a building
that is clearly temporarily vacant and being offered for lease by new tenants or for purchase by new
owners) shall be removed within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the cessation of such
business operation or use.
Section 1508. Loading Areas. An All-Weather Surface (as defined in this Ordinance) for off-street
loading and unloading spaces, with proper access from a street, driveway or alley, shall be provided on any lot on
which a commercial or industrial use and/or business is hereafter erected or established. All such areas for the
loading and unloading of vehicles, and for the servicing of establishments by refuse collection, fuel delivery and
other such service vehicles, shall be of such size, design and arrangement that said areas may be used without
blocking or otherwise interfering with the use of automobile access ways, customer or employee parking facilities,
and pedestrian walk ways. Loading areas shall not be located within required front yards or within five (5) feet of
any side or rear lot line.
The number and size of loading spaces provided shall be appropriate for the use to be conducted on the premises.
At least one (1) loading space having a minimum area of seven hundred twenty (720) square feet and minimum
dimensions of twelve (12) feet by sixty (60) feet shall be provided for each use. When a zoning permit is applied
for, the application for the permit shall show all provisions for off-street loading and shall include supporting data
(data on number, frequency and size of vehicles which will use the loading facilities) which would assist the
Municipal Zoning Officer in determining any reduction in the number of loading spaces to be provided.
Section 1509. Off-Street Parking Requirements, Access Drives, Drive-Through Facilities

refrigeration equipment) is running.
2. No boats, utility trailers, campers, travel trailers, tractors, or trailers from a tractor trailer truck
shall be stored or parked on a public or private street for more than twenty-four (24) hours within

fraction below one-fourth (1/4) may be disregarded and any fraction over one half (1/2) of a space shall
necessitate the provision of a full parking space.

S. Conditional Reduction of Parking Requirements
1. Under the Conditional Use Procedures Established in Section 2005 of this Ordinance, the
Governing Body may permit a conditional reduction of the number of parking spaces required by
this Ordinance; in individual cases, if in their sole discretion, the Governing Body believes that the
strict application of the parking requirements of this Ordinance could result in a land development
106
which would provide many more spaces than what maybe actually needed subject to the
following:
a. The design for the parcel of land in question shall show parking areas which provide the
total number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance and meet all the requirements
of this Ordinance. Those portions of parking spaces proposed for initial construction
shall be designated and their location is subject to the approval of the Governing Body.
b. Those portions of the parking areas which will not be initially constructed shall be
reserved for possible future construction of parking spaces and no other improvements
may be erected in the area designed for said future parking.
c. The landowner shall enter into a written agreement, satisfactory to the Governing Body,
that within eighteen (18) months after the issuance of the last Certificate of Use and
Occupancy on the tract the parking spaces not initially constructed shall be constructed at
the landowners expense should the Governing Body determine that the total number of
parking spaces required by this Ordinance are necessary to adequately serve the uses on
the lot. The landowner shall further enter into a written agreement to pay any costs
incurred by the Municipality in the undertaking of any studies to determine the adequacy
of parking facilities. If required by the Municipality, the landowner shall post a financial
guarantee, satisfactory to the Municipality, to cover the cost of additional parking
facilities which could be required by the Municipality and the cost of any studies
undertaken by the Municipality.
Section 1510. Front Yard Exceptions. When an unimproved lot is situated between two (2) improved
lots with front yard dimensions less than those required for the zoning district in which the unimproved lot is
located, the front yard required for the unimproved lot may be reduced to a depth equal to the average of the two (2)
adjoining lots; provided, however, that this provision shall only apply in such cases where the improved lots in
question were legally improved as of the effective date of this Ordinance. For the purpose of this section, an
unimproved lot shall be the same as a vacant lot and an improved lot shall be one on which a principal building has
been legally erected prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
Section 1511. Fences.
A. In all Districts, no fence, wall, or hedge may be erected or planted within the right-of-way lines of any
street nor may they encroach upon any street right-of-way at any time.

and the maximum height of a fence placed along boundary line of any commercial, industrial, or
institutional (except for prisons or hospitals housing the criminally insane) is ten (10) feet.
C. A fence may be increased one (1) foot in height for every five (5) feet the fence is situated from a
property line, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) feet in height except for fences placed as backstops on
baseball and/or softball fields.
D. On a corner lot, no fence may be erected or altered which may cause danger to the drivers of the vehicles
on a public road by obscuring the drivers view at t he intersection.

Section 1608. Cluster Development
A. Intent of Cluster Development in the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts of the ESP Region
1. Cluster development allows for the reduction of lot area and other bulk requirements so that dwellings
may be grouped in certain areas of the parent tract, while the remainder of the site is set aside as
common open space.
2. As one of the goals of the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts is to maintain large contiguous
agricultural parcels cluster development is consistent with this goal.
3. Within the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts, development is restricted in its intensity and limited in the
type of non-agricultural land uses allowed, therefore, the only allowable residential uses permitted in
these districts are single-family detached dwellings.
4. The intensity of development (e.g. how many lots or Development Units are allowed to be
created from a farm) is more restricted in the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts than in other zoning
districts in the ESP Region. The intent of cluster development in the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts is
to allow for more lots on less acres of land in a clustered arrangement while still making a good
faith effort to maintain the existence of large contiguous agricultural parcels through open space
requirements.
B. Site Requirements for Cluster Development Use.
1. Cluster Development shall be permitted as a Special Exception Use in the EAP and A-P Zoning
Districts.
2. Only tracts of land which are at least twenty-five (25) gross acres in size may propose a cluster
development.
3. The cluster development shall be served by both a public or private sewerage system and by a public
or private water system.
135
4. The tract of land to be developed shall be in single ownership.
5. At least 60% of the A-P tract of land and 70% of the EAP tract of land shall be permanently
preserved by deed restriction as open space and/or agricultural land.
6. All cluster developments shall be served by an internal private road network which shall be designed
and constructed to meet the standards set forth in the ESP SALDO.
7. All cluster developments which propose more than twenty-five (25) single family dwellings shall
provide two (2) points of access from said development to an existing public road.
C. Density and Dimensional Standards for Cluster Development
EAP A-P
1. Minimum Tract Size 25 Acres 25 Acres
2. Area, Yard, and Height Regulations for Cluster Development in the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts
a. Use - Single Family Detached Dwelling
i. Min. Lot Area - 15,000 sq. ft.
ii. Min. Lot Width - 100 feet
@ Lot Line
iii. Min. Lot Width - 100 feet
@ Setback Line
iv. Min. Front Yard 30 feet
v. Min. Side Yard 20 feet each side
vi. Min. Rear Yard 30 feet
3. Maximum Density of Cluster Development
a. The maximum density shall be determined by a Yield Plan. The Yield Plan will show the
maximum number of lots that could be developed on the parent tract using the cluster
development criteria contained in this Ordinance.
b. The Yield Plan shall, at minimum, contain the following:
i. A boundary survey signed and sealed by a Professional Land Surveyor (PLS)
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicating the gross area of the
Parent Tract.
ii. Any and all road rights of way.
iii. Utility rights of way, whether they were established by easement or fee simple
transactions.
iv. Areas of wetlands as determined via a Jurisdiction wetland delineation
performed by a qualified individual.
136
v. Areas containing slopes in excess of 25% as determined by a topographic survey
performed by a Professional Land Surveyor.
vi. Areas subject to floodplains determined either by using current FEMA maps; or,
in the case of an unmapped Stream via an actual calculated floodplain limit
derived from a field survey.
c. The Yield Plan shall indicate the gross acreage of each topographic feature listed in
C.3.b.ii through vi above. Where two (2) or more of these categories overlap, the
overlapping acreage shall be counted only once, using the most restrictive classification.
The acreages of these various topographic features shall be added together and this total
acreage figure shall be referred to as the Deducted Acreage.
d. The gross acreage of the Parent Tract minus the Deducted Acreage is then multiplied
by the open space coefficient (the percentage of the Parent Tract required to be preserved
as open space and/or agricultural land as stated in subsection B.5). The resultant figure is
the amount of area available for the cluster development of single family detached
dwellings.
(As an example an EAP Parent Tract is 100 gross acres. The Deducted Acreage for the
features indicated in subsection C.3.b.ii through v is 20 acres which results in 80 acres (100-20)
to be multiplied by 0.70 (70% open space). The result is 56 acres (80 x 0.70) which must be
preserved and 24 acres (80-56) which is available for cluster development).
D. Neighborhood Standards for Cluster Developments
1. All residential lots are required to be grouped into Neighborhoods according to the open space
residential provisions of the ESP SALDO.
2. Neighborhoods shall contain at least five (5) but no more than ten (10) lots surrounded by open land.
Neighborhoods are defined by the outer perimeter of houses in contiguous lots.
3. Neighborhoods shall be defined and separated by open land in order to provide direct access to open
space. Roads may not be used to separate adjacent neighborhoods unless one or more of the following
are provided:
a. The road is designed as a parkway with a minimum 10-foot wide planted median.
b. A fifty (50) foot setback is provided along one side of the road measured from the right of way line
to the closest residential lot line.
c. A landscape buffer, that forms an effective visual screen, shall be planted within said fifty (50) foot
setback.
4. Neighborhood residential lots shall not be directly accessed from existing state or township roads. All
lots in a neighborhood shall take access from interior private roads.
5. Views of neighborhoods from exterior roads shall be minimized by existing vegetation and/or
additional landscaping, but in all cases, said landscaping, shall be designed in a way to preserve scenic
views.
E. Neighborhood Setbacks for Cluster Developments
1. Twenty-five (25) feet from wetlands or floodplain.
137
2. One hundred (100) feet from public roads adjoining the Parent Tract.
3. Fifty (50) feet from the Parent Tracts external boundaries.
4. Seventy-five (75) feet (unless subsection D.3 is utilized) from other neighborhoods within the same
cluster development.
5. All setbacks along public roads shall be planted with a vegetative landscaped buffer in order to screen
the view of the cluster development from the traveling public.
Section 1609. Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)
A. Primary Purpose
The primary purpose of the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Section of this Ordinance is to
permanently preserve open land, agricultural land, sensitive natural areas, and rural community character
that would be lost if the land were developed. In addition, this Section is intended to establish the
procedures for the transfer of developments rights (TDRs) from EAP or AP zoned tracts to eligibly zoned
areas within the ESP Region.
B. Specific Intent
Within the ESP Region, there are certain areas that, because of their unique natural resources, make them
worthy of special protection. In accordance with Sections 603(c) (2), 605(4), and 619.1. of the
Municipalities Planning Code, a transferable development rights (TDR) program is hereby established
within the ESP Region, and the ESP Region designates the EAP (Enhanced Agricultural Preservation), and
the A-P (Agricultural Preservation) as the Sending Areas (as defined in this Zoning Ordinance), and the R-
3, R-4, and R-5 residential districts as the Receiving Areas (as defined in this Zoning Ordinance). The
purpose of the transfer of development rights program is to preserve the agricultural soils and agricultural
character of the lands in the EAP and A-P agricultural districts by shifting development from those areas to
the areas for designated residential development within the ESP Region.
C. Concept
The transfer of development rights (TDR) is a voluntary agreement under the terms of this section of this
Ordinance between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The TDRs shall be transferred to a person,
corporation, partnership or other legal entity, or a municipality within the ESP Region. The TDRs may be
held by the purchaser for future use or sale or may be immediately attached to a specific parcel of land
within the Receiving Areas of the ESP Region. The TDRs shall be considered a separate estate in land
and may be transferred subject to the limitations of this Section. Once the TDRs are attached to a specific
parcel of land, those rights shall run with that specific parcel in perpetuity.
A purchaser of TDRs who attaches those rights to a tract of land located in a Receiving Area in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section is permitted an increase, with the use of the development
rights, in the density of his development within the Receiving Area. The seller of the said TDRs in the
Sending Area receives compensation from the sale plus the right to retain the land for agricultural use. A
deed restriction against future development is placed upon the agricultural land in the designated Sending
Area from which the TDRs have been obtained by the willing buyer.
The deed restriction will not affect the landowners ability to sell the land after the development rights have
been severed, although such land cannot be sold for development purposes. The deed restriction on the
land from which the development rights have been severed shall run in favor of the municipality in which
the sending property is located.
138
The owner of the tract in the Sending Area from which the development rights are severed or any
subsequent purchaser or purchasers of the development rights may hold the development rights or may
resell the development rights. The only use which may be made of the development rights is the ultimate
transfer to a developer with a tract in the Receiving Area. The municipality shall have no obligation to
purchase the development rights which have been severed from a tract in the Sending Area.
1. A developer who has not purchased TDRs shall only have the right to:
develop a tract in the Receiving Area as a subdivision or land development using the minimum lot
sizes found in the applicable ESP Zoning District regulations; and the maximum density for such
developments will be those of the R-3, R-4, or R-5 Zoning District.
2. A developer who has purchased TDRs shall have the right to increase the allowable densities by:
a. providing public or privately owned potable water and sewerage services.
b. acquiring the number of TDRs necessary to increase the allowable density of dwelling
unit types which are permitted in the R-3, R-4, and R-5 zoning districts.
D. Recognition of Transferable Development Rights
The ESP Region hereby recognizes the severability and transferability of development rights from certain
lands within a municipality of the ESP Region to be transferred and used in accordance with the provisions
hereof.
Each municipality in the ESP Region, in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection G.,
Apportionment of Development Rights of the section, shall determine the eligibility of each tract of land
within the EAP and A-P Zoning Districts for allocation of Transferable Development Rights. The
municipality has no obligation, however, to determine the specific number of such rights apportioned to
each tract, nor to give any formal notice to the landowner other than by the passage of this Ordinance, until
such time as an application to utilize Transferable Development Rights is made in accordance with
subsection G., Apportionment of Development Rights and subsection H., Transfer and Use of Transferable
Development Rights, of this Ordinance.
The ESP Regions municipalities reserve the right to amend this Section in the future, and the ESP
Regions municipalities expressly reserve the right to change the manner in which the number of
development rights shall be apportioned to a tract in the Sending Area, the manner in which development
rights may be attached to land within the Receiving Area, the locations of the Sending Area and the
Receiving Areas and the procedure by which development rights can be conveyed. The ESP Regions
municipalities further expressly reserve the right to terminate the transferable development rights program
at any time. No owner of land or owner of development rights shall have any claim against the
municipalities of the ESP Region for damages resulting from a change in this section of the Ordinance
relating to the regulations governing the apportionment, transfer and use of development rights or the
abolition of the Transferable Development Rights program. If the Transferable Development Rights
program is abolished by the ESP Regions municipalities, no developer may attach development rights to
any tract in the Receiving Area after the effective date of any ordinance abolishing the Transferable
Development Rights program unless an application in conformity with the provisions of Section G herein
was filed prior to the effective date of any such amending or abolishing ordinance.

G. Apportionment of Development Rights
1. Development rights shall be apportioned to tracts of land within the designated Sending
Area of a municipality based on the following criteria:
a. The tract of land shall be located within either the EAP or the A-P Zoning Districts.
b. The tract of land shall not be less then twenty-five (25) acres in size.
c. Tracts of land or portions thereof owned by or subject to easements (including, but not
limited to, easements of roads, railroads, electrical transmission lines, and water, gas or
petroleum pipelines) in favor of governmental agencies, utilities, and nonprofit
corporations shall not be eligible for Transferable Development Rights.
d. Land restricted against development by covenant, easement, or deed restriction shall not
be eligible for Transferable Development Rights unless and until such time as said
covenant, restriction, or easement is dissolved or rescinded. In the event said covenant,
restriction, or easement is dissolved or rescinded, such land shall be eligible for issuance
of Transferable Development Rights.
e. Land utilized for uses other than agriculture shall not be eligible for Transferable
Development Rights.
140
2. The number of Transferable Development Rights apportioned to an eligible tract shall be
established by subsection G.4.c of this Ordinance.
3. The owner of any EAP or A-P Parent Tract eligible for development rights shall be restricted from
developing said tract in accordance with other Sections of this Ordinance.
4. The determination of the precise number of development rights which shall be apportioned to a
tract in the Sending Area shall be computed as such:
a. The tract of land in the Sending Area to be apportioned shall be known as the Sending Tract.
b. The owner of the Sending Tract shall prepare an Apportionment Plan to determine the number
of TDRs which can be apportioned to the Sending Tract.
c. The Apportionment Plan shall be prepared to meet the following criteria:
i. Apportionment Plan shall be a 1 = 50 scale drawing:
ii. Apportionment Plan may show a deed plot of Sending Tract or a boundary
survey signed and sealed by a Professional Land Surveyor.
iii. The Apportionment Plan shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a PLS, PE, or

iv. The Apportionment Plan shall state the Gross Acreage of the Sending Tract
(as determined by deed plot or survey). The Gross Acreage will be used in the
calculation of TDRs.
v. The Apportionment Plan shall state the acreage of wetlands, determined either by
available NWI Maps; Soil Lines per the Schuylkill County Soils Survey, USDA,
SCD, July 1982 or soils containing major hydric components, or inclusions of
hydric components; or a wetland delineation by a qualified individual.

determined either by current FEMA maps; the soil lines of the At, Ba, Ln, Ph
and Po soils; or a survey to determine soils.
vii. The Apportionment Plan shall state the acreage of areas subject to slopes in
excess of 25% as determined either by USGS mapping or a topographic survey
performed by a Professional Land Surveyor.
viii. The Apportionment Plan shall state the acreage of each feature above as well as
the aggregate. Where two (2) or more categories overlap, the overlapping
acreage shall be counted only once, using the most restrictive classification. The
aggregate acreage will be known as the Deducted Acreage and will be used in
the calculation of TDRs.
ix. The Apportionment Plan shall show the following formula and the subsequent
calculation to determine the Sending Tracts Acreage Eligible for TDR
Calculation (of TDRs) or (S.T.A.E.C):
(Gross Acreage)  (Deducted Acreage) = (S.T.A.E.C. of TDR)
141
x. The S. T. A. E. C. multiplied by the EAP coefficient (.30) or the A-P coefficient
(.40) will determine the number of TDRs apportioned to the Sending Tract:
[I] S. T. A. E. C. x .30 = the number of TDRs apportioned to the Sending Tract in
the EAP Zoning District.
[II] S. T. A. E. C. x .40 = the number of TDRs apportioned to the Sending Tract in
the A-P Zoning District.
d. The Apportionment Plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Municipalitys Engineer
and Governing Body.
5. Once an Apportionment Plan has been approved, the Transferable Development Rights which
have been apportioned shall be conveyed by a Deed of Transferable Rights duly recorded in the
Office of the Schuylkill County Recorder of Deeds.
a. The Deed of Transferable Development Rights shall specify: the tract of land within the
receiving district to which the rights shall be permanently attached or that the rights shall
be transferred to a 1) municipality, 2) the owner of the Sending Tract, or 3) another
person in gross.
b. The Deed of Transferable Development Rights which severs the development rights from
the Sending Tract shall be accompanied by a Declaration of Restriction of Development
which shall permanently restrict development of the Sending Tract and which shall be
recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds at the same time as, or prior to, the Deed
of Transferable Development Rights.
c. All Deeds of Transferable Development Rights shall be endorsed by a municipality prior
to recording.
d. The owner of the Sending Tract from which the development rights are to be severed
shall, by a Declaration of Restriction of Development, totally and permanently restrict the
future development of the tract. The Declaration of Restriction of Development shall be
in a form approved by a Municipal Solicitor. All owners of the tract from which
development rights are severed shall execute the Declaration of Restriction of
Development. All lien holders of the tract from which development rights are severed
shall execute a joiner and/or consent to the Declaration of Restriction of Development.
i. The said Declaration of Restriction of Development shall designate a municipality as a
third party beneficiary of the restrictions imposed on the land from which the
development rights are severed, and said restrictions shall be enforceable by the
municipality as such third party beneficiary. The municipality shall hold the rights
granted by the Declaration of Restriction of Development as trustee for all of the
residents of the municipality, in recognition of the right of the people to the
preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the municipality
and in further recognition of the fact that these resources are the common property of
all the residents of the municipality, including generations yet to come.
ii. Land from which development rights have been severed shall be permanently
restricted against development; shall continue to be owned subject to said restrictions
by the landowner, his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns; and

during which a landowner secures assurance that the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map under which he proposed to
build is free from challenge, and recognizing that the procedure for preliminary approval of his/her development
may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable, the landowner may advance the date from which time for any
challenge to the applicable Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map will run under Section 914.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Codes, as amended, by the following procedures:
A. The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his proposed use or development to the

weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality. Such notice shall include a general
description of the proposed use or development and its location, by some readily identifiable directive, and
the place and time where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public. The favorable
preliminary approval under Section 914.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,

jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or
body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings

applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons
to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.

frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the
applicant for a bond to prove that the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence presented, if
the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition
the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be
revoked by him/her if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.

or in equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to
prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and
to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or
premises. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the
seller or transformer from such penalties or the
remedies herein provided. This authority to deny such
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following
applicants:
2. The owner of record at the time of such violation.
3. The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time
of such violation without regard as to whether such
vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge
of the violation.

subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to
69
whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
5. The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record
who acquired the property subsequent to the time of
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or
lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation.
As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the
granting of an approval to any such owner, current owner,
vendee or lessee for the development of any such real property,
the governing body may require compliance with the conditions
that would have been applicable to the property at the time the
applicant had an interest in such real property.
B. ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
1. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which
has violated of this Ordinance shall, upon being found
liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the governing body, pay a judgment of
not more than $600.00 plus all court costs, including
attorney fees incurred by the governing body as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the governing body may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the district
justice determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for
the person, partnership or corporation violating the
Ordinance to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event, there shall be deemed to
have been only one violation by the district justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall be
considered a separate violation.
2. The Court of Common Pleas, under petition, may grant
an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per

violation.

take no formal action to either approve or disapprove a
Sketch Plan.

body shall be required to take any action with respect
to a Sketch Plan Review.
SECTION 404. MINOR SUBDIVISION
A. Classification

roadway system to accommodate the future
traffic shall be described. The study shall take
into account not only the proposed use by the
applicant, but also other uses and developments
that have received building permits or
preliminary subdivision or land development
92
approval from a municipality. Future levels of
service shall be determined for all affected
streets and intersections in the study area. The
study shall include the projected directions of
generated traffic. Assessments of the relative
balance between roadway volumes and
capacities shall be performed for future
conditions.

at entrances to the development and other
major unsignalized intersections in the study
area shall be studied to determine whether a
traffic signal is warranted by Penn DOT
criteria.
viii. Needed Improvements. The study shall include
suggestions on how each congested or
hazardous intersection in the study area should
be improved to reduce the hazard or
congestion, and a rough estimate of the costs of
that improvement.
ix. Applicants Proposal. The applicant shall
respond to the traffic study with proposals on
what traffic improvements, right-of-way
dedications or commitments of financing for
specific projects the applicant proposes to
commit to resolve the negative traffic impacts
of the proposed development. Such
improvements or financing may be staged in
relation to the stages of the development.
x. Completion of Improvements. Any traffic
improvements, including but not limited to
traffic signals, that are required as a condition
of any approval under this Ordinance shall be
93
in place or sufficient funds committed by the
developer in escrow acceptable to the

easement not less than twenty (20) feet wide as
approved by the Municipal Engineer.
Properly designed, graded and turfed drainage swales
shall be permitted in lieu of storm sewers, where
approved by the Municipal Engineer. Swales shall be
located within an easement not less than twenty (20)
feet wide, but of sufficient width to allow access for
maintenance.
Such swales shall be designed not only to carry the
required discharge without excessive erosion, but also
to increase the time of concentration, reduce the peak
discharge and velocity and permit the water to
percolate into the soil. The minimum grassed swale
grade shall be 1% and all swales shall be designed with
a minimum 6 of freeboard.

determine during construction that watertight
connections are required.
3. Storm sewers shall be designed based upon the
following criteria:
i. Any changes in alignment shall be
accomplished utilizing straight connections
connected by inlets or manholes.
ii. When there is a change in pipe size through a
structure, the top inside elevation of the outlet
pipe shall be at or below the elevations of all
incoming pipes.
125
iii. Storm sewer sizes shall be determined based
upon the following design storm frequencies:
(a) ten (10) years in all residential
subdivisions or land developments with
an average gross density of less than six
(6) units per acre, and

(a) Inlets shall generally be located at the
lowest point of street intersections to
intercept the storm water before it
reaches pedestrian crossings or at sag
points of vertical curves in the street
alignment which provides a natural
point of ponding of surface storm water.
(b) At street intersections, inlets shall be
placed in the tangent and not the curved
portion of the curbing.
(c) Where the Governing Body deems it
necessary because of special land
requirements, they may approve special
inlets.
(d) The interval between inlets serving
stormwater runoff flow along the curb
shall not exceed a maximum of 1,000
126
feet when located along any one
continuous curb line. More frequent
spacing shall be required when the
entrance capacity of any individual inlet
warrants closer spacing as determined
by calculations which incorporate
consideration of the area drained,
intensity of rainfall, slope or grade,
runoff coefficient of imperviousness
and cross-sectional are of the gutter.
(e) When inlets are used in a storm system within
the right-of-way limits of a street in lieu of
manholes, the spacing of such inlets shall not
exceed the maximum distance of three hundred
(300) feet along any one continuous line.

(c) Manhole shall not be more than three
hundred (300) feet apart on sizes up to
twenty-four inches (24) and not more
than four hundred and fifty (450) feet
apart on larger sizes. Inlets may be
substituted for manholes on approval by
the Municipality.
vi. The construction of endwalls shall be required
at ends of all storm water conveyance
structures.
(a) Generally, these structures will be built
of 3,000 psi concrete, except in special
cases 3500 psi may be required by the
127
Municipal Engineer. Special care shall
be used by the design engineer to select
the proper endwall to fit the condition.
(b) The Design Engineer shall provide
energy dissipaters at endwalls where the
discharge velocity with pipe flowing
full is more than 1 f.p.s.
vii. Storm water roof drains shall not discharge
water directly over a sidewalk or into any
sanitary sewer line.
G. Bridges and culverts shall have ample waterway to carry
expected flows, based on a minimum storm frequency of
twenty-five (25) years. Bridge and/or culvert construction
shall be in accordance with the PennDOT specifications and
shall meet the requirements of DEP.

expected to change for future planning, the cartway of
the bridge shall be made to anticipate this condition.
On either side of the bridge cartway, the bridge railing
must be set back from the edge of the final cartway and
this area may be used to place sidewalks, present or
future.

HEC-2 or similar approved computer model). If the
HEC-2 model is used, the applicant shall submit a
128
computer disc containing all input files for the
calculations.
3. Where approved by the Municipal Engineer, the
Manning Equation may be used for relatively small
drainage areas.
4. An average of three (3) of the methods below may be
used to compute the design flow(s) upon prior
approval by the Municipality:
i. The graphical and tabular hydrograph methods
in Technical Release No. 55, Urban
Hydrology for Small Watershed, latest edition,
by the United States Department of Agriculture
Soil Conservation Service. The graphical
method may be used for streams whose
drainage area at the point of interest is no larger
than 2,000 acres, and the tabular hydrograph
method may be used for drainage areas up to
twenty (20) square miles.
ii. The Rational Method may be used for streams
whose drainage area at the point of interest is
no larger than 320 acres.
iii. The method in Water Protection Bulletin
Number 13, Floods in Pennsylvania, issued by
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, may be used for streams whose

proposed location will be conducted to determine
129
susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include
measures to prevent groundwater contamination and,
where necessary, sinkhole formation. Soils used for
the construction of basins shall have low erodibility
factors (K factors). The Municipality may require an
impermeable liner to be installed up to the 100-year
design water surface elevation.
3. Energy dissipaters and/or lever spreaders shall be
installed at points where pipes or drainageways
discharge to or from basins. Generally, outlet pipes
designed to carry the pre-development, 2 year storm
flow will be permitted to discharge to a stream with
only an energy dissipater. Storms of a 10 year or
greater intensity should be spread across floodplain by
level spreaders; rock material found on the site is
suggested for their construction.
4. The following slope restrictions shall apply to basins:
i. Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not
exceed one (1) foot vertical for three (3) feet
horizontal, and may be further reduced if the
soil has unstable characteristics.

hour will not fill the basin in one (1)
hour; or
(c) Where concrete, stone or brick walls are
used with side slopes proposed to be
steeper than one (1) foot vertical in
three (3) feet horizontal, in which case
the basins shall be fenced by a
permanent wire fence forty-eight (48)
inches in height and a ramp of durable,
non-slip materials for maintenance
vehicles shall be provided for access
into the basin.
130
iii. The minimum bottom slope shall be two
percent (2%) for grass, and 0.75% for concrete
paving. One percent (1%) may be used for
grass if an underdrain system is provided. A
concrete low flow channel shall be required for
all basins where the distance from the inlet pipe
to the outlet structure exceeds one hundred
(100) feet. The minimum channel width shall
be four (4) feet and the design must be

discharge flows and distribute the flows by pipes to
discharge areas shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete, and shall have childproof, non-clogging trash
racks over all design openings exceeding twelve (12)
inches in diameter, except those openings designed to
carry perennial stream flows. Emergency spillways
shall be designed to safely convey the 100-year basin
inflow hydrograph through the basin assuming the
131
principal outlet is completely blocked, and a minimum
six (6) inch freeboard shall be provided. The spillway
shall be lined with suitable erosion resistant material.
7. Inlet and outlet structures shall be located at maximum
distances from one another. The Municipality may
require a rock filter berm or rock-filled gabions
between inlet and outlet areas when the distance is
deemed insufficient for sediment trappings.
8. Permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall be
established on the sides of all earthen basins by
hydroseeding within five (5) days of initial
construction. The Municipality may require jute or
erosion control matting to be installed inside the basin
or on the basin embankment.
9 If the basin will not discharge to a suitable natural
drainage course, the Municipality may require the
Developer to provide facilities to safely and efficiently
convey the discharge to a suitable drainage course.
Securing of necessary drainage easements for this
purpose shall be the sole responsibility of the
Developer.
10. When PA DEP requires facilities to have a State
permit, the designer shall submit all information to PA
DEP and obtain all necessary approval and permits.
No stormwater facility shall create health or sanitation
problems. Consideration shall be given to safety
standards.
J. All calculations shall be submitted to the Municipal Engineer
on computation sheets for approval. If, in the opinion of the
Municipal Engineer, the size of pipes or holding pond is
insufficient, the Governing Body may require the developer to
increase the size of pipes or capacity of holding pond. If the
storm drainage system design is completed on a computer
installation, sufficient supporting data shall be provided to
allow comprehensive review by Municipal officials.
K. Intercepting underdrains shall be required at all locations in
which subsurface water is encountered which may permeate or
endanger the subgrade of the street. Underdrains may be
required in cuts three (3) feet deep and greater, and in all other
132
locations stipulated by the Municipal Engineer. Pipe
foundation underdrain shall consist of a trench excavated to a
minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches below the
underneath elevation of the special subgrade and to the
minimum width of eighteen (18) inches in which a six (6) inch
pipe underdrain shall be laid. The trench shall be backfilled
with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 2B
Aggregate to its full depth around and above the laid pipe.
1. If the length of pipe underdrain exceeds 600 feet in one
run, the minimum diameter of six (6) inches shall be
increased to eight (8) beyond that point. Pipe shall
meet Penn DOT, Form 408 Specifications.
L. Within all subdivisions in which off street storm or sanitary
sewers are to be constructed, or are anticipated for future
construction, a twenty (20) foot maintenance easement shall
be provided for such easement shown in the subdivision plans
which are submitted to the governing Municipal authorities for
their approval. Existing watercourses which are under the
jurisdiction of the PA DEP into which stormwater is permitted
to be deposited shall require an easement within or adjacent to
its banks equal to the 100 year floodplain.

restricted and indicated on the approved plans unless
otherwise assumed by the Municipality and/or others. The
Municipality may perform necessary maintenance and repairs
to detention basins if the owner(s) fail to do so after receiving
notice from the Municipality. The Municipality may recover
the cost of such necessary maintenance and repairs from the
property owner. The Municipality shall require the property
owner(s) to enter into an Agreement with the Municipality
setting forth such maintenance standards.
SECTION 609. EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION POLLUTION
CONTROL
