ARTICLE I
Police Pension Fund
[Adopted 10-14-1974 as Ch. 22, Art. II, of the 1974 Code]
§ 50-1. Establishment of fund.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Act of May 29, 1956, P.L. 1804, as
amended,13 the Borough of Homestead hereby establishes an insured Police
Pension Fund to be funded through the purchase of a deposit administration
group annuity contract and a group life insurance contract through J.J.
Markotan & Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
§ 50-2. Maintenance of fund.
The fund is to be maintained by a charge against each member of the
police force, by annual appropriations made by the Borough of Homestead,
by payments made by the State Treasurer to the Borough of Homestead
Treasurer from the moneys received from taxes paid on premiums by
foreign casualty insurance companies for purposes of pension for
policemen, and by gifts, grants, devises or bequests granted to such pension
fund pursuant to the provisions of such Act.
§ 50-3. Direction and application; disability payments.
§ 50-4. Money or property held in trust.
The Borough of Homestead is hereby authorized to take by gift, grant,
devise or bequest any money or property, real, personal or mixed, in trust
for the benefit of such fund. The care, management, investment and
disposal of such trust funds or property shall be vested in the Borough
of Homestead Council, the person, agent and the company having the
management of such Police Pension Fund, and said trust funds shall be
A. Such Police Pension Fund shall be under the direction of the Borough of
Homestead Council and shall be applied under such regulations as the
members of Council of the Borough of Homestead may, by ordinance or
resolution, prescribe for the benefits of such members of the Borough of
Homestead police force as shall receive honorable discharge therefrom
by reason of age and service, or disability, and for the families of such as
may be killed in the service.
B. If any disability payment are allowed to those who are disabled, it shall
be in conformity with the uniform scale and any special agreement
between the members of the Police Department and the Borough
Council and shall be integrated to make up the total payments needed
as a result of any liabilities of the Borough which may exist under any
previous act or acts of the legislature of this commonwealth pertaining
to such policemen's disabilities.
13.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 761 et seq.
§ 50-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 50-4
1:31
governed thereby subject to such directions not inconsistent therewith as
the donors of such funds and property may prescribe.
§ 50-5. Required service; early retirement benefits. [Amended
12-9-1977 by Ord. No. 921; 5-12-1978 by Ord. No. 925; 12-31-1990
by Ord. No. 1004]
A. The Borough of Homestead prescribes a minimum period of total
service in the aggregate of 25 years in the Borough of Homestead, and
shall fix the age of the members of the force at 50 years, after which
they may retire from active duty, and such members as are retired shall
be subject to service, from time to time as a police reserve, in cases of
riot, tumult or preservation of the public peace, until unfitted for such
service when they may be finally discharged by reason of age or
disability. Should any member of the Police Department, before
reaching his normal eligible retirement date, based on age and years of
service requirements, but after having completed 12 years of total
service, for any reason ceases to be employed as a full-time police
officer by the Borough of Homestead, he shall be entitled to vest his
retirement benefits by filing with the Borough within 90 days of the
date he ceases to be a full-time police officer, a written notice of his
intention to vest. Upon reaching the date which would have been his
normal eligible retirement date, based on age and years of service
requirements, had he continued to be employed as a full-time police
officer, he shall be paid a retirement benefit determined by applying the
percentage of his years of service bears to the years of service which he
would have rendered had he continued to work until his normal eligible
retirement date to the gross pension, using the monthly average salary
during the 36 months prior to his termination of employment.
B. Early retirement benefits. The Borough of Homestead Police Pension
Fund hereby provides for an early retirement benefit. The early
retirement benefit shall be provided to a full-time police officer with 20
or more years of full-time service who terminates employment prior to
the completion of superannuation retirement age and service
requirements and who files a written application for an early retirement
benefit. The early retirement benefit shall become effective as of the
date the application is filed with the Borough of Homestead or the date
designated on the application, whichever is later, and shall be the
actuarial equivalent of a partial superannuation retirement benefit
calculated as follows: [Added 4-14-2005 by Ord. No. 1168]
(1) A partial superannuation retirement benefit shall be determined by
applying the percentage that the police officer's years of service
bear to the years of service that the police officer would have
rendered had he or she continued to he employed until his or her
superannuation retirement date to the gross pension amount
calculated using the monthly average salary during the appropriate
period prior to his or her termination of employment.
§ 50-4 HOMESTEAD CODE § 50-5
1:32
§ 50-6. Military service credited.
Any member of the police force employed by the Borough of Homestead
who has been a regular appointed employee of the Borough of Homestead
for a period of at least six months and who thereafter shall enter into the
military service of the United States shall have credited to his employment
record, for pension or retirement benefits, all of the time spent by him in
such military service if such person returns or has heretofore returned to
his employment within six months after his separation from the service.
§ 50-7. Basis for determining pension. [Amended 12-9-1977 by Ord.
No. 921; 5-12-1978 by Ord. No. 925]
(2) The actuarial equivalent of the partial superannuation retirement
benefit shall be determined by actuarially reducing the partial
superannuation retirement benefit to reflect that it will commence
on the effective date of the early retirement rather than on the date
on which the police officer would have completed superannuation
age and service requirements. The actuarial reduction shall be
calculated using the actuarial assumptions reporting in the last
actuarial valuation report filed with the Public Employee
Retirement Commission under the Act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.
1005, No. 205), known as the "Municipal Pension Plan Funding
Standard and Recovery Act."
A. "Monthly compensation," whenever referred to within the Borough of
Homestead Police Pension Fund Ordinances and/or amendments, shall
mean the total amount of money received for services performed for the
Borough of Homestead, except moneys received or earned as unused
sick leave.
B. Payments made to such Police Pension Fund shall not be a charge on
any fund in the treasury of the Borough of Homestead or under its
control, save the Police Pension Fund herein provided for. The basis for
determining any pension payable under this article following the
retirement of any members of the force meeting the service and age
qualifications of this article shall be as follows:
(1) For police officers retiring on or after January 1, 2016, monthly
pension or retirement benefits shall be equal to 50% of the monthly
average compensation of such officer during the last consecutive
36 months of employment plus the lesser of 50% of the monthly
average overtime pay, detail pay, holiday pay, court pay of such
police officer during the last consecutive 36 months of employment
or 60% of the monthly average overtime pay, detail pay, holiday pay,
court pay of such member during the last consecutive 60 months of
employment; and this benefit shall be payable to the police officer
for as long as he or she lives; and there shall be a minimum of 60
monthly payments guaranteed. For police officers retiring prior to
January 1, 2016, monthly pension or retirement benefits for full-

J. J. Markotan & Company to determine the present value of the liability
on account of pensions payable under § 50-25 of this article to original
members for service prior to the date of the establishment of this fund, and
shall offset the value of any assets transferred to this fund from the previous
fund established by the Borough of Homestead, to determine the unfunded
liability. The unfunded liability shall be paid entirely by the Borough of
Homestead, provided that it may be funded over a period not to exceed
25 years. The actuary shall also determine the amount which shall be
contributed annually into the fund for the service of members subsequent
to the establishment of the fund, to be known as "future service cost."
§ 50-10. Payment into fund by members. [Amended 12-9-1977 by
Ord. No. 921; 5-12-1978 by Ord. No. 925]
Members shall pay into the fund, monthly, an amount equal to not less
than 5% nor more than 8% of their monthly compensation until they retire
from active service. The remainder of the needed annual contribution,
as determined by the actuary, shall be the obligation of the Borough of
Homestead and shall be paid by it to the pension fund by annual
appropriations.
time police officers who retire shall be 50% of the monthly average
salary of such police officer during the last consecutive 36 months
of employment, and this benefit shall be payable to the police
officer for as long as he or she lives, and there shall be a minimum
of 60 monthly payments guaranteed. [Amended 7-14-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-07]
(2) Such pension or retirement benefits for any month shall be
computed as the sum of:
(a) Any pension benefits from pension plans heretofore
established by a private organization or association for the
members of the police force.
(b) Benefits from the Police Pension Fund established pursuant to
this article to the extent necessary to bring the total benefits in
any one month up to, but no more than, the average monthly
pension or retirement benefit amount payable pursuant to the
applicable calculation formula set forth in § 50-7B(1) above.

police officer for as long as he or she lives. For police officers retiring
before January 1, 2016, monthly pension or retirement benefits for fulltime
police officers who retire shall be 50% of the monthly average
salary of such police officer during the last consecutive 36 months of
employment and shall be payable to the police officer for as long as he
or she lives. Full-time police officers retiring prior to January 1, 2016,

to the extent that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of its

article to the extent necessary to bring the total benefits in any one
month up to, but not more than, the average monthly pension or
retirement benefit amount payable pursuant to the calculation

her death. The surviving spouse shall not be eligible to receive this
survivor pension benefit payment if the surviving spouse remarries
on or before April 17, 2002.
(2) If no spouse survives the full-time police officer or if the spouse
survives the full-time police officer and subsequently dies, or if the
spouse remarries on or before April 17, 2002, thereby rendering
said spouse ineligible to receive the survivor pension benefit, then

reimburse the Borough of Homestead for the expense of such extraordinary
police protection.
§ 59-5. Calculation of expense.
The expense of such extraordinary police protection shall be calculated by

event or public assemblage.

§ 89-2. Purpose.
The Borough of Homestead's business and residential districts are in
serious danger of blight and decay, and concentrations of adult businesses
in the neighborhood discourages people from locating their homes and
businesses nearby. The Borough recognizes and is quite concerned that
there are some business uses, which because of their very nature and
purpose, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated in
certain areas which could have a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas.
In these instances it becomes quite necessary that special ordinances and
regulations be passed and followed to ensure that these adverse effects will
not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding business
and residential neighborhoods.
§ 89-3. Location near residential areas.
It is shall be unlawful to establish or maintain any adult bookstore, adult
motion-picture theater, adult mini motion-picture theater or cabaret within

It shall be unlawful to establish or maintain any adult bookstore, adult
motion-picture theater, adult mini motion-picture theater or cabaret any
closer than 1,000 feet of any of the following uses:
§ 89-5. Board of Adjustment waivers.
The Council of the Borough of Homestead, recognizing the above problems
as stated in § 85-2 and finding a compelling public interest in the
preservation of residential and business areas nevertheless, delegates to
its Board of Adjustment the authority that these prohibitions in §§ 89-3 and
89-4 may be waived upon the determination of the following:
A. Adult theater, adult mini motion-picture theater, amusement enterprise,
cabaret, dance hall, hotel or motel, pool hall, licensed liquor
establishment, massage establishment, model studio or sexual
encounter or meditation center.

injurious to near or adjacent properties.

will not be injuriously affected as to continuing long-term residential
occupancy or business expansion or development, as to value or
otherwise, nor contribute, enlarge or encourage the development of a
blighted or downgraded area surrounding residential neighborhood or
business districts.

of the establishment, including but not limited to owners, tenants, lessees,
employees, occupants of the premises or agent thereof, that such violation
shall cease immediately upon notice.
§ 89-7. Violations and penalties.
Any person, including but not limited to tenants, lessees, employees,
occupants or agents and any person who knowingly commits, participates

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 114-18. Identification.
§ 114-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Homestead Borough
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Homestead Borough and declared
to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
§ 114-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 114-19
1:113
§ 114-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 114-23B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 114-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Homestead and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 114-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH,
drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes.

ARTICLE V
Technical Provisions
§ 114-23. General.
§ 114-24. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified by the applicant prior
to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map

placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the placarding
action were based have been eliminated.

B. After such hearing, the governing body or hearing officer shall sustain,
modify or withdraw the notice. If the governing body or hearing officer
sustains or modifies such notice, it shall be deemed to be an order. Any

of this chapter have been complied with, the Enforcement Officer shall
continue such order in effect, or modify or revoke it. The costs of such
emergency repair, vacation or demolition of such dangerous building shall

interest in the dangerous building fails to comply with the order of the
Enforcement Officer within the time specified in the notice issued by
him and no petition for a hearing is filed within 10 days thereafter, or
following a hearing by the governing body or hearing officer where the
order is sustained thereby, the Enforcement Officer shall cause such

General Provisions
[Adopted 5-13-2010 by Ord. No. 1208]
§ 118A-1. Findings.
The Council finds as follows:
§ 118A-2. Terms defined.
§ 118A-3. Boarding of vacant buildings.
A. When the owner of a vacant building fails to actively maintain and
manage the building, the building can become a major cause of blight in
both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods. Vacant buildings
that are boarded, substandard or unkempt properties, and long-term
vacancies discourage economic development and retard appreciation of
property values.
B. It is the responsibility of property ownership to prevent owned property
from becoming a burden to the neighborhood and community and a
threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.
C. One vacant property that is not actively and well maintained and
managed can be the core and cause of spreading blight.
D. Owners of multiple buildings, either concurrently or serially, that are
vacant and a blight to the community are a significant problem in the
Borough. Owners of multiple buildings who fail to correct deficiencies
and blight conditions contribute to the decline of neighborhoods to a
greater extent than owners who own only one building. Some owners
have acquired multiple vacant and blighted buildings at depressed
prices and have not improved or cared for the properties. It is in the
interest of the welfare of neighborhoods that owners of multiple
properties who fail to maintain properties and correct vacant and
blighted buildings are subject to imposition of higher administrative
penalties in order to encourage these owners to correct violations of
this chapter in a prompt manner.
A. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "vacant building" means a
building that is unoccupied, or occupied by unauthorized persons, for
any amount of time.
A. For the purposes of this chapter, "boarded" shall mean the covering of
all entry points, including all doors and windows, with plywood or other
materials for the purpose of preventing entry into the building by
persons or animals.
B. Vacant buildings shall be boarded so that the building can no longer be
secured against intrusion by the closing and locking of doors and
windows.
§ 118A-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 118A-3
1:147
§ 118A-4. Exceptions.
No owner shall allow a building designed for human use or occupancy to be
a vacant building for more than 30 days, unless one of the following applies:
§ 118A-5. Maintenance and monitoring of vacant buildings.
Active maintenance and monitoring shall include all of the following:
§ 118A-6. Violations and penalties.
C. Vacant buildings that are immediately dangerous and are open and
accessible to the general public may be summarily boarded by the
Borough, and a lien may be placed against the property.
D. Any building that is boarded, whether by voluntary action of the owner
or as a result of enforcement actively by the Borough, shall be boarded
in compliance with Borough standards promulgated by the Borough
Manager or Code Enforcement Officer.
A. The building is the subject of an active building permit for repair or
rehabilitation and the owner is progressing diligently to complete the
repair or rehabilitation.
B. The building meets all codes, does not contribute to blight, is ready for
occupancy, and is:
(1) Actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; or
(2) Actively being maintained and monitored by the owner, as defined
in § 118A-5.
A. Maintenance of landscaping and plant materials in good condition.
B. Maintenance of the exterior of the building, including but not limited to
paint and finishes, in good condition.
C. Regular removal of all exterior trash, debris and graffiti.
D. Maintenance of the building in continuing compliance with all
applicable codes and regulations.
E. Prevention of criminal activity on the premises, including but not
limited to the use and sale of controlled substances, prostitution and
criminal street gang activity.
F. The posting of a notice in a conspicuous place on the front of the
building stating the name, address, and telephone number of both the
owner and, if applicable, the owner's agent in control of the building.
This notice shall have lettering not less than two inches high and shall
be generally readable from at least 30 feet away.
§ 118A-3 HOMESTEAD CODE § 118A-6
1:148
§ 118A-7. Monitoring fee for vacant nuisance properties.
Any vacant building that also constitutes a public nuisance as defined in
this chapter shall be subject to monthly monitoring fees and enforcement
response fees to recover the Borough's regulatory costs to monitor and
respond to the vacant building. The separate monthly monitoring fee and
enforcement response fee shall be set by resolution of the Borough Council.
The monitoring fee shall be applicable even in the absence of any action,
administrative or otherwise, by the Borough pursuant to any other provision
of the Borough Code. The monitoring fee shall be imposed upon the initial
determination that the vacant building constitutes a public nuisance as
defined in this chapter. The fee shall thereafter be imposed in each thirtyday
period following the imposition of the initial monitoring fee. On
buildings requiring more than one involuntary Borough enforcement
response within any thirty-day period, an additional and separate
enforcement response fee shall be imposed, for each response, upon the
owner. Monitoring fees shall be imposed as long as the vacant building
remains a public nuisance as defined in applicable provisions of the
Borough Code.
A. Any owner of a building that is in violation of this chapter shall be
subject to a penalty, in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per building, for
the first violation.
B. A second penalty shall be imposed upon an owner pursuant to this
chapter if the owner's building remains in violation of this chapter 30
days following the imposition of the first administrative penalty.
Additional penalties may be imposed each thirty-day period following
the imposition of a penalty under this chapter. Additional penalties may
be imposed so long as the violations continue. A second and any
subsequent penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed $5,000.
C. If a previous penalty has been imposed pursuant to this chapter upon an
owner within two years of the date of the imposition of the present
penalty, and that previous penalty related to a vacant building other
than the building presently the subject of a penalty, any penalty
imposed shall be imposed pursuant to this chapter but in no case shall
be less than $2,000 not more than $10,000.

grading, excavations and fills. Changes, additions or alterations made
to existing excavations or fills shall conform to the provisions of these
regulations. A separate grading permit shall be required for each site.
§ 147-2 HOMESTEAD CODE § 147-3
1:184
§ 147-4. Exceptions.
A grading permit will not be required for any of the following situations:
One permit may cover the grading, excavation and any fills made on the
same site.
B. Only one permit is required for a continuous parcel to be graded for a
proposed major planned development, such as a residential planned
unit development or a planned industrial park, when adequate
standards or requirements for grading the parcel are approved by the
Administrator.
A. Grading which is limited to mining, quarrying or stockpiling of coal,
rock, sand, aggregate or clay that satisfies requirements of regulations
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. Grading which is limited to solid waste disposal areas or sanitary
landfills operated in accordance with the requirements, rules and
ordinances adopted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and the Allegheny County Department of Health.

result in a cut and/or fill slope steeper than four horizontal to one
vertical and does not exceed an area of 1,000 square feet for areas
recognized by the soil survey or better source as containing landslideprone
soils. Better sources recognizing landslide-prone soil areas may
be the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey, a
professional engineer experienced in geology or an engineering
geologist.
D. Excavation which does not exceed 10 feet in vertical depth, does not
result in a cut or fill slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical
and does not exceed an area of 5,000 square feet in areas of soils not
recognized by the soil survey or better as landslide-prone.

F. If the fill does not exceed 10 feet in vertical depth at its deepest point
measured from the top of such fill to the natural ground surface, if the
area of fill does not exceed 5,000 square feet and if the slope of fill is not
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
G. Grading which does not exceed new construction authorized by a
building permit properly issued by the governing body. Grading under
the authorization of a building permit should follow the standards and
requirements of this chapter.
H. Soil excavated under the authorization of a building permit properly
issued by the governing body, which is temporarily stockpiled on the
same site as the excavation; provided, however, that if the material from
such excavation is thereafter to be used for fill purposes for which a

grading permit is required, such permit must be obtained prior to such
use in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. In addition, if
excavated material is stockpiled on a site for a period of longer than
120 days, then a permit shall be necessary when disposing of the fill
material.
A. Whenever the governing body, upon the recommendation of its
Administrator, determines that any existing excavation, embankment or
fill has become a hazard as defined in § 147-2, the owner of the property
upon which the excavation, embankment or fill is located, or other
person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt of notice, in
writing, from the Administrator shall, within the reasonable period
specified therein, repair, reconstruct or remove such excavation
embankment or fill so as to eliminate the hazard.
B. If, after such notification, the property owner has not made the
necessary repairs within the time adopted, then the governing body
may direct government employees to make the required repairs, and
the cost thereof shall be borne by the property owner by a lien filed as
provided by law.
A. Every applicant for a grading permit shall file a written application
therefor with the Administrator in a form prescribed by the
Administrator. Such application shall:
(1) Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot,
block, tract or street address, or similar description which will
readily identify and definitely locate the proposed work.
(2) Be accompanied by plans and specifications prepared, signed and
sealed by a professional engineer, surveyor or architect giving a
reasonable picture of the site and proposed soil erosion controls, if
any. The Administrator may waive the preparation or approval and
signature by the professional engineer, surveyor or architect only
when it is self-evident that the proposed work is simple, clearly
shown on the plans submitted, creates no potential nuisance to
adjacent property or hazard and does not include the construction
of a fill upon which a structure may be erected. Such plans may
include a description of the site proposed for grading, accurate
location by lot, block, tract, street address, longitude and latitude,
coordinates, a location map or other similar information, a contour
map showing the present contours of the land and the proposed
contours of the land after completion of the proposed grading and a

Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant shall post a bond,
corporate surety or other approved security in the amount of 10% of the
estimated cost of the grading work and erosion control facilities proposed
for the permit to guarantee said work and facilities in a satisfactory manner
and to meet the requirements of this chapter. No bond shall be required if
another bond or other approved security is posted for construction and/or
site improvements. When all requirements of this permit have been met and
the work has been completed in a satisfactory manner, the full amount of
security shall be returned to the person posting said security.
utilities and waterways. In addition, plans may include a
description of the type and classification of the soil from the soil
survey or better; details and location of any proposed drainage
structures and pipes, walls and cribbing; seeding locations and
schedules; debris basins; diversion channels; nature of fill material
and such other information as the Administrator may need to carry
out the purposes of this chapter. All plans shall be dated and bear
the name and seal of the professional engineer who prepared the
same and the names of the applicant and the owner of the land.
Plans shall be submitted in triplicate, one set of which shall be of
reproducible nature.
(3) State the estimated dates for the starting and completion of
grading work.
(4) State the purpose for which the grading application is filed.
B. The duty of the Administrator shall be to obtain information and reports
from governmental agencies and scientific and/or engineering journals,
if available, and professional engineers and/or engineering geologists,
if necessary. This information and these reports must be of sufficient
detail to ensure that proposed grading will not create a hazard and that
there will be a minimum of soil erosion on the site to be graded.
C. To be adequate, a geological report may include a detailed description
of the geological conditions of the site and may include conclusions and
recommendations that will demonstrate the relationship of the
geological conditions to the proposed development, including
hazardous conditions, water resources, mineral resources and
environmental impact. A soil conservation report may include existing
site description as to topography, drainage, cover and soils, major
resource problems as to soil limitations, erosion and sediment potential
and surface runoff changes and recommendations to minimize soil
limitations, erosion and sediment and surface water disposal problems.
D. In no case shall the Administrator require more than minimum
adequate standards, as recommended by governmental agencies,
professional engineers or engineering geologists and other
requirements specified in this chapter, for issuing a grading permit.
§ 147-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-8
1:187
§ 147-8. Expiration of permit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within
one year or is not completed within three years from the date of issue,
provided that the governing body, acting upon the recommendation of
the Administrator, may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence
that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed
within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time; and,
provided, further, that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit. Any physical changes in the site
such as surface water drainage, soil and bedrock dislocations, alteration
of groundwater discharge or any other natural or man-made modifications
which would cause a doubt to be cast upon the feasibility of the contents of
the original permit approval must be reported to the Administrator in the
intervening period between approval of the permit and completion of the
project.
§ 147-9. Denial of permit; appeal.
§ 147-10. Grading inspection and supervision.
A. When the requirements of this chapter for obtaining a permit have been
met, the Administrator shall approve the proposed plan and grant a
grading permit to the applicant. Approved work may then start.
However, when, in the opinion of the Administrator, work proposed by
the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person, or any street
or alley, or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall be
denied. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger
property of streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the
Administrator shall give due consideration to possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface
conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, aquifers,
springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
B. The governing body shall consider within 15 days appeals from the
provisions of these regulations or from the denial by the Administrator,
and the governing body within 15 days shall consider alternate
methods, standards or materials proposed by the developer when in his
opinion strict compliance with the provisions of these regulations is
unnecessary. Any applicant or permit holder shall have the right to
appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction from any decision of the
governing body.
A. The permittee or his agent shall notify the Administrator, in writing, of
the start and completion of each continuous grading operation. Notice
shall be received by the Administrator or at his office at least two
working days before the start or completion of grading operations.
§ 147-8 HOMESTEAD CODE § 147-10
1:188
§ 147-11. Standards for excavation.
B. Grading work at these stages or at any other time will be subject to spot
inspections at the discretion of the Administrator to determine that the
work is being performed in compliance with these regulations.
C. In special cases, when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil as
recognized by the soil survey or better, the Administrator may require
special precautions from the grader. The results of all soil tests and core
borings made relating to the site graded shall be submitted to the
Administrator.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut should be three horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazard. However, a
governmental review agency, professional engineer or engineering
geologist may recognize the types of soil on the site to be graded from
the soil survey or better. Maximum slopes can then be determined as
follows:
(1) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are greater than 25% shall have
cut slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. Soil
survey map symbols are:
34-DE-6 34-E-2 34-F-1 65-E-2
(2) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall have cut
slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical. Soil survey
map symbols are:
32-B-2 34-C-2 65-C-2 67-C-2
32-C-2 34-D-2 65-D-2 67-D-2
34-B-2 65-B-2 67-B-1
(3) Soils which are not or have a low probability of being landslideprone
shall have a slope no steeper than 1 1/2 horizontal to one
vertical. All soil survey map symbols except the symbols listed
above donate soils of low landslide probability.
B. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a grading permit, provided that one or both of the following is
satisfied:
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for
recognized soil conditions on the site. A written statement, signed
and sealed by a professional engineer, stating that the steeper
slope will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a hazard
will be slight, must be submitted to the Administrator.
§ 147-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-11
1:189
§ 147-12. Standards for fills.
§ 147-13. Standards for minimizing erosion and sediment.
Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, should be
followed. One or a combination of guidelines should be used to minimize
hazards, depending on site conditions and proposed grading. However,
the Administrator may approve grading plans not meeting guidelines of
the Handbook if the proposed grading will not constitute a hazard.
Governmental and/or engineering reports should be used as evidence that
proposed grading will not constitute a hazard.
§ 147-14. Retaining walls.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a
professional engineer and approved by the Administrator, is
provided to support the face of excavation.
C. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall generally be set back from
adjacent property lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit
the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting
property or street.
D. Guidelines for cuts in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, should be followed. One or a
combination of guidelines should be used to minimize hazards
depending on site conditions and proposed grading.
A. No fill should be placed over trees, stumps or other material which
could create a hazard. Instead, such materials may be buried in natural
ground where no structures will be built or a hazard created. Limbs can
be chipped and mixed with the topsoil.
B. All fills should be compacted to provide stability of fill material and to
prevent undesirable settlement or slippage.
C. Clean soil or earth should be placed over the top and exposed surfaces
of the fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all materials used in the fill
other than clean soil or earth. If the filling operation is intermittent, the
top and exposed surfaces of the fill should be so covered at the
completion of each lift.
D. The top or bottom edge of slopes should generally be set back from
adjacent property lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit
the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting
property or street.
E. Guidelines for fills in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, should be followed. One or a
combination of guidelines should be used to minimize hazards,
depending on site conditions and proposed grading.

§ 147-15. Drainage.
A. Definition of "retaining wall": a structure composed of concrete, steel or
other approved building material constructed for the purpose of
supporting a cut or filled embankment which would otherwise not
comply with the requirements of the standards set forth in this chapter
and which is more than four feet in height as measured on the exposed
vertical surface of the wall.
B. If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this
chapter, a building permit, as provided for by other municipal
regulations, shall not be required. The grading permit will apply to the
retaining wall, and the requirements for inspection, etc., as stated
herein, will be complied with.
C. Retaining walls must be constructed in accordance with sound
engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall bear the
seal of a professional engineer.
D. The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of subterranean
drainage facilities shall be done strictly in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and the appropriate municipal specifications.
E. In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face
of the wall shall be three feet zero inches back from the adjoining
property.
(1) A special exception to this requirement may be applied for and
granted by the Administrator if it can be satisfactorily
demonstrated that such a variance is necessary to ensure normal
use of the property, i.e., for a sideline driveway.
(2) The requirement of this subsection may also be set aside when the
proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent
property owners, and appropriate documents so stating are filed
with the application for the permit.
A. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface or subsurface
waters from damaging:
(1) The cut face of an excavation.
(2) The sloping surface of a fill.
(3) Adjacent property affected by the change in the existing natural
runoff pattern.
B. To prevent damage, grading plans should follow Vegetative Control
Methods and Ditch and Conduit Control Methods in the Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, when
they fit the site. The Administrator may approve methods and materials
recommended by governmental agencies and professional engineers
when they are more suitable to the site in preventing damage. Drainage

shall maintain in good condition and repair the excavation or fill
permitted, and also all retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures,
fences, ground cover and any other protective devices as may be a part
of the permit requirements.
B. If, at any time subsequent to the completion of the grading work, the
cut face or fill slope shall evidence signs of deterioration, erosion or
other evidence which might be detrimental to the properties above and
below the grading site, the Council, upon the recommendation of its
Administrator, may direct the property owner to take necessary
remedial steps in accordance with sound engineering practice to
restore the grading to a safe condition, and do so in a reasonable period
of time.
A. No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair or maintain any
grading, excavation or fill, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or
in violation of any provision of this chapter.
B. When written notice of any of the provisions of this chapter has been
served by the Administrator on any person, such violation shall be
discontinued immediately or within a reasonable time limit specified in
such notice. If the violation is not discontinued, or extends beyond the
specified time limit, the Administrator shall revoke the grading permit
and the violation is subject to fine.
C. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable
on conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding $100 per day for each
and every offense. Whenever such person shall have been notified by
the Administrator by service of summons in a prosecution or in any
other way that he is committing such violation of this chapter, each day
that he shall continue such violation after such notification shall
constitute a separate offense punishable by a like fine or penalty. Such
fines or penalties shall be collected as like fines or penalties are now by
law collected.

(2) Prior to the designation of any Local Historic District, the Historical
Architectural Review Board shall submit to the Borough Council a
report and recommendation on the historical and architectural
significance of the site or area to be designated. Such report shall
also attempt to provide an indication of the economic status of the
property or properties under consideration for designation,

maintenance to building exteriors, such as repainting, provided such
repair and maintenance activity does not include any change in color or
any structural alterations.
§ 153-3 HOMESTEAD CODE § 153-5
1:204
§ 153-6. Criteria for review.
The recommendation and decision on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness shall be based on the following standards as is applicable
to the particular activity and/or use of the property and the buildings
thereon:
C. Application requirements. Applications for certificates of
appropriateness required by this section shall be made to the Zoning
Officer on forms provided, together with architectural sketches,
elevations and other information described on the application form.
D. Notice of public meetings. Prior to considering any application for a
certificate of appropriateness required by this section, the Historical
Architectural Review Board shall provide public notice of the date, time
and location of the public meeting at which the Board shall consider the
application for any such certificate. Such notice shall appear at least
one time in a newspaper having general circulation in the Borough, and
shall appear no less than seven days prior to the date of such public
meeting.
E. Recommendation by the Historical Architectural Review Board. Within
30 days after the public meeting to consider the application for a

and specifications are necessary to meet the conditions for
protecting:
(a) The distinctive historical character of the district; and
(b) The architectural integrity of the building or structure.
§ 153-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-6
1:205
A. Standards for new construction. New construction in the Local Historic
District will be certified as appropriate if it is compatible with the scale
and basic design elements of adjacent and neighboring buildings which
are classified as significant and contributing and with distinguishing
site design elements of the district. The intent is not to require or
encourage new buildings to look like old buildings, but to assure
pleasing and harmonious relationships between old and new that will
maintain and strengthen the architectural character of the historic
district. The following design elements shall be considered in the
evaluation of the appropriateness of new construction:
(1) Building height. New buildings should be constructed to a
maximum height that is within 10% of the average height of
neighboring buildings.
(2) Elevation proportion. The relationship between the height and
width of the front elevation of a new building should be within 10%
of the average proportions of adjacent buildings.
(3) Proportion of openings. The relationship of height to width of
windows and doors of a building should be within 10% of the
proportions of windows and doors of adjacent buildings.
(4) Spacing of windows and doors. The spacing of windows and doors
in the front facade of a building should be similar to adjacent
buildings.
(5) Horizontal lines. Header and sill lines of a building should be
located at similar heights or elevation as the horizontal lines of
adjacent buildings.
(6) Spacing of buildings on street. Setbacks and side yards of new
buildings should be similar to those on adjacent parcels. Placement
of sidewalks and projection of porches should be similar to adjacent
buildings.
(7) Roofs. The shape, style and material of the roof of a new building
should be similar to the roofs of adjacent and surrounding
buildings.
(8) Building materials. Building materials should be compatible with
materials commonly used within the historic district.
(9) Color. The predominant color of a building and the color of its trim
should be compatible with the colors of surrounding buildings.
(10) Architectural details. The use of specific architectural elements
and details such as porches, dormers, cornices, brackets, quoins,
balustrades and the like may be used to strengthen the relationship
of new construction to the existing architecture of the district.
However, such detailing is not sufficient to assure appropriateness
§ 153-6 HOMESTEAD CODE § 153-6
1:206
if the structure is not related to its surroundings in terms of
massing, rhythm and proportions.
(11) Landscaping. The use of plant materials that are traditional in the
district should be encouraged. Similarly encouraged is the use of
paving and fence materials that are traditional in the district.
B. Standards for rehabilitation. Except as provided in Subsection C below,
the following "standards for rehabilitation" shall be used by the
Historical Architectural Review Board when determining if a
rehabilitation project is appropriate. These standards are a section of
the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for Historic Preservation
Projects," and appear in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 1208 (formerly 36 CFR Part 67).
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be
based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
§ 153-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-6
1:207
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
(10) Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
C. Standards for additions to noncontributing structures. The
appropriateness of additions to noncontributing structures in local
historic districts shall be judged primarily in terms of their visual
impact on nearby properties. Additions should generally be certified as
appropriate if their size is minor in relation to the total structure and if
they do not significantly increase the visual appearance of
incompatibility between the noncontributing structure and neighboring
structures which are contributing or significant.
D. Standards for signs. All signs within the Local Historic District shall
comply with the sign regulations which are applicable in the underlying
zoning district, unless excepted under the provisions of the subsections
hereunder, and with the additional special standards for signs
contained elsewhere in the Borough's Zoning Ordinance.39
(1) A sign which meets the requirements of the applicable district must
still be certified as appropriate in relation to the specific building
on which it is to be located and in terms of compatibility with signs
in the surrounding area; compliance with the applicable zoning
district requirements does not guarantee approval of a certificate
of appropriateness.
(2) The Historical Architectural Review Board may recommend and the
Borough Council may issue a certificate of appropriateness for a
sign which is not permitted by the regulations of the applicable
zoning district if the proposed sign is shown to be historically
accurate by documentation acceptable to the HARB.
E. Standards for demolition or relocation of structures.
39.Editor's Note: See Ch. 260, Zoning.
§ 153-6 HOMESTEAD CODE § 153-6
1:208
§ 153-7. Demolition by neglect.
§ 153-8. Enforcement.
(1) In the case of a building to be razed, demolished, or moved, the
Historical Architectural Review Board and the Borough Council
shall consider:
(a) The extent to which the loss of the building will detract from
that local historic district and the purposes of this section; and
(b) The public benefit to be gained by preserving the building or
district in comparison to any loss or hardship to be suffered by
the property owner.
(2) If the initial recommendation of the Review Board is against the
proposed demolition, a period of 90 days shall be provided during
which the Review Board shall attempt to negotiate with the
applicant in order to achieve an acceptable alternative to the
proposed demolition. If agreement is not reached by the end of the
ninety-day period, the Review Board shall transmit its negative
recommendation to the Borough Council, which shall issue or deny
a certificate of appropriateness based on its consideration of all of
the information presented. If the Borough Council authorizes
issuance of a permit for demolition after a negative
recommendation from the Review Board, a permit shall not be
issued for 10 days, during which time the Historical Architectural
Review Board may request, and the Borough Council may order,
that issuance of a permit be delayed for an additional 90 days in
order to allow documentation of the resource prior to its
destruction.
A. Condition. No person owning any building or structure within the Local
Historic District shall permit or cause such building or structure to
suffer demolition by neglect.
B. Definition. "Demolition by neglect" exists where there is:
(1) Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports, roofs or
other horizontal members, and external chimneys, such that the
structural integrity of the building may be threatened or
compromised;
(2) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and foundations
causing or contributing to the deterioration specified in Subsection
B(1) above;
(3) Significant rotting and other forms of decay; or
(4) Creation of any hazardous or unsafe condition or conditions.

Licensing — See Ch. 169.
§ 190-1. Statement of purpose.
§ 190-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter the following words have the meaning indicated:
CANVASSER — A person who attempts to make personal contact with
a resident at his/her residence without prior specific invitation or
appointment from the resident for the primary purpose of: 1) attempting
to enlist support for or against a particular religion, philosophy, ideology,
political party, issue or candidate, even if incidental to such purpose the
canvasser accepts the donation of money for or against such cause; or
2) distributing a handbill or flyer advertising a noncommercial event or
service.
A. The Borough Council of Homestead Borough finds that many citizens of
this community expect the Borough to assist them in preserving their
privacy, avoiding becoming the victims of theft, fraud or harassment
and avoiding petty annoyances that disrupt the quiet enjoyment of their
homes. However, other persons often desire to interrupt the quiet
enjoyment of one's home without the intent to engage in harassment,
theft or fraud but instead for the purpose of soliciting donations for
various causes, or to canvas for support for particular religious,
ideological, or political causes, or for reasons of prompting commerce.
B. An important part of the freedom enjoyed by all citizens and residents
of the United States is the right to speak freely, to express ideas that
may be unpopular, and to engage others in debate without government
interference. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently
recognized another interest of citizens and residents of the United
States, which is the right to be protected by local government from
theft, fraud and harassment, particularly when solicitation of money is
involved.
C. It is the responsibility of all units of government, including Homestead
Borough, to balance these competing interests in a manner consistent
with the Constitution of the United States and consistent with the
Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, while attempting to
minimize fraud, theft and other crimes, and protect the privacy of our
citizens.
§ 186-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-2
1:255
HAWKER or PEDDLER — A person who attempts to make personal contact
with a resident at his/her residence without prior specific invitation or
appointment from the resident for the primary purpose of attempting to
sell a good or service. A "hawker" or "peddler" does not include a person
who distributes handbills or flyers for a commercial purpose, advertising an
event, activity, good or service that is offered to the resident for purchase
at a location away from the residence or at a time different from the time of
visit. Such a person is a "solicitor"
SOLICITOR — A person who attempts to make personal contact with a
resident at his/her residence without prior specific invitation or
appointment from the resident for the primary purpose of: 1) attempting
to obtain a donation to a particular patriotic, philanthropic, social service,
welfare, benevolent, educational, civic, fraternal, charitable, political or
religious purpose, even if incidental to such purpose there is the sale of
some good or service; or 2) distributing a handbill or flyer advertising a
commercial event or service.
§ 190-3. Registration required for hawkers, peddlers and solicitors;
available for canvassers.
No person shall act as a hawker, peddler or as a solicitor within the Borough
without first registering with the Borough Secretary in accordance with this
chapter. A canvasser is not required to register but any canvasser may do
so for the purpose of reassuring Borough residents of the canvasser's good
faith.
§ 190-4. Fees.
This chapter does not set fees for registration. Fees for registration shall be
the amount(s) adopted and revised from time to time by Borough Council
in its annual fee resolution under the section of the annual fee resolution
captioned: "Vending, Solicitation and Peddling License" or "Vending,
Solicitation and Peddling Registration." The term "license" whenever used
in the annual fee resolution shall be considered for the purpose of this
chapter to be synonymous with and to have the same meaning as
"registration." Where a canvasser voluntarily elects to register but is not
required by this chapter to do so, there is no filing fee for the registration.
§ 190-5. Contents of registration.
Any person or organization required to register under this chapter shall
provide the following information:
A. The name, physical description and photograph of each person required
to register. In lieu of this information, a driver's license, state
identification card, passport, or other government-issued identification
card (issued by a government within the United States) containing this
information may be provided and a photocopy taken.
§ 190-2 HOMESTEAD CODE § 190-5
1:256
§ 190-6. No-visit list.
The Borough Secretary shall maintain a list of persons within the Borough
who restrict visits to their residential property (including their leasehold,
in the case of a tenant) by hawkers, peddlers, solicitors, and canvassers.
A copy of the no-visit list shall be provided by the Borough Secretary to
each hawker, peddler, solicitor, or canvasser upon request. It shall be the
responsibility of all hawkers, peddlers, solicitors and canvassers to insure
that they have obtained or been provided with a copy of the most current
no-visit list and to ensure their compliance therewith.
§ 190-7. Distribution of handbills and commercial flyers.
In addition to the other regulations contained herein, a solicitor or
canvasser leaving handbills or commercial flyers about the community shall
observe the following regulations:
B. The permanent and (if any) local address of the organization or
business to be represented by a hawker, peddler, solicitor or canvasser.
C. The permanent and (if any) local address of each person acting as a
hawker, peddler, solicitor or canvasser.

event, activity, good or service (i.e.. the peddler's principal).
(2) A copy of the principal's sales tax license as issued by the
commonwealth, if applicable.
H. The web address for this organization, person, or group (or other
address) where residents having subsequent questions can go for more
information.
A. No handbill or flyer shall be left at or attached to any sign, utility pole,
or other structure within the public right-of-way.
B. No handbill or flyer shall be left at or attached to any privately owned
property in a manner that causes damage to such privately owned
property.
§ 190-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-7
1:257
§ 190-8. General prohibitions.
C. No handbill or flyer shall be left at, or attached to any property: 1) listed
on the Borough no-visit list; or 2) having a "no solicitor" sign of the type
described herein.
D. Any person observed distributing handbills or flyers shall be required to
identify himself/herself to the police. This is for the purpose of knowing
the likely identity of the perpetrator if the Borough receives a complaint
of damage caused to private property during the distribution of
handbills or flyers.
A. No hawker, peddler, solicitor or canvasser shall:
(1) Enter upon any private property where the property is clearly
posted in the front yard a sign visible from the right-of-way (public
or private) indicating a prohibition against peddling, soliciting and/
or canvassing. Such sign need not exceed one square foot in size
and may contain words such as "no soliciting" or "no solicitors" in
letters of at least two inches in height. The phrase "no soliciting" or
"no solicitors" shall also prohibit hawkers, peddlers and
canvassers.
(2) Remain upon any private property where a notice in the form of a
sign or sticker is placed upon any door or entrance way leading into
the residence or dwelling at which guests would normally enter,
which sign contains the words "no soliciting" or "no solicitors" and
which is clearly visible to the hawker, peddler, solicitor or
canvasser.
(3) Enter upon any private property where the current occupant has
posted the property on the Borough's no-visit list (except where the
posting form indicates the occupant has given permission for this
type of visit), regardless of whether a front yard sign is posted.
(4) Use or attempt to use any entrance other than the front or main
entrance to the dwelling, or step from the sidewalk or indicated
walkway (where one exists) leading from the right-of-way to the
front or main entrance, except by express invitation of the resident
or occupant of the property.
(5) Remove any yard sign, door or entrance sign that gives notice to
such person that the resident or occupant does not invite visitors.
(6) Canvass, solicit, hawk or peddle between the hours of 9:00 p.m.

the resident or occupant of a dwelling allowing him/her to enter upon
any posted property.

subject to demolition or removal without further notice. Any person
directly affected by a decision of the code official or a notice or order
issued under this code pursuant to which a structure is condemned so
that it is subject to the possibility of being demolished and removed
without further notice shall have a right to appeal to the demolition
hearing officer appointed by the Borough Council, provided that a
written application for appeal is filed within 10 days after the day the
decision, notice or order was served. The written application for
appeal shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor and
the address to which all correspondence regarding the matter can be
sent to the applicant, by standard United States Mail. The application
for appeal must be received within the aforementioned 10 days by the
Homestead Borough Secretary at the Borough of Homestead
Municipal Building, 221 E. Seventh Avenue, Homestead, PA 15120.
The Homestead Borough Secretary shall thereupon send by mail, to
the address provided in the application for appeal, notice of the time,
place and location of the hearing at which the applicant will be given
the opportunity to present evidence and testimony to show cause why
the code official's decision relating to the structure(s) should be
modified or withdrawn. Alternatively, the time place and location of
the hearing may be set forth in the notice and/or order issued by the
code official. Failure to file an appeal within the aforementioned 10
days will result in the decision of the code official or notice or order
issued under this code to be a final order.
113.2. Demolition hearing officer's decision. After the hearing is
concluded, the demolition hearing officer shall issue and mail to the
applicant a written decision granting or denying, in whole or in part,
the applicant's appeal and the written decision shall constitute a final
order.

type set forth in Section 113.1 above, and the appeal process set forth
in Section 111 shall not apply.

being serviced and not on the street in front of the property. No
construction dumpster or POD shall be located within 10 feet of an
abutting building. Where compliance with this provision is not
possible by virtue of the proximity of the buildings to one another,
or where other compelling reasons (example: narrowness of street
prevents delivery of dumpster onto property), on-street placement
is permitted.
(2) On street. If permitted and the construction dumpster or POD is
placed on the public street or alley, the dumpster shall be directly
in front of the property address utilizing the dumpster. Additionally,
a dumpster or POD placed in the street shall:
(a) Not be more than 18 inches from the curb.
§ 199-2 HOMESTEAD CODE § 199-6

roadway does not allow for the safe passage of motor vehicles
around it.
B. Time limit.
(1) A dumpster or POD placed on a public street may not remain for
longer than 21 days at any one time and, absent an emergency
condition, not more than on three separate occasions in one twelvemonth
period.
(2) A dumpster or POD placed off-street may remain for 30 days, and,
absent an emergency condition, not more than on three separate
occasions in one twelve-month period.
(3) When the need for the dumpster or POD is the result of an
emergency condition at the property to be served (example: water

A. It is the purpose of this chapter and the policy of the Council of the
Borough of Homestead, in order to protect and promote the public
health, safety and welfare of its citizens, to establish rights and
obligations of owners and occupants relating to the rental of certain
dwelling units in the Borough of Homestead and to encourage owners
and occupants to maintain and improve the quality of rental housing
within the community. It is also the policy of the Borough that owners,
managers and occupants share responsibilities to obey the various
codes adopted to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare.
As means to those ends, this chapter provides for a system of
inspections, issuance and renewal of occupancy license, and sets
penalties for violations.
B. This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its
purposes and policies.
C. In considering the adoption of this chapter, the Borough of Homestead
makes the following findings:
(1) There is a greater incidence of violations of various codes of the
Borough at residential properties where owners of rental property
do not reside on the property than at owner-occupied residential
properties or family-occupied residential rental properties.
(2) There is a greater incidence of problems with the maintenance and
upkeep of residential properties where owners do not reside on the
property than at owner-occupied residential properties or familyoccupied
residential rental properties.

the peace and quiet of the neighborhood at residential properties
where owners do not reside on the property than at owneroccupied
residential properties or family-occupied residential
rental properties.

units, and the high rate of turnover both results from and
contributes to the problems described in the preceding

constitute a nuisance.
B. In forming their opinion as to the acceptability of these waters, the
Borough, or its designated agent, will give consideration to such factors
as to the qualities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the
sewage treatment process, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant,
degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, degree
of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors.
C. In all cases, the Borough, or its designated agent, shall require
compliance by the user with all aspects of latest applicable ALCOSAN
pretreatment standards.
D. See provision Part 4, ALCOSAN pretreatment standards.
(1) Plumbing to be in good repair. Every building or room occupied or
used as a food preparation facility or restaurant shall be well
drained. All soil pipes, waste pipes, drains or other plumbing
fixtures shall be of adequate size to enable the passage of any
waste intended to pass through it to the main public sewer. All
drains, sewers, waste and soil pipes, traps and water in gas pipes
shall, at all times, be kept in good repair and order so that no gases
or odor shall escape therefrom and so that the same shall not leak,
and all vent pipes shall be kept in good order and repair and free
from obstruction.
(2) Installation of grease interceptors and grease traps.
§ 212-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-51
1:343
(a) Every building, room or space or part thereof used as a food
preparation facility or restaurant, whether new or existing,
shall install or cause to be installed, if not already installed, a
grease interceptor or grease trap. The type of installation shall
be determined by the total fixture flow-through rate of
potential grease-laden fixtures discharging through the
building sewage lines as determined by the Allegheny County
Health Department (ACHD) Plumbing Division. For flowthrough
rates of 35 gpm or less, an internal grease trap may be
installed in certain existing structures used as food
preparation facilities and restaurants. For flow-through rates
exceeding 35 gpm, an external, underground grease
interceptor must be installed in all new structures, major
remodeling or renovation of existing structures, or changes of
use involving food preparation facilities or restaurants.
(b) Said grease trap or grease interceptor shall be installed at an
appropriate location along the sewer line between the food
preparation facility or restaurant and the line's entry in the
main public newline. An inspection site tee shall be installed
between the interceptor discharge and connect to the public
sewer system. All installation shall be in accordance with the
ACHD Plumbing Code and Regulations. No solid waste devices,
such as waste grinders, disposals, potato peelers, etc., shall
discharge through the grease trap or grease interceptor. Only
potential grease-laden fixtures may discharge through the trap
or interceptor.
(c) All new food preparation facilities and restaurants shall be
required to install an exterior, underground grease interceptor
of a minimum one-thousand-gallon capacity, regardless of the
flow-through rate.
(d) In all existing food preparation facilities and restaurants there
shall be installed a grease interceptor or grease trap as
determined by the flow-through rate, as detailed above, if not
already installed. In existing facilities where it is determined
by the Borough that a grease trap is not sufficient, the Borough
may require that grease interceptors (as detailed above) be
installed. Such insufficiency shall be evidenced by excessive
amounts of grease being discharged into the public sewer
system by a facility. All existing food preparation facilities and
restaurants shall, at a change of ownership or remodeling or
renovation thereof, install an exterior, underground grease
interceptor of a minimum one-thousand-gallon capacity. In all
existing structures, buildings or parts thereof in which there is
a change of use or occupancy or that of a food preparation
facility or restaurant there shall be installed a grease
interceptor of a minimum one-thousand-gallon capacity,
regardless of the flow-through rate.
§ 212-51 HOMESTEAD CODE § 212-51
1:344
(e) All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Wastewater Superintendent and shall be located under cover
and so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Interceptors shall not be located so as to receive
rainwater or unpolluted runoff.
(f) Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes
in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction,
watertight and equipped with easily removable covers which,
when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight.
(3) Maintenance of grease interceptors and grease traps.
(a) All grease interceptors and grease traps shall be maintained
and kept in good working order at all times. The interceptor or
trap shall limit the amount of grease discharge into the public
sewer system to levels not exceeding those permitted by
ALCOSAN. Oil/grease discharges shall not exceed 200 ppm
downstream of the interceptor or tap.
(b) It shall be the duty and responsibility of all owners, lessees or
agents of all food preparation facilities and restaurants to, at a
minimum of annually, inspect the grease interceptor or trap. A
written record shall be kept of all inspections. The inspection
record shall, at a minimum, list the name (inspector and
company), address and phone number of the inspection/
disposal company, the method and frequency of cleaning
scheduled and the date of the cleaning/inspection. Such
records shall be immediately presented to the Borough upon
request. A more frequent cleaning/inspection schedule may be
ordered to be performed by the facility when it is determined
by the Borough that the facility is discharging excessive
amounts of grease to the public sewer system.
(c) Grease and all debris removed from a trap or interceptor shall
only be disposed of at a facility approved by the Allegheny
County Health Department (ACHD) and/or the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Under no
circumstances shall this material be deposited into another
sanitary or storm sewer.
(d) Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at his/her expense, in continuously
efficient operations at all times. Interceptors shall be cleaned
at least once a week.
(e) Failure by the owner to properly clean and maintain these units
shall be considered sufficient cause for disconnection of
premises from the public sewer, and/or other enforcement
actions and penalties as provided for in this article and/or by
other, applicable law.
§ 212-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-51
1:345
§ 212-52. Pump station maintenance surcharge.
Due to the extra manpower, expertise, spare parts, and regular repair and
maintenance required by sanitary sewer system pump stations, the Borough
is hereby authorized to add a surcharge on top of sewer user charge/sewer
rental rate imposed pursuant to Article VII, Chapter 212, of the Code of
the Borough of Homestead to be assessed on all properties, residential or
otherwise, that utilize a portion of the Homestead Sanitary Sewer System
that requires the use of a pump station in order to pump wastewater
or sewage through the system. Said surcharge shall be set by resolution
in an amount calculated to cover all or part of the expense and cost of
maintaining the pump station in proper working order.
§ 212-53. Penalty.
(4) Rate of flow control. Grease interceptors shall be equipped with
devices to control the rate of water flow so that the water flow does
not exceed the rated flow.

shown on the "Municipal Stormwater Management District Map"
which is hereby adopted as a part of this section (Appendix B).64
B. General standards.
63.Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
64.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 222-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-3
1:373
(1) All proposed stormwater control measures shall be evaluated
according to the following performance standard:
(a) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are
reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or
other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required:
[1] To assure that stormwater, including stormwater collected
and/or directed through pipes, downspouts or other
stormwater collection and/or routing devices, shall not be
in any way directed or connected to the Borough's
combined sewer system. The stormwater management
plan must provide for the elimination of all stormwater
flow from the property to the combined sewer system.
[Amended 9-12-2013 by Ord. No. 1220; 5-12-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-02]
[2] To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise
adequately protects health and property from possible
injury.
(2) The stormwater management plan for the development site shall
consider all the stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
(3) No discharge of toxic materials shall be permitted into any
stormwater management system. Where required by federal and
state regulation, the landowner or developer shall be responsible
for obtaining a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit (NPDES) for stormwater discharges.
C. Water standards: designated Monongahela River Stormwater
Management Watershed.
(1) The stormwater performance standards contained in this section
are intended to implement the standards and criteria contained in
the Monongahela River Stormwater Management Plan, adopted
and approved in accordance with the Pennsylvania Storm Water
Management Act. If there is any discrepancy between the
provisions of this section and the standards and criteria of the plan,
or if the watershed plan is subsequently amended, then the
standards/criteria of the current watershed plan shall govern.
(2) Storm frequencies. Stormwater management facilities on all
development sites shall control the peak stormwater discharge for
the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year-storm
frequencies. The SCS twenty-four-hour, Type II Rainfall
Distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff for both
§ 222-3 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-3
1:374
pre- and postdevelopment conditions. The twenty-four-hour total
rainfall for these storm frequencies in the watershed are:
Storm Frequency
(years)
Rainfall Depth
(inches)
2 2.50
10 3.61
25 4.31
100 5.71
(3) Calculation methods.
(a) Development sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow
rates and runoff hydrographs from development sites,
calculations shall be performed using one of the following: SCS
publications, Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC I, Penn
State Runoff Model (PSRM) or Modified Rational Method.
(b) Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purposes
of designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater
runoff collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational
Method shall be applied. Rainfall intensities for design should
be obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation rainfall charts.
(c) Routing of hydrographs through detention/retention facilities
for the purpose of designing those facilities shall be
accomplished using the Modified-Puls Method or other
recognized reservoir routing method subject to the approval of
the municipality and county.
(d) Predevelopment conditions. Predevelopment conditions shall
be assumed to be those which exist on any site at the time of
adoption of the Monongahela River Stormwater Management
Plan. Hydrologic conditions for all areas with pervious cover
(i.e. fields, woods, lawn areas, pastures, cropland, etc) shall be
assumed to be in "good" condition, and the lowest
recommended SCS runoff curve number (CN) shall be applied
for all pervious land uses within the respective range for each
land use and hydrologic soil group.
(4) Release rate percentage.
(a) Definition. The release rate percentage defines the percentage
of the predevelopment peak rate of runoff that can be
discharged from an outfall on the site after development. It
applies uniformly to all land development or alterations within
a subarea. A listing of the release rate percentage by subarea
appears in Appendix A of this chapter;65 the subareas are
delineated on the Release Rate Percentage Maps.66
§ 222-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-3
1:375
(b) Procedure for use.
[1] Identify the specific subarea in which the development site
is located from the watershed map and obtain the subarea
release rate percentage from Appendix A and the
appropriate Release Rate Percentage Map.
[2] Compute the pre- and postdevelopment runoff
hydrographs for each stormwater outfall on the
development site using an acceptable calculation method
for the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
storms. Apply no on-site detention for stormwater
management, but include any techniques to minimize
impervious surfaces and/or increase the time of
concentration for stormwater runoff flowing from the
development site. If the postdevelopment peak runoff rate
and runoff volume are less than or equal to the
predevelopment peak runoff rate and volume, then
additional stormwater control shall not be required at that
outfall. If the postdevelopment peak runoff rate and
volume are greater than the predevelopment peak runoff
rate and volume, then stormwater detention shall be
required. The capacity of the detention facility shall be
calculated by multiplying the subarea release rate
percentage by the predevelopment rate of runoff from the
development site to determine the maximum allowable
release rate from any detention facility for the four
prescribed storm events.
(5) No harm evaluation.
(a) An applicant may seek to exceed the otherwise applicable
subarea release rate percentage by performing the "no harm
evaluation." This evaluation requires an independent
engineering analysis to demonstrate that other reasonable
options exist to prevent the occurrence of increased
stormwater runoff discharge rates and/or velocities or that
measures can be provided to prevent increased stormwater
discharge rates and/or velocities from increasing flood
elevations and accelerating erosion at all downstream points in
the watershed.
(b) A no-harm evaluation will be considered only in the following
instances:
[1] In the Monongahela River Watershed: only in instances
were the discharge to a stream channel from the
development site occurs directly to the Monongahela
65.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.
66.Editor's Note: The Maps are on file in the Borough offices.
§ 222-3 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-3
1:376
River, an adequately sized storm or combined sewer which
discharges directly into the Monongahela River, or
through a properly sized and designed regional
stormwater detention facility.
(c) The analysis for the no-harm evaluation shall be submitted to
the Municipal Engineer and Allegheny County Planning
Department for review and approval.
(d) The no-harm evaluation shall be prepared by a registered
engineer who is experienced in hydrology and hydraulics. The
no-harm evaluation analysis shall be completed using the
following procedure:
(e) The analysis shall be completed using the Penn State Runoff
Model (PSRM) in the following manner:
[1] Develop the runoff hydrograph(s) for the design storms of
the site and areas tributary to it using the PSRM for
predevelopment conditions using the land use
characterizations contained in the Monongahela River
Watershed Stormwater Management Plan.
[2] Develop the postdevelopment discharge hydrograph from
the proposed site using the PSRM. If no management or
controls are proposed, this would be equivalent to the
runoff hydrograph under the postdevelopment conditions.
If some management or controls are proposed, then the
runoff hydrograph under postdevelopment conditions
should be modified to reflect their effects on the rate,
volume and timing of discharges.
[3] Subtract the runoff hydrograph ordinates under
predevelopment conditions (step 1) from the discharge
hydrograph ordinates (step 2), maintaining the time scales
of both hydrographs for one-to-one correspondence.
[4] Obtain the PSRM for the existing conditions for the
Monongahela River Watershed from the county.
[5] Locate the subbasin(s) in which the proposed development
is located and into which the discharge hydrograph enters.
If more than one subbasin receives this incremental flow,
divide the flow accordingly.
[6] Add the incremental increase computed in step 3 to the
runoff hydrograph of the subbasin(s) identified in step 5.
[7] Route the adjusted runoff hydrograph through the
Monongahela River Watershed PSRM and note any
increase in peak flows which would occur in downstream
subbasins. If no increase is noted, then the no-harm has
§ 222-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-3
1:377
§ 222-4. Design criteria for stormwater management controls.
been demonstrated. If no increase is observed in peak
flows, the increased potential for erosion and/or
sedimentation in downstream channels resulting from any
change in the flood hydrograph predicted by the model
shall be evaluated. If no increased potential can be
demonstrated by appropriated technical means, then the
no-harm exemption may be requested.
[8] If an increase in peak flow is observed in any of the
downstream subbasins or increased potential for erosion
and/or sedimentation is indicated, the no-harm exemption
shall not be granted.
A. General criteria.
(1) Applicants may select runoff control techniques or a combination of
techniques, which are most suitable to control stormwater runoff
from the development site. All controls shall be subject to approval
of the Municipal Engineer. The Municipal Engineer may request
specific information on design and/or operating features of the
proposed stormwater controls in order to determine their
suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of this chapter.
(2) The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed
stormwater management techniques on any special soil conditions
or geological hazards which may exist on the development site. In
the event that such conditions are identified on the site, the
Municipal Engineer may require in-depth studies by a competent
geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater control methods may be
advisable or allowable at a particular development site.
(3) In developing a stormwater management plan for a particular site,
stormwater controls shall be selected according to the following
order of preference:
(a) Infiltration of runoff on-site.
(b) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
(c) Stormwater detention/retention structures.
(4) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A
combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements. Justification shall be
provided by the applicant for rejecting each of the preferred
practices based on actual site conditions.
B. Criteria for infiltration systems.
§ 222-3 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-4
1:378
(1) Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon local
soil and groundwater conditions.
(2) Infiltration systems greater than three feet deep shall be located at
least 10 feet from basement walls.
(3) Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from
commercial or industrial working or parking areas. This prohibition
does not extend to roof areas which are demonstrated to be
suitably protected from the effects of the commercial/industrial
activities.
(4) Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire drainage
area to the system has received final stabilization.
(5) The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an overflow
system with measures to provide a nonerosive velocity of flow
along its length and at the outfall.
C. Criteria for flow attenuation facilities.
(1) If flow attenuation facilities are employed to assist in the control of
peak rates of discharge, their effects must be quantified using the
SCS Technical Release (TR) 55 Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds or other approved method. The effects of the flow
attentuation facilities on travel time should be reflected in the
calculations.
(2) Flow attenuation facilities such as swales and natural depressions
should be properly graded to ensure positive drainage and avoid
prolonged ponding of water.
(3) Swales shall be properly vegetatively stabilized or otherwise lined
to prevent erosion.
(4) Swales shall be designed according to the recommendations
contained in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
D. Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
(1) If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that postdevelopment peak
runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those rates
defined by the subarea release rate percentage for the two-, ten-,
twenty-five-, and one-hundred-year-storm frequencies.
(2) All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures to
provide discharge control for the four designated storm
frequencies. Provisions shall also be made to safely pass the
postdevelopment one-hundred-year-storm runoff without damaging
(i.e., impairing the continued function of the facilities). Should any
stormwater management facilities qualify as a dam under PA DEP
§ 222-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-4
1:379
Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with those
regulations and meet the regulations concerning dam safety.
(3) Shared-storage facilities which provide detention of runoff for more
than one development site within a single subarea are encouraged
wherever feasible; and provided that such facilities meet the
criteria contained in this section. In addition, runoff from the
development sites involved shall be conveyed to the facility in a
manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as flooding or erosion) to
channels and properties located between the development site and
the shared-storage facilities.
(4) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple use facilities,
such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar recreational/open
space uses are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the
approval of the municipality and Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protections' Chapter 105 Regulations.
(5) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design
of the detention facilities include:
(a) Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion and bottoms of impoundment type structures
should be protected from soil erosion.
(b) Control and removal of debris both in the storage structure and
in all inlet or outlet devices shall be a design consideration.
(c) Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize safety
hazards.
(d) The water depth at the perimeter of a storage pond should be
limited to that which is safe for children. This is especially
necessary if bank slopes are steep or if ponds are full and
recirculating in dry periods. Restriction of access (fence, walls,
etc.) may be necessary depending on the location of the facility.
(e) Side slope of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of 2.5 to 1
horizontal to vertical dimension.
(f) Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area.
(g) Facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance, considering
the frequency and type of equipment that will be required.
E. Criteria for collection/conveyance facilities.
(1) All stormwater runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether
storm sewers or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in
accordance with the following basic standards:
§ 222-4 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-4
1:380
(a) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding
damage.
(b) Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and
french drains to the curb line storm sewer (if applicable). Low
side lots shall extend roof and french drains to a stormwater
collection/conveyance/control system or natural watercourse
in accordance with the approved stormwater management
plan for the development site.
(c) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fall.
(d) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such
as a stormwater control facility, curbed street, storm sewer or
natural watercourse.
(e) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall
be suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid
excessive velocities.
(2) Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they shall
comply with the following criteria:
(a) Where practical, designed to traverse under seeded and
planted areas. If constructed within 10 feet of road paving,
walks or other surfaced areas, drains shall have a narrow
trench and maximum compaction of backfill to prevent
settlement of the superimposed surface or development.
(b) Preferably installed after excavating and filling in the area to
be traversed is completed, unless the drain is installed in the
original ground with a minimum of three feet cover and/or
adequate protection during the fill construction.
(c) Designed: with cradle when traversing fill areas of
indeterminate stability, with anchors when gradient exceeds
20%, and with encasement or special backfill requirements
when traversing under a paved area.
(d) Designed to adequately handle the anticipated stormwater
flow and be economical to construct and maintain. The
minimum pipe size shall be 15 inches in diameter.
(e) Drain pipe, trenching, bedding and backfilling requirements
shall conform to the requirements of the municipality and/or
applicable PennDOT Specifications, Form 408.
§ 222-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-4

§ 222-5. Erosion and sedimentation controls.
§ 222-6. Maintenance of stormwater management controls.
(f) All corrugated metal pipe shall be polymer coated, and with
asbestos bonding and paved inverts where prone to erode. Pipe
within a municipal right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete
pipe with a minimum diameter of 15 inches.
(g) Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be adequate,
safe, self-cleaning and unobtrusive and consistent with
municipal standards.
(h) Appropriate grates shall be designed for all catch basins,
stormwater inlets and other entrance appurtenances.
(i) Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to conform to the slope of the finished grade.
Top castings of structures located in roads or parking areas
shall be machined or installed to preclude "rattling."
(j) Where proposed sewer connects with an existing storm sewer
system, the applicant shall demonstrate that sufficient capacity
exists in the downstream system to handle the additional flow.
(k) Storm sewer outfalls shall be equipped with energy dissipation
devices to prevent erosion and conform with applicable
requirements of the Pennsylvania DEP for stream
encroachments (Chapter 105 of Pennsylvania DEP Rules and
Regulations).
A. An erosion/sedimentation plan shall be prepared for each development
site in accordance with the Pennsylvania Erosion/Sedimentation
Regulations (25 PA Code, Chapter 102) and the standards and
guidelines of the County Conservation District.
B. Proposed erosion/sedimentation measures shall be submitted with the
stormwater management plan.
A. Maintenance responsibilities.
(1) The maintenance plan for stormwater management facilities
located on the development site shall establish responsibilities for
the continuing operation and maintenance of all proposed
stormwater control facilities, consistent with the following
principles:
(a) If a development consists of structures or lots which are to be
separately owned and in which streets sewers and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to the municipality,
stormwater control facilities should also be dedicated to and
maintained by the municipality.
§ 222-4 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-6
1:382
(b) If a development site is to be maintained in single ownership or
if sewers and other public improvements are to be privately
owned and maintained, then the ownership and maintenance
of stormwater control facilities should be the responsibility of
the owner or private management entity.
(2) The governing body, upon recommendation of the Municipal
Engineer, shall make the final determination on the continuing
maintenance responsibilities prior to final approval of the
stormwater management plan. The governing body reserves the
right to accept the ownership and operating responsibility for any
or all of the stormwater management controls.
B. Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater facilities.
(1) Prior to final approval of the site's stormwater management plan
the applicant and municipality shall execute a maintenance
agreement covering all stormwater control facilities which are to
be privately owned. The maintenance agreement shall be recorded
with the final subdivision/land development plan for the site. The
agreement shall stipulate that:
(a) All facilities shall be maintained in accordance with the
approved maintenance schedule and in a safe and attractive
manner.
(b) Easements and or rights-of-way shall be conveyed to the
municipality to assure access for periodic inspections by the
municipality and maintenance if required.
(c) The name, address and telephone number of the person or
company responsible for maintenance activities shall be filed
with the municipality. In the event of a change, new
information will be submitted to the municipality within 10
days of the change.
(d) If the facility owner fails to maintain the stormwater control
facilities, the municipality may perform the necessary
maintenance work or corrective work following due notice by
the municipality to the facility owner to correct the problem(s).
The facility owner shall reimburse the municipality for all
costs.
(2) Other items may be included in the agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all
facilities.
C. Municipal stormwater maintenance fund.
(1) Persons installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required to
pay a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater Maintenance
Fund to help defray costs of periodic inspections and maintenance
§ 222-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-6
1:383
§ 222-7. Stormwater plan requirements.
expenses. The amount of the deposit shall be determined as
follows:
(a) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained,
the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections
performed by the municipality for a period of 10 years, as
estimated by the Municipal Engineer. After that period of time,
inspections will be performed at the expense of the
municipality.
(b) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
municipality, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Municipal
Engineer will establish the estimated costs utilizing
information submitted by the applicant.
(c) The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The Municipal
Engineer shall determine the present worth equivalents which
shall be subject to the approval of the governing body.
(2) If a storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation
facility (e.g., ballfield, lake), the municipality may reduce or waive
the amount of the maintenance fund deposit based upon the value
of the land for public recreation purposes.
(3) If in the future a storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or
other storage facility, the unused portion of the maintenance fund
deposit will be applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and
connecting to the storm sewer system or other facility. Any amount
of the deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment are paid
will be returned to the depositor.
A. General requirements.
(1) No final subdivision/land development plan be approved, no permit
authorizing construction issued, or any earth moving or land
disturbance activity initiated until the final stormwater
management plan for the development site is approved in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Exemptions for small developments.
(1) At the time of application, the municipality shall determine if the
subdivision/land development qualifies as a small development and
therefore, is eligible for a simplified stormwater plan submission.
For the purposes of this chapter, a small development is any
subdivision or land development which results in (or will result
§ 222-6 HOMESTEAD CODE § 222-7
1:384
when fully constructed) the creation of 5,000 or less square feet of
impervious surface area.
(2) Applications for small developments shall include a plan which
describes the type and location of proposed on-site stormwater
management techniques or the proposed connection to an existing
storm sewer system. The plan should show accurately site
boundaries, five-foot interval contours, locations of watershed and/
or subarea boundaries on the site (if applicable) and any
watercourses, floodplains, or existing drainage facilities or
structures located on the site. The municipality reserves the right
to require that the plan be prepared by a registered professional
engineer, surveyor or landscape architect.
(3) The Municipal Engineer shall review and approve the proposed
provisions for stormwater management in accordance with the
standards and requirements of this chapter.
C. Stormwater plan contents.

§ 230-18. Criteria for approval of land development plans.
The Planning Commission and Borough Council shall approve a land
development plan only if it complies with all of the following criteria and
with the specific requirements for design and improvements contained in
Articles VI and VII of this chapter.
B. Traffic control devices. Whenever, as a result of additional traffic
generated by a proposed development, the traffic impact report
determines the need for a traffic signal or regulatory sign on any rightof-
way within or bounding the site, the developer shall be responsible
for installing the pro rata share of said devices and signs attributable to
the development.
C. Other traffic improvements. Whenever, as a result of additional traffic
generated by a proposed development, the traffic report identifies the
need for additional traffic lanes (acceleration, deceleration or turning)
or other traffic improvements on any right-of-way within or bounding
the site, the developer shall be responsible for installing the pro rata
share of said improvements attributable to the development. All reports
shall reflect appropriate target dates and analysis reflect full build-out
impact of the proposed development on levels of service and
considerations of growth in other traffic.
A. Land shall be suitable for the uses proposed. No land which contains
hazardous substances, or which is susceptible to flooding, subsidence
or sliding shall be developed until it has been made safe for the uses
proposed.
B. Land development shall preserve, to the maximum extent possible or as
may be required by municipal, county, state or federal law, significant
natural site features including but not limited to steep slopes, prime
agricultural soils, mature woodlands, wetlands and areas of significant
or unique vegetation or habitat.
C. Land development shall consider visual features of the site as identified
in the visual analysis report.
D. Land development shall preserve to the maximum extent possible
significant historic, architectural and archaeological resources present
on the site.
E. Land development shall minimize alteration of natural land forms, shall
not create abrupt or steep changes in elevation within the site or
between the site and adjacent areas and shall result in stable slopes.
F. Development on land which includes frontage along a river should
provide for public access to and along the riverfront and should
consider improvement of such areas in a manner suitable for public and
recreational use.
§ 230-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-18
1:443
G. Land development shall relate harmoniously to development in
adjacent areas and to development in the community as a whole, as
indicated by the following:
(1) Land development shall be consistent with current community
goals and objectives as these may be expressed in the Municipal
Comprehensive Plan, statements of community development
objectives, statements of zoning district purposes and other official
expressions of community development goals and policies for the
future.
(2) Land development shall comply with all standards and
requirements of the zoning district or districts in which it is located
and with all the applicable design standards and requirements for
improvement contained in these subdivision and land development
regulations.
(3) If a land development plan encompasses land in other
municipalities, approval by the Borough of the development plan
for land within its jurisdiction shall be conditioned upon provision
by the applicant of proof of approval (or similarly conditioned
approval) by all of the municipalities involved.
(4) Land development shall be compatible with plans and policies of
county, state and federal governments applicable to the site or
location of the proposed land development.
(5) Transportation, utility and open space systems within a land
development shall connect with and be coordinated with the overall
systems of the community or communities in which the
development is located.
H. Traffic generated by the land development shall not increase
congestion, create or increase hazards or unsafe conditions or cause a
reduction in the level of service provided by streets which provide
access to the land development. Where any of these impacts would
result from a proposed land development, the governing body may
require that the applicant pay a proportionate share of the cost of
capital improvements needed to mitigate the adverse impacts on any
right-of-way within or bounding the site caused by the proposed land
development.
I. The design of a land development shall create attractive and usable
sites for buildings, with all necessary improvements.
(1) Every lot, parcel or building site within a land development shall be
provided with approved sanitary sewage facilities and potable
water supply, and natural gas, electric, telephone and other public
utility services accessible to the land development.
(2) Every lot, parcel or building site within a land development shall
have an area large enough to accommodate the proposed use,
§ 230-18 HOMESTEAD CODE § 230-18
1:444
together with all parking, setback, buffer and other open space
areas required by the zoning regulations applicable to the site.
(3) Every lot, parcel or building site within a land development shall
have access to a street of sufficient capacity to serve the proposed
use and shall be accessible by emergency vehicles.
J. A land development shall provide water supply and hydrants for fire
fighting, streetlights, street signs, street trees and landscaping in
accordance with the requirements of the municipality or responsible
entity.
K. The land development shall provide facilities for the safe management
of stormwater runoff from the site in a manner which assures that no
increased risk of flooding on, adjacent or downstream of the site will
result from the land development. If the land development is located in
a watershed for which a watershed stormwater management plan is in
effect pursuant to the Pennsylvania Storm Water Management Act (Act
167 of 1978),81 then all stormwater management facilities shall be in
compliance with the watershed plan and its implementing ordinances.
L. If a land development is proposed to be developed in phases, the
phasing shall be such that:
(1) No building shall be occupied and no land shall be used until all
required improvements are in place to serve the building or land
proposed for occupancy or use.
(2) If improvements, including streets, or land are proposed for
dedication to and subsequent maintenance by the municipality,
acceptance by the municipality shall not occur until land to be
served by the publicly maintained improvements has been
developed and placed in use.
(3) The proposed timing and geographic phasing of the land
development shall be planned to minimize disruption of adjacent
areas and negative impacts upon the community caused by site
preparation and construction activities.
(4) The proposed land development will generate benefits to the
municipality which equal or exceed municipal costs associated with
construction and ongoing operation of land development.
(5) If any permit required by a public agency has not been issued or if
any required financial participation by a public agency has not
been committed at the time that an application for approval of a
preliminary land development plan is decided, then the approval
shall be conditioned upon receipt of all required permits and public
financial contributions.

the Borough and in at least one newspaper in general
circulation in the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County.
(c) Expressions of interest and offers to purchase or acquire the
resource shall be reported to the Planning Commission by the
applicant. If there are one or more such expressions or offers
and an agreement on price or other matters is not reached by
the applicant and an offering party, the Planning Commission
may require that an attorney or real estate broker acceptable
to all parties be retained to facilitate the negotiation of an
agreement. The cost for services of an attorney or real estate
broker shall be paid by the applicant.
(d) If there are no offers for acquisition of the resource after a
period of 90 days from the notifications and second date of
advertising required by Subsection B(2)(b) above, the
applicant may apply for a demolition permit. [Amended
12-10-1992 by Ord. No. 1031]
(e) If one or more offers is received and an agreement has not
been reached after 180 days from the time that the applicant
reported the offer to the Planning Commission, the applicant
may apply for a demolition permit unless the negotiation
process authorized by Subsection B(2)(c) above has been
initiated but has not been completed.
(3) No significant historic, architectural or archaeological site shall be
demolished without a permit. If demolition is authorized following
the procedures specified in Subsection B(2)(a) through (e) above,
issuance of a permit may be withheld for a period of six months in
order that the resource can be documented for historical records
purposes, provided that a request to perform the documentation
has been filed with the Borough by an organization with the skills
and resources to do so.

determine compatibility between adjoining land developments
containing dissimilar land uses.
D. Arrangement of buildings and site improvements.
(1) General. Buildings and uses within a land development shall be
arranged to assure harmonious and complimentary groupings of
uses and activities; visually attractive arrangement of buildings in
relation to other buildings, parking, service areas and open spaces;
the smooth flow of traffic; the safety and ease of pedestrian
movement; efficient provision of utilities and community services;
compatibility with existing developed areas; and minimal
disturbance of natural topography and vegetation.
(2) As required by zoning. The arrangement and spacing of buildings
within a land development shall comply with the specific
requirements for setbacks, buffer yards and other open areas
required by the zoning district or districts within which the land
development is located.
(3) Energy conservation. To the maximum extent feasible, buildings

the height of an adjacent existing building outside of the land
development. Yards, setbacks and buffer yards required by zoning
may constitute all or a portion of the distance required by this
provision.
(7) Light access. Any building wall containing windows required for
natural light shall be separated from any other building wall a
distance which is sufficient to admit light in accordance with the
following standard and formula for determining light access:
(a) Area for light access shall be that area enclosed by:
[1] An arc extending 70° on each side of a line perpendicular
to the building wall at the center line of any affected
window; and
§ 230-40 HOMESTEAD CODE § 230-40
1:468
[2] The exterior radii of such arc which shall be 40 feet in
length for residential uses and 20 feet in length for other
main uses. The radii shall be measured from the exterior
face of the building wall at sill level at the center line of the
affected window. For this purpose, when a sill is less than
2 1/2 feet above floor level, sill level shall be assumed to be
2 1/2 feet above floor level.
(b) Units of light access. In each area for light access as defined
above, units of light access are the truncated sectors formed by
the intersections of:
[1] A series of radii projected from the center line of the
affected window and dividing the area for light access into
14 equal sectors of 10° each; and
[2] A series of concentric arcs centered upon the center line of
the affected window, and with radii of 20 feet, 30 feet and
40 feet for residential uses and 10 feet and 20 feet for
other main uses. A maximum of 28 units of light access are
thus available for residential uses and 14 units of light
access for other main uses.
(c) Requirements for light access
[1] For all affected windows in all buildings, at least eight
units of light access and the space between such units and
the affected window shall be unobstructed.
[2] Required unobstructed units of light access may be
counted within one or more of the following:
[a] Open space on the same lot.
[b] Space on adjoining lots, which, under the provisions of
Chapter 260, Zoning, is required to remain open.
[c] A street or way, private easement or other
permanently dedicated public or private open space.
[3] The following shall not be considered as obstructions when
located within required units of light access and an
affected window:
[a] Portions of the same building or other buildings or
structures whose height above sill level of the affected
window in question is not more than 2/3 of their
horizontal distance, measured at sill level from the
center line of the affected window, for the exterior
face of the building wall.
[b] Overhead obstructions on the same building wall,
such as cornices, awnings and balconies which do not
§ 230-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-40
1:469
project horizontally from the face of the building wall
beyond an inclined plane rising from the sill level at
an angle of 20° from the vertical exterior face of the
building.
[c] Spires; flagpoles; open fire escapes; and wire, chain
link or other fences.
(8) Residential open space. For land developments which include

such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of

applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough shall

Borough is located or, if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting shall appoint such
engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Borough Engineer
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by or
performed services for the Borough or the applicant within the
preceding five years.

fee of the appointed professional engineer.

WITHIN THE BOROUGH OF HOMESTEAD or WITHIN THE BOROUGH —
Within the corporate limits of the Borough.
§ 236-3. Levy of tax.
For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Borough during
the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any
length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for that year in the
amount of $40, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the
provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough Council from time
to time: 1) emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services; 2) road construction and/
or maintenance; 3) reduction of property taxes; or 4) property tax relief
through implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in
accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85, Subchapter F106 (relating to
homestead property exclusion). The Borough shall use no less than 25%
of the funds derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in
addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the
Borough. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
§ 236-4. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar
year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for
that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subparagraph, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army

Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the tax shall annually
file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the
person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough utilizes a
Collector, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
Collector. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the Borough for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt
of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
Borough or except as required by Subsection B(2), the employer
shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year
or the remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the exemption
certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Borough that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax
from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any

§ 236-5. Duty to collect and pay.
outstanding balances of tax due, and the Borough may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from a local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
(NOTE: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425; with respect
to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426.) Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to
remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is
later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for
refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
A. Employers.
(1) Each employer within the Borough, as well as those employers
situated outside the Borough but who engage in business within
the Borough, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax
from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him
within the Borough and making a return and payment thereof to
the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether
or not all such services are performed within the Borough.
(2) A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed
on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing
the combined rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the
calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection
of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for each payroll
period in which the person is engaging in an occupation, except as
provided in Subsection A(4) of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate
of the tax levied by the Steel Valley School District and the
Borough.
§ 236-4 HOMESTEAD CODE § 236-5
1:498
§ 236-6. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
(3) No person shall be subject to the payment of the tax by more than
one political subdivision during each payroll period.
(4) In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain
from withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay
statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax
withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employee's principal employer and the
employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place
of employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's
statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
(5) The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
(6) No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information
submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of
employment, the employee's principal office or where the employee
is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for
payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the
amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of Subsection B of § 236-4 of this article and this section
and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
(7) Employers shall be required to remit the taxes 30 days after the
end of each quarter of a calendar year.
B. Self-employed individuals. Each self-employed individual who performs
services of any type or kind or engages in any occupation or profession
within a primary place of employment within the Borough shall be
required to comply with this article and pay the pro rata portion of the
tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of
each quarter.
§ 236-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 236-7
1:499
§ 236-7. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records
to determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 236-8. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 236-9. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough but who perform services of any type
or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the Borough do,
by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the
provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this article with
the same force and effect as though they were residents of the Borough.
Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the Borough and an
employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this article,
be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not
paid, the Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the
employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 236-10. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council.
It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by
him from each employer or self-employed person, together with the
date the tax was received.

§ 236-11. Suits for collection.

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 236-13. Interpretation.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to Borough Council approval, to prescribe, adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to
the administration and enforcement of this article, including provisions
for the examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this
article, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this article and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have
occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall
have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where a suit is brought for the
recovery of this tax or another appropriate remedy is undertaken, the
individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for
the costs of collection.

calendar years thereafter, unless repealed or modified by ordinance of the

A. The Borough adopts the provisions of Article XI-D of the Tax Reform
Code of 1971, as amended,113 and imposes a realty transfer tax as
authorized under that article subject to the rate limitations therein.
Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or on whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof a
tax at the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by such
document, which tax shall be payable at the earlier of the time the
document is presented for recording or within 30 days of acceptance of
such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.
B. The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds
113. Editor's Note: See 72 P.S. § 8101-D et seq.
§ 236-36 HOMESTEAD CODE § 236-37
1:522
§ 236-38. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment or the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 236-39. Excluded transactions.
whereon the date of payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the
signature of the collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, No. 511, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq.,114 so that if any other political
subdivision shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same
person or transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough under the
authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and
such 1/2 of the rate shall become effective without any action on the
part of the Borough; provided, however, that the Borough and any other
political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, it shall bear interest as
prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal claims under the Act of
May 16, 1923 (P.L. 207, No. 153) (53 P.S. § 7101 et seq.), as amended,
known as the "Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act." The interest shall
be the lesser of the interest rate imposed upon delinquent
Commonwealth taxes as provided in Section 806 of the Act of April 9,
1929 (P.L. 343, No. 176) (72 P.S. § 806), as amended, known as the
"Fiscal Code," or the maximum interest rate permitted under the
Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act for tax claims.
E. The tax imposed under this article and all applicable interest and
penalties shall be administered, collected and enforced under the Local
Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, No. 511, as
amended;115 provided that if the correct amount of the tax is not paid by
the last date prescribed for timely payment, the Borough, pursuant to
Section 1102-D of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 (72 P.S. § 8102-D),
authorizes and directs the Department of Revenue of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine, collect and enforce the
tax, interest and penalties on the Borough's behalf.

year from the date of condemnation.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend

(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

The Police Department is hereby authorized to provide for the marking off
of individual parking spaces in the parking zones and areas designated and
described in § 240-37, said parking spaces to be designated by lines painted
or marked on the curbing or surface of the highway or area. At each space
so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a way that said
vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated.
§ 240-30. Installation of meters; operation.
§ 240-31. Manner of parking.
A. In said parking meter zones, parking meters shall be installed upon the
curb, sidewalk or pavement immediately adjacent to the parking spaces
provided in § 240-36 of this article. The Police Department shall be
responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use
of such parking meters.
B. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking
upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, for the period of time
hereinafter prescribed. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the
expiration of the lawful time limit it will indicate by a proper, visible
signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such case the
right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator,
owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties
hereinafter provided.
A. When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel with the
adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space
shall be parked so that the foremost part of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meter; provided, however, that where double
parking meters are installed upon one standard so as to serve two
parking spaces, any vehicle parked in the space just beyond the parking
meters shall be parked so that the rear bumper of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meters. When a parking space in any parking
meter zone is diagonal to the curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in
such parking space shall be parked with the foremost part of such
vehicle nearest to such meter.
B. Where lines or markings are painted or placed upon the curb, sidewalk,
highway and/or paved surface adjacent to each parking meter providing
for parking at an angle and not parallel or perpendicular to the curb, it
shall be unlawful for the operator of any motor vehicle to cross the
center line of the highway to enter or leave said parking area.
§ 240-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-32
1:587

operator shall, upon entering the said parking space, immediately deposit
or cause to be deposited such coin or coins of the United States as is
required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper instructions
on the parking meter, and failure to deposit such coin or coins shall
constitute a breach of this article and shall subject each person to the
penalty prescribed hereafter. Upon the deposit of such coin, or coins and
placing said meter in operation, the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of parking time which has been
prescribed for the zone in which said parking space is located, and for
which a coin or coins is or are deposited, as indicated on the parking meter.
If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit so fixed for such parking space, the parking meter shall,
by its violation signal, dial or pointer, indicate such illegal parking, and
in that event, such vehicle shall be considered as parked overtime and
beyond the period of legal parking time. The parking of a vehicle overtime
or beyond the period of legal parking time in any such space where any such
parking meter is located shall be a violation of this article and punishable
as hereinafter set forth.
§ 240-33. Violations.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this article for any
person:
A. To cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name of or
operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the period of

of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular
parking meter zone.

adjacent to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a signal
indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space has already
been parked beyond the period prescribed for such parking space.
C. To park any vehicle across any line or marking of a parking meter space
or in such position that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the area
designated by such lines or markings.

have passed from the date of the notice. The notice will include details
concerning the amount of fines and related fees, penalties and cost to be
paid in order to have the vehicle removed from the list. The notice will
also provide the owner with the right to request an administrative hearing
before a Borough hearing officer to show cause why the vehicle should
not be included on the list. The hearing will not be determinative of or
adjudicate the merits of any ticket, citation or violation issued but will be

towing and impoundment pursuant to this article. Such hearing must be
requested by the vehicle owner, in writing, within 10 business days of the

ARTICLE III
Districts, Permitted Uses
§ 260-12. Establishment of district classifications.
A. The Borough of Homestead is hereby divided into the following zoning
districts:
R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Medium-Density Residential District
R-3 Multifamily Residential District
C-1 Central Business District
C-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use Commercial District
C-3 Planned Commercial District_
WDD Waterfront Development District
POSP Parks Open Space Public District
B. Purpose of each district. In addition to purpose stated in the
Comprehensive Plan, the purposes of each zoning district are
summarized below.
(1) An R-1 District is intended to provide suitable locations principally
for single-family homes. Certain residentially related uses are also
allowed as conditional uses.
(2) An R-2 District provides for single-family dwellings, two-family
dwellings, triplexes and quadruplexes at moderate densities and
townhouses under special circumstances, along with certain
residentially related conditional uses.
(3) An R-3 District includes a mix of single-family and two-family
dwellings with garden apartments and townhouses, along with
certain residentially related conditional uses.
(4) The C-1 District encompasses the Borough's central commercial
core and provides for a wide variety of retail and service
commercial uses along with business, professional and medical
offices and related business uses. The orientation of this district is
toward the pedestrian rather than the automobile. The
preservation of historic resources and compatible reuses are
encouraged in this District.
(5) The intent of the C-2 District is to provide guidance and flexibility
for the development of a compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly
neighborhood commercial district. The purpose of this District is to
provide convenience goods and services to the residents of the
adjacent neighborhood. The District is ancillary and
complementary to the Eighth Avenue Business District and the
waterfront. The purposes of the District will be achieved through
§ 260-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-12
1:655
the development of a mixture of complementary land uses that
include small-scale convenience retail, commercial services, civic
uses and upper floor office space and residential uses in an
environment that is safe, comfortable and attractive to pedestrians
and encourages economic and social vitality and the linking of
trips. The District shall be designed in such a way that adjacent
land uses are well integrated with uses within comfortable walking
distance and are connected to each other with direct, convenient
and attractive sidewalks.
(6) The C-3 District provides an area of transition between the Central
Business District and the Planned Economic Reuse District where
certain heavier commercial uses which are not appropriate in the
Central Business District are permitted and where the adaptive
reuse of existing buildings and assembly of property for planned
commercial developments are encouraged.
(7) The WDD is intended to facilitate the development of large, underutilized
or vacant former industrial sites along the Monongahela
River which may be suitable for a variety of retail, office,
recreational and/or residential uses, provided that the
arrangement and design are carefully planned and implemented. It
is the intent of these provisions to allow considerable flexibility
within the WDD in the specific types of uses, their arrangement and
their intensity while assuring that:
(a) Uses within the WDD are either compatible in scale, intensity,
visual and operational characteristics, or, if different, are so
arranged that adverse impacts on adjacent properties are
minimized.
(b) All necessary utilities, facilities and site improvements are
provided in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 230,
Subdivision and Land Development.
(c) Negative impacts on the natural environment are avoided.
(d) Provision is made for the safe movement of people, goods and
vehicles without increasing congestion and/or creating
hazards within the WDD or within the area of impact in the
larger community.
(e) Each building site has adequate off-street parking, safe
pedestrian circulation, loading and unloading, light and air,
access for emergency vehicles and landscaped areas and open
spaces as may be required.
(f) The improvement of land and land uses within the WDD do not
adversely affect existing development in adjacent areas.

to the certificate of appropriateness requirements of § 260-37 and the
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
B. Conditional uses. Any uses allowed as conditional uses in the
underlying zoning districts shall be allowed as conditional uses in the
Historic Overlay District, subject to the requirements of this section
and the certificate of appropriateness requirements of § 260-37 below.
A. For all land and buildings located within an Historic Overlay District, a
certificate of appropriateness must be approved by the Borough
Council prior to the issuance of a building and/or demolition permit.
B. Activities requiring a certificate. With the exception of the uses and
activities described in Subsection C, Exempt activities, a certificate of
appropriateness will be required for the following:
(1) The erection of any building or structure, including signs, within an
Historic Overlay District;
(2) The reconstruction, alteration or restoration of the exterior of any
building or structure within an Historic Overlay District; or
(3) The razing, demolition or movement of any building or structure
within an Historic Overlay District.
C. Exempt activities. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required
for alterations to building interiors or for normal repairs and
maintenance to building exteriors, such as repainting, provided such
repair and maintenance activity does not include any change in color or
any structural alterations.
D. Application requirements. Applications for certificates of
appropriateness required by this section shall be made to the Zoning
Officer on forms provided, together with architectural sketches,
elevations and other information described on the application form.
E. Notice of public meetings. Prior to considering any application for a
certificate of appropriateness required by this section, the Historic
Architectural Review Board shall provide public notice of the date, time
and location of the public meeting at which the HARB shall consider the
application for any such certificate. Such notice shall appear at least
one time in a newspaper having general circulation in the Borough, and
shall appear no less than seven days prior to the date of such public
meeting.
F. Recommendation by the Historic Architectural Review Board. Within 15
days after the public meeting to consider the application for a
§ 260-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-37
1:721
§ 260-38. Criteria for review.
The recommendation and decision on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness shall be based on the following standards as are applicable
to the particular activity and/or use of the property and the buildings
thereon:
certificate of appropriateness, the HARB shall submit its written
recommendation to the Borough Council.
G. Action by the Borough Council. Within 45 days after receipt of the
recommendation from the HARB, or if no recommendation is received,
then 60 days after the public meeting, the Borough Council shall either:
(1) Issue the certificate of appropriateness;
(2) Issue the certificate of appropriateness subject to reasonable
conditions; or
(3) Deny the certificate of appropriateness.
H. Notice of decision. The Borough Council shall notify the applicant of its
decision in writing and, in the case of a denial, specify the reasons
therefore.
A. Standards for new construction. New construction in an Historic
Overlay District will be certified as appropriate if it is compatible with
the scale and basic design elements of adjacent and neighboring
buildings which are classified as significant and contributing and with
distinguishing site design elements of the district. The intent is not to
require or encourage new buildings to look like old buildings, but to
assure pleasing and harmonious relationships between old and new
that will maintain and strengthen the architectural character of the
historic district. The following design elements shall be considered in
the evaluation of the appropriateness of new construction:
(1) Building height. New buildings should be constructed to a
maximum height that is within 10% of the average height of
neighboring buildings.
(2) Elevation proportion. The relationship between the height and
width of the front elevation of a new building should be within 10%
of the average proportions of adjacent buildings.
(3) Proportion of openings. The relationship of height to width of
windows and doors of a building should be within 10% of the
proportions of windows and doors of adjacent buildings.
(4) Spacing of windows and doors. The spacing of windows and doors
in the front facade of a building should be similar to adjacent
buildings.
§ 260-37 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-38
1:722
(5) Horizontal lines. Header and sill lines of a building should be
located at similar heights or elevation as the horizontal lines of
adjacent buildings.
(6) Spacing of buildings on street. Setbacks and side yards of new
buildings should be similar to those on adjacent parcels. Placement
of sidewalks and projection of porches should be similar to adjacent
buildings.
(7) Roofs. The shape, style and material of the roof of a new building
should be similar to the roofs of adjacent and surrounding
buildings.
(8) Building materials. Building materials should be compatible with
materials commonly used within the historic district.
(9) Color. The predominant color of a building and the color of its trim
should be compatible with the colors of surrounding buildings.
(10) Architectural details. The use of specific architectural elements
and details such as porches, dormers, cornices, brackets, quoins,
balustrades and the like may be used to strengthen the relationship
of new construction to the existing architecture of the district.
However, such detailing is not sufficient to assure appropriateness
if the structure is not related to its surroundings in terms of
massing, rhythm and proportions.
(11) Landscaping. The use of plant materials that are traditional in the
district should be encouraged. Similarly encouraged is the use of
paving and fence materials that are traditional in the district.
B. Standards for rehabilitation. Except as provided in Subsection C below,
the following standards for rehabilitation shall be used by the HARB
when determining if a rehabilitation project is appropriate. These
standards are a section of the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for
Historic Preservation Projects," and appear in Title 36 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 1208 (formerly 36 CFR Part 67).
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
§ 260-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-38
1:723
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural feature should be
based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
(10) Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
C. Standards for additions to noncontributing structures. The
appropriateness of additions to noncontributing structures in historic
districts shall be judged primarily in terms of their visual impact on
nearby properties. Additions should generally be certified as
appropriate if their size is minor in relation to the total structure and if
they do not significantly increase the visual appearance of
incompatibility between the noncontributing structure and neighboring
structures which are contributing or significant.
D. Standards for signs. All signs within the Historic Overlay District shall
comply with the sign regulations which are applicable in the underlying
zoning district, unless excepted under the provision of this subsection
§ 260-38 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-38
1:724
hereunder, and with the additional special standards for signs
contained elsewhere in the Borough's Zoning Chapter.
(1) A sign which meets the requirements of the underlying district
must still be certified as appropriate in relation to the specific
building on which it is to be located and in terms of compatibility
with signs in the surrounding area; compliance with the underlying
zoning district requirements does not guarantee approval of a
certificate of appropriateness.
(2) The HARB may recommend and the Borough Council may issue a
certificate of appropriateness for a sign which is not permitted by
the regulations of the underlying zoning district if the proposed
sign is shown to be historically accurate by documentation
acceptable to the HARB.
(3) In addition to the sign regulations found in Article IX, the following
shall apply.
(a) No flashing, animated or glaring signs will be permitted.
(b) Signs will be placed on the face of the building, except for
entrance and directional signs or a ground-mounted
identification sign as an alternate to an identification sign on
the building.
(c) No building-mounted sign shall project above the roofline of
the building.
(d) Only open lettering will be permitted and at a size that is
appropriate to the scale of the building; however, each letter
will not exceed a maximum height of six feet.
(e) Sign copy shall be restricted to the company name, logo and
principal product.
(f) Directional signs will be of a uniform type and permanent
quality and will not exceed four square feet in area
(g) Ground-mounted identification signs will not exceed 35 square
feet in area.
(h) No billboards or similar advertising signs will be permitted
except a sign advertising a property for sale.
E. Standards for demolition or relocation of structures.
(1) In the case of a building to be razed, demolished or moved, the
HARB and the Borough Council shall consider the extent to which
the loss of the building will detract from the Historic Overlay
District and the purposes of this section and the public benefit to be
gained by preserving the building or district in comparison to any
loss or hardship to be suffered by the property owner.
§ 260-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-38
1:725
§ 260-39. Demolition by neglect. [Amended 8-8-2013 by Ord. No.
1218]
§ 260-40. Enforcement. [Amended 8-8-2013 by Ord. No. 1218]
(2) If the initial recommendation of the HARB is against the proposed
demolition, a period of 90 days shall be provided during which the
HARB shall attempt to negotiate with the applicant in order to
achieve an acceptable alternative to the proposed demolition. If
agreement is not reached by the end of the ninety-day period, the
HARB shall transmit its negative recommendation to the Borough
Council, which shall issue or deny a certificate of appropriateness
based on its consideration of all of the information presented. If the
Borough Council authorizes issuance of a permit for demolition
after a negative recommendation from the HARB, a permit shall not
be issued for 10 days, during which time the HARB may request,
and the Borough Council may order that issuance of a permit be
delayed for an additional 90 days in order to allow documentation
of the resource prior to its destruction.
A. Condition. No person owing any building or structure within the
Historic Overlay District shall permit or cause such building or
structure to suffer demolition by neglect.
B. Definition. "Demolition by neglect" exists where there is:
(1) Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports, roofs or
other horizontal members and external chimneys, such that the
structural integrity of the building may be threatened or
compromised;
(2) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or other
horizontal members and external chimneys, such that the
structural integrity of the building may be threatened or
compromised;
(3) Significant rotting and forms of decay;
(4) Missing, damaged or broken exterior doors or windows that, as a
result of their being missing, damaged or broken and not being
boarded up or otherwise secured to remedy their missing, broken
or damaged condition: a) facilitate possible ingress or egress by
trespassers, vagrants, or others intending to enter the structure or
building without proper legal authority or permission to do so; b)
allow precipitation to enter the interior of the building or structure;
and/or c) allow insects, rodents and/or other pests or vermin to
gain access to the interior of the building or structure.
(5) Creation of any hazardous or unsafe condition or conditions.
A. Code Enforcement Officer. The Code Enforcement Officer shall have
such power to institute a proceeding at law or in equity to enforce the
§ 260-38 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-40
1:726
provisions of this article as is provided elsewhere in the Code of the
Borough.
B. Fines.
(1) Any person demolishing or razing or causing the demolition or
razing of all or part of any building or structure without first
obtaining a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with this
article shall be fined $500.
(2) Any person permitting or causing demolition by neglect shall be
subject to a fine of $100 per day for every day that said condition
remains unabated or uncorrected after having received written
notice of such condition from the Borough. For each missing,
broken or damaged exterior door or window of such building or
structure existing in violation of this chapter, said person shall
additionally and separately pay a fine of: a) $100 per day, per door,
for each missing, damaged or broken exterior door existing in
violation of this chapter; and b) a fine of $100 per day, per window,
for each missing, damaged or broken exterior window existing in
violation of this chapter.

ARTICLE VII
Environmental Performance Standards
§ 260-41. General intent.
All uses hereafter established in any zoning district shall comply with
the performance standards contained in this section. The performance
standards shall apply to an existing use or structure, or portion thereof,
when it is extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed.
A. Fire and explosive hazards. All activities and all storage of flammable
and explosive material at any location shall be provided with adequate
safety devices against the hazards of fire and explosion and adequate
fire-fighting equipment as specified by the Department of Labor and
Industry, the laws of the commonwealth and Chapter 143, Fire
Prevention.154 All buildings and structures and activities within such
buildings and structures shall conform to the Borough building and fire
codes and other applicable ordinances.
B. Radioactivity and/or electrical disturbances. There shall be no activities
which emit radioactivity at any location beyond the most recent
threshold limit values adopted by the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists and the National Council on
Radiation Protection and Measurements and their reports, Nos. 39 and
22. There shall be no radio or electrical disturbance adversely affecting
the operation of equipment belonging to someone other than the
creator with no violation of the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists standard. The standards are contained in the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists 1990-1991
Threshold Limit Values for Physical Agents in the Work Environment
and 1990-1991 Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and
Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices.
C. Smoke, ash or dust. There shall be no emission of smoke, ash, dust or
volatile organic compounds which violates applicable federal, state or
county laws and regulations. In determining compliance with the visible
emission standards of the rules and regulations of the Allegheny County
Health Department, the following EPA Method 9 shall be used, except
that the averaging provisions of Paragraph 2.5 of Method 9 shall not
apply. Rather than applying the averaging provisions of Method 9, each
momentary observation that is recorded shall be deemed to represent
the opacity of emissions for a fifteen-second period. Each observation
which is recorded to be equal to or greater than 20% opacity shall be
counted in determining the hourly aggregated period.
D. Liquid and solid wastes. There shall be no discharge at any point into
any public or private sewerage system, watercourse or into the ground
of any materials, in such a way or of such a nature, as will contaminate
154. Editor's Note: Chapter 143, Fire Prevention, was superseded 4-8-2004 by Ord. No. 1154,
which adopted the Uniform Construction Codes.
§ 260-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-41
1:729
or otherwise cause the emission of hazardous materials in violation of
any federal, state, county or Borough laws and regulations. All required
discharge and disposal permits shall be obtained.
E. Glare.
(1) No direct or reflected glare, whether from any lighting source or
production operation, shall be visible from adjoining public streets
or adjacent lots when viewed by a person standing on ground level.
Glare shall be defined as direct or indirect light from such activities
of greater than 1/2 footcandle on any adjoining property.
(2) All lighting devices located within 100 feet of a property line
adjoining residential use or zoning classification shall be designed
with shields, reflectors or fractor panels which direct and cut off
the light at a cutoff angle that is less than 90°. ("Cutoff angle" is
defined as the angle formed by a line drawn from the direction of
light rays at the light source and a line perpendicular to the ground
from the light source above which no light is emitted).
F. Odor. There shall be no emission of odorous gases or other matter in
such quantities as to be offensive on adjoining streets or adjacent lots.
Odor thresholds shall be measured in accordance with ASTM d 1391-57
Standard Method for Measurement of Odor in Atmospheres (Dilution
Method).
G. Noise. No operation or activity shall cause or create noise in excess of
the sound levels prescribed below. For the purpose of this chapter, the
noise level shall be measured in decibels (dBa) which indicate the sound
pressure level obtained from a frequency-weighing network
corresponding to the A-scale on a standard sound level meter.
(1) Residential uses. At no point on or beyond the boundary of any lot
within these districts shall the exterior noise level resulting from
any use or activity located on such lot exceed a maximum of 45 dBa
for four hours in any twenty-four-hour period.
(2) Commercial uses. At no point on or beyond the boundary of any lot
within these districts shall the exterior noise level resulting from
any use or activity located on such lot exceed a maximum of 50 dBa
for four hours in any twenty-four-hour period.
(3) Industrial uses. At no point on or beyond the boundary of any lot
within these districts shall the exterior noise level resulting from
any use or activity located on such lot exceed a maximum of 60 dBa
for four hours in any twenty-four-hour period.
(4) Where two different uses for which different noise levels are
prescribed share a common boundary, the most restrictive of the
noise level standards shall govern.
§ 260-41 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-41
1:730
(5) The following uses or activities shall be exempted from the noise
regulations: noises emanating from construction and/or
maintenance activities between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.; and noises
caused by safety signals, warning devices and other emergencyrelated
activities or uses.
(6) In addition to the above regulations, all uses and activities within
the Borough shall conform to any applicable county, state or federal
noise regulations. Wherever the regulations contained herein are
in variance with any other lawfully adopted rules or requirements,
the more restrictive shall govern.
H. Vibrations.
(1) Vibration shall be measured at or beyond any adjacent lot line or
residential district line as indicated in Table A below, and such
measurements shall not exceed the particle velocities so
designated. The instrument used for these measurements shall be a
three-component measuring system capable of simultaneous
measurement of vibration in three mutually perpendicular
directions. The maximum vibration is given as particle velocity,
which may be measured directly with suitable instrumentation or
computed on the basis of displacement and frequency. When
computed, the following formula shall be used:
P.V. = 6.28 F x D
P.V. = Particle velocity, inches per second
F = Vibration frequency, cycles per second
D = Single amplitude displacement of the vibration, in
inches
(2) The maximum particle velocity shall be the vector sum of the three
individual components recorded. Such particle velocity shall not
exceed the values given in Table A. Where vibration is produced as
discrete impulses, and such impulses do not exceed a frequency of
100 per minute, then the values in Table A may be multiplied by
two.

vermin-resistant containers and shall be screened from public view.
§ 260-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-41
1:731
J. Determination of compliance.
(1) If during the review of a zoning application it appears that the
proposed use or development may violate the performance
standards contained in this section, the Borough may initiate an
investigation and may require the applicant to submit such data
and evidence as is needed to make an objective determination. The
evidence may include, but shall not be limited, to such items as:
(a) Plans of the existing or proposed constructions and
development;
(b) A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes
and products;
(c) Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or
proposed to be used in restricting the possible emission of any
of the dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this
article; and/or
(d) Measurements of the amount or rate of emission of said
dangerous and objectionable elements.
(2) In order to determine compliance, the Borough may seek
assistance from any governmental agency having interest in or
jurisdiction for the particular environmental issue. The Borough
may also require the applicant to submit competent substantial
evidence that the proposed use does comply with the performance
standard(s). The technical expert(s) providing the evidence shall be
a person(s) or firm(s) mutually acceptable to the Borough and
applicant; in the event that agreement cannot be reached on the
technical expert, the Borough shall make the selection. The cost of
the expert's study and report shall be borne by the applicant. A
negative report by the technical expert as to the proposed use's
compliance with the performance standard(s), and the applicant's
refusal or inability to make alterations to ensure compliance, shall
be a basis for denying approval of the zoning application.
K. Continuing enforcement.
(1) If after issuance of a certificate of occupancy, there is an alleged
violation of the performed standards of this section, the Zoning
Officer shall investigate the alleged violation and, subject to the
approval by Borough Council, may require competent substantial
evidence to assist in the determination of a violation.
(2) The Zoning Officer shall follow the procedures specified by this
chapter for giving a notice of violation. Costs of technical experts
employed by the Borough in determining the violation shall be paid
by the owner or operator of the use, if the use is found to be in
violation. If the use is found not to be in violation, the costs of
technical experts shall be paid by the Borough. Any use found in
§ 260-41 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-41
1:732
§ 260-42. Stormwater management.155
§ 260-43. Erosion/sedimentation control.
violation of these performance standards shall be further subject to
the enforcement provisions of this chapter.
A. Performance standard. Any landowner or person engaged in the
alteration or development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent injury to health or property. Such measures shall
include such actions as are required to:
(1) Assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no greater
after development than prior to development activities; or
(2) Manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and
property from possible injury.
B. Stormwater plan requirements.
(1) When required by this chapter, the applicant shall submit a
stormwater management plan for the land development prepared
and sealed by a registered professional engineer or landscape
architect of demonstrated qualifications in stormwater
management, along with all calculations and analyses used to
prepare the plan. All calculations of pre- and post-development
runoff and storage requirements for sites exceeding one acre shall
be completed using the United States Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) Soil Cover Complex Method (as contained in SCS Technical
Release TR-55). These calculations are to be computed by a
registered civil engineer or registered soils engineer. The rational
method may be used for land development sites less than one acre.
(2) If the land development is located within a watershed for which a
stormwater management plan has been adopted or is being
prepared, pursuant to the State Storm Water Management Act (167
of 1978),156 then any proposed stormwater control measures shall
be consistent with the watershed plan.
(3) If the development is proposing to connect with existing storm
sewers, the applicant shall demonstrate that the system has the
capacity to handle the additional stormwater flow. All connections
shall be approved by the Borough Engineer.
C. Plan approval. The stormwater management plan for the development
site and all proposed control measures shall be reviewed and approved
by the Borough Engineer.
155. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 222, Stormwater Management.

§ 260-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-43
1:733
§ 260-44. Hazardous, toxic and radioactive waste management.
Any landowner or person engaged in the alteration or development of
land which reasonably may be suspected of containing hazardous, toxic or
radioactive waste (HTRW), because of past use or practice, shall provide
an environmental assessment by a qualified professional engineer. If the
environmental assessment indicates presence of HTRW, a plan completed
by a qualified professional engineer for removal and proper disposal of the
hazard shall be submitted, along with a description of the rationale for
the plan as well as necessary background computations, for review and
approval by the Borough Engineer. Costs of review and approval, including
any necessary consultants, shall be borne by the developer. All HTRW
inspection and handling will be in accordance with the latest United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or other applicable federal,
state, county or municipal guidelines.
§ 260-45. Wetlands review.
A. Applicability. Where any excavation, grading or earthmoving activity,
including removal of topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover of land, is
proposed, a plan for minimizing soil erosion and sedimentation, both
during and after construction, is required.
B. Erosion/sedimentation plan. The erosion/sedimentation plan shall be
prepared in accordance with the Pennsylvania Erosion and
Sedimentation Regulations (25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102) and the
standards and specifications of the Allegheny County Conservation
District.
C. Plan review. The Borough may submit the erosion/sedimentation plan to
the County Conservation District for review and comment.
A. If the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough Engineer or the
County Conservation District or DEP or the Fish and Wildlife Service or
the Army Corps of Engineers, has reason to believe that a portion of a
site proposed to be altered may possibly meet the state or federal
definitions of a wetland, the Zoning Officer may require the applicant to
provide a study by a qualified professional delineating the locations of
wetlands. However, the Borough accepts no responsibility to identify all
wetlands or to warn all parties of such possibilities.
B. All permits of the Borough are issued on the condition that the
applicant comply with federal and state wetlands regulations, and such
permits may be revoked or suspended by the Zoning Officer for
noncompliance with the regulations.

ARTICLE VIII
Floodplain Management Standards
§ 260-46. Purpose.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and life,
the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and
governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of
public funds for flood protection and relief and the impairment of the tax
base by:
§ 260-47. General provisions.
A. Regulating uses, activities and development which, acting alone or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies;
B. Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development from
locating within areas subject to flooding;
C. Requiring or prohibiting certain uses, activities and developments that
do occur in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed
against flooding and flood damage; and
D. Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
A. Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
Borough of Homestead and as shown as being located within the
boundaries of the designated floodplain areas.
B. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged or structurally altered, except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this article and any other applicable ordinances
and regulations which may apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this
article.
C. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.
This article does not imply that areas outside the floodplain areas
or that land uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.

1:735
§ 260-48. Delineation of floodplain areas.
from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
A. Overlay concept. The floodplain areas described in this section shall be
overlays to the underlying zoning districts shown on the Official Zoning
Map.157 The provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions. Where there happens
to be any conflict between the provisions or requirements of any of the
floodplain districts and those of any underlying districts, the more
restrictive provisions shall apply.
B. Description of floodplain areas.
(1) The various floodplain overlay districts shall include areas subject
to inundation by waters of the one-hundred-year flood. The basis
for the delineation of these districts shall be the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) for the Borough of Homestead.
(2) The following kinds of floodplain areas are delineated for the
purposes of this article:
(a) The Floodway Area (FW) is delineated using the criteria that a
certain area within the floodplain must be capable of carrying
the waters of the one-hundred-year flood without increasing
the water surface elevation of flood more than one foot at any
point. The areas included in this area are specifically defined in
the Floodway Data Table of the above-referenced Flood
Insurance Study and shown on the accompanying Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map. 158
(b) The Flood Fringe Area (FF) shall be that area of the onehundred-
year floodplain not included in the floodway area. The
basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the onehundred-
year flood elevation contained in the flood profiles of
the above-referenced FIS and as shown on the accompanying
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
(c) General Floodplain Area (FA).
[1] The General Floodplain Area (FA) shall be that floodplain
area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations have
been provided. They are shown on the maps accompanying
the FIS prepared by FEMA. Where the specific onehundred-
year elevation cannot be determined for this area
using other sources of data such as the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Floodplain Information Reports,
United States Geological Survey Flood-prone

development or activity shall determine this elevation in
accordance with hydrological and hydraulic engineering
techniques. The applicant shall also delineate a floodway
area and provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate
that the proposed activity, together with all other existing
and anticipated development, uses and activities, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the one-hundredyear
flood more than one foot at any point. The
engineering principle of equal reduction of conveyance
shall be used to make the determination of increase in
flood heights.
[2] Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Borough Engineer.
C. Changes in floodplain area delineations. The areas considered to be
floodplains may be revised or modified by Borough Council where
studies or information by a qualified agency or person documents the
need or possibility for such revision. Prior to any change in a floodplain
area identified in an FIS, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
D. Interpretation of area boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain areas shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determination in
accordance with the provisions of Article XIII of this chapter.
A. Permit required. A zoning certificate and building permit shall be
required for all construction and development in any floodplain area,
including the erection, moving, extension, structural alteration or

§ 260-70. Shared use of parking spaces.
A. Two or more uses may share a common parking area, provided that the
total spaces equal or exceed the sum of the spaces required for each
use individually. However, the Planning Commission may approve a
shared parking plan which permits a reduction in this total subject to
the following:
Shared Parking Formula Requirements
(1) The intent of these shared parking requirements is to permit a
reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when
a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not
experience peak parking demands at the same time.
(2) When any land or building is developed under unified control
with a single development plan for two or more uses, as listed
below, the minimum total number of required parking spaces
shall be determined by the following procedures:
(a) Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual
use as shown on the table in § 260-72 below, excluding
required handicapped parking spaces listed in § 260-75, by
the appropriate percentage listed in the table below for each
of the designated time periods.
(b) Add the resulting sum for each of the five vertical columns
for the table. The minimum parking requirement is the
highest sum resulting from the foregoing addition.
The maximum reduction under this provision shall be 25%.

specifically authorized by this chapter.
D. Temporary construction structures. Temporary structures and trailers
used in conjunction with construction work may not be moved onto a
site until the building permit has been issued, and must be removed
within 30 days after the completion of construction. Permits for such
temporary structures shall not exceed one year.
A. Buffer yards shall be required to separate different zoning districts
from each other and to separate uses within the same zoning district
that may have different impact characteristics in order to eliminate or
minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights,
signs, etc., and unsightly buildings or parking areas.
B. Determination of required buffer yard. To determine whether a buffer
yard is required on a parcel or between two parcels or uses, or between
a use and the street, consider the following:
(1) Identify whether any property line, or portion thereof, constitutes a
zoning district boundary line. If so, determine the zoning on both
sides of the line. Determine the buffer yard required by referring to
the Table of Required Buffer Yards contained in this section.
(2) Determine if the proposed development is a use which has
buffering required to separate that use from other uses.
(a) Where a proposed nonresidential use abuts an existing
residential use, a buffer yard shall be installed as per the Table
of Required Buffer Yards contained in this section.
(b) If the proposed use is a conditional use abutting an existing use
by right, a Buffer Yard A shall be installed
(c) Off- street parking/loading spaces. In all districts, off-street
parking areas containing more than 15 parking spaces shall be
effectively screened on each side by a wall, fence or densely
§ 260-77 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-78
1:782
planted compact evergreen hedge not less than three feet in
height. The parking spaces shall be arranged and designed so
as to prevent damage to, or intrusion into, such wall, fence or
hedge. Clear sight triangles, as defined by this chapter, shall
be maintained. Open parking areas for 50 or more cars shall be
interspersed with land forms or other appropriate landscape or
planted areas.
C. A buffer yard shall be provided along all property lines between
dissimilar uses which shall comprise a year-round visual screen at least
five feet in depth, unless otherwise specified by this chapter. The buffer
yard may consist of one or a combination of the following:
(1) Evergreen and deciduous plant material of varying species;
(2) An existing natural land form or wooded area; or
(3) A fence between five feet and eight feet in height with at least 60%
of the surface being opaque and complying with all applicable
provisions of this chapter.
D. When a planted buffer yard is utilized, it shall consist of a mix of
evergreen and deciduous plant materials. At the time of planting, the
evergreen material shall be sufficient to screen the property visually
and shall be a minimum of six feet in height at the time of planting. The
remainder of the plantings may be of varying lesser heights.
E. The property owner shall be responsible for the continuing
maintenance of all buffer yards, including the replacement of any dead
plant material. Buffer yards shall be kept clean of all debris, rubbish,
weeds and tall grass.
F. No structure shall be permitted within a required buffer yard, except an
authorized fence or wall, nor shall a buffer yard be used for parking,
loading, vehicular circulation, storage or any other purpose.
G. The buffer yard shall be continuous along property lines where they are
required, except for points of vehicular or pedestrian access. The
provisions for a clear sight triangle at all street and driveway
intersections shall apply.
H. The Planning Commission may authorize a modification in the
otherwise applicable buffer yard requirements where it determines
that:
(1) A greater buffer yard, or an element thereof, is required to
accomplish the purposes of this chapter; or
(2) The changes in elevation between abutting properties or other
natural features exist such that they decrease or eliminate the need
for the buffer yard at the points where the buffer yard is required
by this chapter.

§ 260-83. Continuation.
Subject to the provisions of this section, legal nonconforming uses of
buildings or land existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter may
be sold or otherwise transferred to new owners and may be continued even
though such does not conform with the provisions of this chapter for the
district in which it is located, as long as it remains otherwise lawful.
§ 260-84. Unlawful use not authorized.
Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as authorization for or approval
of the continuance of the use of structure or premises in violation of zoning
regulations in effect at the time of the effective date of this chapter.
§ 260-85. Alterations, repair, enlargement or reconstruction of
nonconforming structures.
§ 260-86. Alteration, enlargement or expansion of nonconforming
uses.
A. Nothing in this article shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe
by a proper authority.
B. A nonconforming building or structure (excluding signs) may be
altered, repaired, enlarged or reconstructed, provided that its
nonconformity is not increased and the structure complies with other
area and dimensional requirements of this chapter.
C. If a nonconforming structure is moved for any reason, it shall thereafter
conform to the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. If a nonconforming structure, or use thereof, is destroyed totally or
partially by fire, collapse, explosion or other disaster, it may be
reconstructed (and the nonconforming use thereof continued), if work
commences within one year of the date of destruction and is completed
within the time period specified in the building permit. However,
reconstruction shall not make the building or structure more
nonconforming, in any aspect, than it was prior to destruction and, if
feasible, shall make the building or structure more conforming and
reconstruction must comply with applicable state and local building
codes.
E. A lawful use in a nonconforming building or structure may expand
within the existing building.

1:791
§ 260-87. Change of nonconforming use.
When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming or more conforming
use, it shall not be subsequently changed to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use may be changed to a similar nonconforming use or one
which more closely conforms to the uses authorized in the zoning district.
A change of one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use shall
require conditional use approval by the Borough Council in accordance with
the conditional use procedures outlined in Article XI of this chapter and in
accordance with the following.
coverage (measured in square feet) if there is no building. Such
expansion shall:
(1) Comply with applicable area and dimensional requirements for the
zoning district in which it is located.

nonconforming.
(3) Not involve the extension of the nonconforming use onto any
zoning lot other than contiguous property owned at the time the
use became nonconforming.
(4) Not reduce or eliminate required off-street parking and/or loading
areas.
B. Extensions or enlargements of nonconforming uses as described in the
previous section shall not commence unless authorized as a conditional

expansion or enlargement exceeding the otherwise allowable
percentages where the expansion is to provide required off-street
parking or loading space or to correct a hazardous or unsafe condition
in violation of a local, county, state or federal law, and the expansion is
not materially detrimental to surrounding properties or the interests of
the Borough.
A. The proposed use shall be within the same type of use category as the
original nonconforming use, or shall be a use that more closely
conforms to the current district regulations. In making a determination
of similar uses, the Borough Council shall be guided by the Federal
Office of Management and Budget Standard Industrial Classification
Manual current edition and the list of permitted uses and conditional
uses in the district in which the property is located and in the district in
which the use is an authorized use.
B. The proposed use will not be any more objectionable than the original
nonconforming use in terms of congestion; traffic generation and
requirements for off-street parking and loading; outdoor storage of
waste materials, supplies and equipment; height, area and bulk of all
structures.

§ 260-88. Abandonment of nonconforming use.
A nonconforming use of a building or land which has been abandoned shall
not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. For purposes of this
section, the following circumstances, which shall not be exclusive, shall
contribute towards evidence of discontinuance or abandonment of a use.
§ 260-89. Discontinuance.
If an owner of a building or land which is occupied by a nonconforming
use desires to discontinue such use for an extended period of time but
intends to resume such use at a later date, the owner shall apply to the
Borough Council in writing for a certificate of continuance, stating the
reason for and duration of the discontinuance and the date upon which
such use will be resumed. Certificates of continuance shall be granted for
periods of up to six months or more if agreed upon by Borough Council. If no
certificate has been granted, subsequent use of such building or land shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, unless Borough Council
authorizes as a conditional use the resumption of the discontinued use. If a
certificate of continuance is granted and nonconforming use is not resumed,
the subsequent use shall be in conformity.
C. The proposed use can comply with the applicable district regulations
and the environmental performance standards, which are contained in
Article VII of this chapter.
A. Failure to maintain regular business hours, typical to normal for the use
(past operations of the use and/or industry standards may be used to
determine typical or normal hours); or
B. Failure to maintain equipment, supplies or stock in trade which would
be used for the active operation of the use; or
C. Failure to maintain utilities which would be used for the active
operations of the use; or

§ 260-90. Nonconforming lot of record.
§ 260-91. Nonconforming signs.
A. In any district, notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other
provision of this chapter, a building which complies with applicable
zoning requirements except for lot area and lot width may be erected
without a lot area and/or lot width variance, provided that the following
requirements are met.
(1) The lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned
separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time
when the creation of a lot of such size, at such location, was not
prohibited by any zoning ordinance then in effect.
(2) The lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from
adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the
creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning
ordinance or ordinances.
(3) All other applicable zoning district regulations can be met.

equal 50% or more of the sign's replacement value, then the sign shall
be brought into conformance as part of the repairs.
C. A nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged or altered in any aspect,
except to make safety improvements or changes which will make the
sign conforming, or more conforming, to the provisions of this chapter,
except that the interchange of advertising panels shall be permitted.
D. Termination by abandonment. Any nonconforming sign, the use of
which is discontinued for a period of 90 days, regardless of any intent to
resume or not to abandon such use, shall be deemed to be abandoned
and shall not thereafter be reestablished. Any period of such
discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material
shortages or forces of nature, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this subsection. If the period of
discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material
shortages or forces of nature exceeds 90 days after its first occurrence,
then the nonconforming sign shall be deemed to be abandoned and
shall not thereafter be reestablished.

§ 260-92. Registration of nonconformity.
§ 260-93. Status of conditional use.
Any use for which approval of a conditional has been granted as provided
by this chapter shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use, but it shall
be deemed a lawful conforming use. Where a use exists at the effective date
of this chapter and is allowed by this chapter as a conditional use in the
Zoning District in which it is located, then it shall be deemed to be a lawful
conforming use in such zoning district.
§ 260-94. Historic lands.
The Borough Council may modify the applicable provisions for expansion,
enlargement or alteration of a nonconforming structure which has been
designated as an historic landmark by the Pennsylvania Historical
Commission or placed on the National Register of Historic Places or for
which application for such designation or placement has been made, in
order to achieve the goals of historic preservation and/or implement plans
proposed for the preservation and economic reuse of the property.

area from one district to a district of a different classification, the foregoing
provisions shall apply to any nonconforming use, structure or lot of record
existing therein.
A. Purpose. The certificate of nonconformity shall establish the legality of
nonconforming uses, structures, lots and signs established prior to the
effective date of this chapter that do not conform to the regulations of
this chapter applicable in the zoning districts in which such
nonconformities are located. A certificate of nonconformity is required
for any nonconforming uses, structures, lots and signs prior to
expansion or change in accordance with the provisions of §§ 260-86 and
260-87 or prior to receipt of a certificate of continuance in accordance
with § 260-89.
B. Nonconforming uses. The owner of a nonconforming use shall make an
application for registration of the nonconforming use and, upon
presentation of documentation acceptable to the Zoning Officer that the
use was lawfully in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter
or any amendment which created the nonconformity, the Zoning Officer
shall register the same on a map and by Allegheny County Deed and
Assessment Registry Block and Lot Number as a legal nonconforming
use.
C. Nonconforming structures and lots. In the course of administering this
chapter and reviewing applications for zoning certificates or variances,

building; or
(d) Change a nonconforming use.

B. Procedure for obtaining a zoning certificate.
§ 260-96 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-97
1:798
(1) Whenever the proposed activity requires a building permit under
Chapter 110, Building Construction,166 the application for the
zoning certificate shall be made prior to or simultaneously with the
application for the building permit. However, the building permit
shall not be issued until the zoning certificate has been approved.
(2) When no building permit is required, the application for the zoning
certificate and certificate of occupancy may be made at any time
prior to the use or occupancy of the structure or land.
(3) Applications for a zoning certificate shall be submitted, in writing,
on such forms provided by the Borough along with payment of the
required fees in accordance with the Schedule of Fees.167 The
application shall be accompanied by a plot plan showing accurately
and completely the location, dimensions and nature of any lot and/
or structure involved in the application. The Zoning Officer may
request any information necessary to determine the application's
compliance with this chapter.
(4) The Zoning Officer shall not issue the zoning certificate until all
other required approvals and/or permits have been obtained from
Borough, county, state and federal agencies. The applicant shall
submit copies of such approvals/permits to the Zoning Officer.
C. Changes. After issuance of the zoning certificate, no changes of any
kind shall be made to the approved applications, plans and certificate
without written approval of the Zoning Officer, or in the case of a
conditional use approval, Borough Council. Requests for any such
change shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer.
D. Duration of zoning certificate. A zoning certificate shall expire within
six months from the date of issuance if the subject use is not
commenced or construction has not begun. All work must be completed
no later than two years from the date of issuance of the zoning
certificate. For purposes of this chapter, construction shall be
considered to have started with the preparation of land, land clearing,
grading, filling, excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations
erection of temporary forms, the installation of piling under proposed
subsurface footings, or the installation of sewer, gas and water lines or
electrical or other service lines from the street.
E. Inspections.
(1) In order to perform the functions of this chapter, the Zoning Officer
shall have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises,
property or development in the Borough upon presentation of
proper credentials, at any reasonable hour, to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
166. Editor's Note: Chapter 110, Building Construction, was superseded 4-8-2004 by Ord. No.
1154, which adopted the Uniform Construction Codes.
167. Editor's Note: The Schedule of Fees is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 260-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-97
1:799
§ 260-98. Schedule of fees.
The Borough may establish, from time to time, fees and charges for the
various permits, reviews and other actions required by this chapter. This
schedule, along with an explanation of the collection procedure, shall be
posted in the offices of the Zoning Officer. All fees and charges shall be
adopted by resolution of Borough Council at any regular or special meeting.
(2) During the construction/development period, the Zoning Officer or
other authorized official may inspect the premises to determine
that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the zoning application and with all applicable Borough
ordinances.
F. Revocation of zoning certificate. In the event that the Zoning Officer
discovers that the work does not comply with the approved application
or any applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false
statement or misrepresentation by any applicant, the Zoning Officer
shall revoke the zoning certificate and proceed with whatever legal
action is necessary to correct the violation.
G. Certificate of occupancy.
(1) A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained before any person may
occupy or use any structure or lot. An application for a zoning
certificate does not permit occupancy; a certificate of occupancy is
also required. A change in property ownership and/or business type
will necessitate the issuance of a new certificate of occupancy.
(2) Upon completion of the work covered by any zoning certificate or
before the occupancy of any land or structure, the applicant shall
notify the Zoning Officer, who shall examine such building,
structure or use of land within 10 days after notification. If the
Zoning Officer shall find that such construction, erection,
structural alteration or use of building and/or land is in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances and
the approved plans, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued.
H. Temporary occupancy permits. The Zoning Officer may issue a
temporary occupancy permit which may allow the use or occupancy of a
building or structure during structural alteration thereof or may permit
the partial use or occupancy of a building or structure during its
construction or erection; provided, however, that such a temporary
permit shall be valid only for a period not exceeding three months from
its issuance and shall be subject to such restrictions and provisions as
may be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to ensure the safety of
persons using or occupying the building, structure or land involved.
I. Permits issued in error. Any permit issued in conflict with the provisions
of this chapter shall be null and void.

A. Membership of the Board. The membership of the Zoning Hearing
Board shall be three residents of the Borough appointed by Borough
Council. Their terms of office shall be three years and so fixed that the

unexpired portion of the term. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board
shall hold no other office in the Borough, including membership on the
Planning Commission and Zoning Officer.
B. Removal of members. Any Zoning Hearing Board member may be
removed for malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in office or for
other just cause by a majority vote of Borough Council, taken after the

disqualification of a member, a quorum is not reached, the Chairman of
the Zoning Hearing Board shall designate as many alternate members
of the Zoning Hearing Board to sit on the Board as may be needed to
provide a quorum. Any alternate member of the Zoning Hearing Board
shall continue to serve on the Zoning Hearing Board in all proceedings
involving the matter or case for which the alternate was initially
appointed until the Zoning Hearing Board has made a final
determination of the matter or case. Designation of an alternate
pursuant to this subsection shall be made on a case-by-case basis in
rotation according to declining seniority among all alternates.
E. Organizations of the Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board
shall elect its officers from its own membership, who shall serve annual

Borough Council, the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or contract for
secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical
services. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties, as may be fixed by

respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said
hearings may include compensation for the secretary and members
of the Zoning Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs and
necessary administrative overhead connected with the hearing.
The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning
Hearing Board, expenses for engineering, architectural or other
technical consultants or expert witness costs.
(2) Stenographer's fees. The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing
officer, as the case may be, shall keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings and a transcript of the proceedings, and copies of the
graphic or written material received in evidence shall be made
available to any party at cost. The appearance fee for the
stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the
Zoning Hearing Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be
paid by the Zoning Hearing Board, if the transcript is ordered by
the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing officer, or shall be paid by the
person appealing from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if
such appeal is made, and in either event the cost of additional
copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies.
In other cases the party requesting the original transcripts shall
bear the cost thereof.

appeal taken with 30 days after the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter.
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but
not limited to the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act
on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist
§ 260-99 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-99
1:802
order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming
use, structure or lot.
(4) Appeals from a determination by the Borough Engineer or the
Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a
land use ordinance.
(5) Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter and flood

as amended).168
(8) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or
provision thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion
control and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to
development not involving subdivision and land development.
H. Variances.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear a request for a variance
where it is alleged that the strict application of the provisions of
this chapter inflicts unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.
Application for a variance shall be made on the prescribed form
obtained from the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer shall forward
the application to the Zoning Hearing Board, which shall determine
a time and place of the hearing.
(2) The Board may grant a variance, provided that the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Zoning Chapter in the neighborhood or
district.
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter; and the
168. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 260-99 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-99
1:803
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance which will afford relief and represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(3) A request for variance in any floodplain district shall be decided in
accordance with the provisions of § 260-53 of this chapter.
(4) In granting a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach
reasonable conditions, if warranted, including a time limitation on
the variance to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the
public and implement the purposes of this chapter.
I. Special exceptions. Where this chapter states that special exceptions
may be granted or denied by the Board, the Board shall hear and decide
requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such standards
and criteria as specified in Article XII of this chapter. In granting a
special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the chapter, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purpose of this chapter.
J. Applications to the Zoning Hearing Board. All applications and appeals
to the Zoning Hearing Board shall be in writing and shall refer to the
specific provision of this chapter which is involved and describe the
nature of the appeal, challenge or application for special exception use
or variance. The required fees shall be submitted with the application.
An appeal from a decision of the Zoning Officer or a validity challenge
may be filed by the affected landowner, by any officer or agency of the
Borough or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance may only be
filed by the landowner or a tenant with the permission of the landowner.
K. Time limitations.
(1) No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing
Board later than 30 days after a preliminary or final application for
development has been approved by an appropriate Borough officer,
agency or body, if such proceedings is designated to secure
reversal or to limit the approval in any manner, unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to
believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
§ 260-99 HOMESTEAD CODE § 260-99
1:804
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by
the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
(2) The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision by a Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity
of an ordinance or map filed pursuant to Section 916.2 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code169 shall preclude an
appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final
submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative
approval.

shall be mailed to all interested parties, including the applicant, the

1:805

written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing
before the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing officer. A decision by
the Zoning Hearing Board shall require the majority of any quorum
voting on the case. In the event that there is a tie vote, the case
shall be deemed denied.
(11) Where the application is contested or denied, each decision shall
be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon,
together with the reasons therefore. Conclusions based on any
provisions of this chapter or of any act, rule or regulation shall
contain a reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why

any principles of substantive law.
(b) Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the
particulars of each case and the willingness of the parties to
negotiate. Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, in

the mediating parties, assisted by the mediator as appropriate,
develop terms and conditions for:

the case may be, provided that there is written consent by
the mediating parties, and by an applicant or Borough
decision-making body, if either is not a party to the
mediation.
[5] Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity
to participate.
[6] Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or
all of the mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the
public.

authorized procedures set forth in this chapter.

M. Stay of proceedings.
(1) Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the
Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of
any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall be
stayed, unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency
or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that
such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which
case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board or the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Zoning
Hearing Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant
may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to
order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the
proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. The question
whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of
the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court.

shall be taken to the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas and
shall be filed within 30 days after the entry of the decision or, in the
case of a deemed decision, within 30 days after the date upon
which notice of said deemed decision is given.

involving administration of the provisions of this chapter may appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within
30 days after the decision or action of the Zoning Officer.
B. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct a
hearing on the appeal in accordance with the provisions of § 260-99K.

Allegheny County in accordance with the procedures prescribed in
Article X-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.

development of land in which he/she has an interest may submit a
curative amendment to Borough Council, as provided by the
Municipalities Planning Code.172 Borough Council shall commence a
hearing within 60 days of the request. Procedures for reviewing and
conducting hearings on the curative amendment shall be in accordance
with Section 908 of the Municipalities Planning Code173 governing
hearings conducted by the Zoning Hearing Board; provided, however,
that the provisions of Section 908(1.2) and (9) shall not apply and the

(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses essential to public health and welfare.
(2) Declaration of invalidity by the court. If the Borough does not
accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance
with this section and a court subsequently rules that the challenge
has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of

be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or
used in violation of this chapter, the Borough Council or, with the approval
of Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, may institute in the name
of the Borough any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent
in or about such premises any act, conduct, business or use constituting
a violation. These remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies
provided by law.

(4) Upon completion of the procedures as set forth in Subsections C(1)
and (2), no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
B of this section shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of the unamended zoning ordinance for which there has

(5) The Borough may not again utilize the above procedure for a
municipal curative amendment for a thirty-six-month period
following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment or the
reaffirmation of the validity of its zoning ordinance. However, if
after the date of declaration and proposal there is a substantially
new duty or obligation imposed upon the Borough by virtue of a
change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court

prepare a curative amendment to this chapter to fulfill said duty or
obligation.

the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found
liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the

including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result
thereof.
(1) No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the District

judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the District
Justice, determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
§ 260-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-103
1:813
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid
over to the Borough.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order to stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication

grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.

The Waterfront Development District ("WDD") is intended to facilitate the
development of large, under-utilized or vacant former industrial sites along
the Monongahela River which may be suitable for a variety of large-scale
industrial, retail, office, recreational, and/or residential uses, provided that
the arrangement and design of those uses are carefully planned and
implemented. These provisions are further intended to allow considerable
flexibility within the WDD in the specific types of uses, their arrangement
and their intensity while assuring that:
§ 260-119. Community development objectives.
A. Uses are either compatible in scale, intensity, visual and operational
characteristics, or, if different, are so arranged that adverse impacts on
adjacent properties are minimized.
B. All necessary utilities, facilities and site improvements are provided in
accordance with Borough requirements.
C. Negative environmental impacts are avoided.
D. Provision is made for the safe movement of people, goods, and vehicles
without increasing congestion and/or creating hazards within the WDD
and/or within the area of impact in the larger community.
E. Each building site has adequate off-street parking, safe pedestrian
circulation, light and air, access for emergency vehicles, and
landscaped areas and open spaces as may be required.
A. Development within the WDD should be physically integrated with the
community in the following ways:
(1) A system of public and private streets should be designed and
constructed in a way so as to insure coordination with streets
outside of the WDD.
(2) All utilities should be designated and installed in a manner which
insures coordination with the infrastructure systems serving the
Borough.
(3) Pedestrian and vehicular access to the riverfront should be
provided through the WDD.
(4) Land uses along the riverfront which permit public access to the
river should be encouraged.
§ 260-118 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-119
1:819
§ 260-120. Definitions.
(5) In order to enhance the Monongahela River as a scenic and
recreational community resource, the following design criteria
shall be adhered to:
(a) Strengthen the river's impact by enhancing views and creating
new ones.
(b) Focus on water-dependent and water-related uses along the
river by creating a balance of retail, residential, office and
recreational uses which will bring residents and visitors to the
riverfront.
(c) Create a wide variety of waterfront spaces such as
promenades, plazas, and tree lawns for walking, jogging,
shopping and dining, as well as for sitting and quiet
contemplation.
(d) Design public spaces to fit the changeable nature of the
riverfront on a daily, seasonal, and annual basis.
(e) Design riverfront spaces for public events and celebrations.
(f) Clearly define public access by emphasizing the line of the
riverfront's edge with pathways, promenades, and plazas that
give immediate and continuous public access along the river
while defining its physical boundary.
(g) Highlight public access to the riverfront with visual links such
as pedestrian-oriented streets and sidewalks, plazas and view
corridors, as well as appropriate site planning and building
design.
(h) Celebrate the site's history by incorporating that history into
street and building design. The site's history should be told
through informative signage, and public spaces for periodic
events and historical celebrations.
B. Development within the WDD should, to the extent possible:
(1) Provide employment opportunities.
(2) Contribute to the creation of a diversified job base within the
community.
(3) Contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the community
tax base.

WARDS
§ A266-1. Purpose.
WHEREAS, for many years there has been an inequality of population in
the existing three wards of the Borough of Homestead due, primarily, to the
elimination of two wards and the traditionally oversized Third Ward; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States has required
representation in local governments as nearly equal as possible; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
Articles 9 and 11, provides for local reapportionment by a local governing
body which is not elected at large; and
WHEREAS, unofficial figures from the 1970 Federal Decennial Census are
available to provide the basis for a reapportionment based upon such
figures; and
§ 260-125 HOMESTEAD CODE § A266-1
A265:846
WHEREAS, a committee appointed by the President of Council has studied
the problems at length and met with community and political leaders
regarding solutions to the same; and
WHEREAS, the committee, in order to comply with the aforesaid
requirements of the Supreme Court and Constitution, has recommended
that the ward system be continued under the reapportionment hereinafter
set forth which would require a minimum of changes to ward lines and
district lines and which would result in wards as nearly equal in population
as practicable as follows:

Estimated
Population
First (formerly
fourth)
2,029
